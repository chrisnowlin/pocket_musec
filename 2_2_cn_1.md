## Lesson Procedure

### Introduction/Hook (5 minutes)

**Activity**: “What’s in a Song?”  
- Play 15 seconds of each song (alternate: “This Land Is Your Land” → “Coyote’s Lullaby”) without naming them.  
- Ask: *“What do you hear? What feelings do these songs give you? Who might sing this?”*  
- Show picture cards and maps. Briefly introduce:  
  > “Today we’ll learn how music tells stories about people’s homes, families, and traditions — just like these two songs!”

**Connection to Prior Learning**:  
> “Remember when we sang ‘If You’re Happy and You Know It’? That’s a folk song too — passed down through families. Today we’ll explore songs from different American families!”

### Main Activities (20 minutes)

#### Activity 1: “This Land Is Your Land” — American Folk Heritage (7 min)

- **Model & Sing**: Teacher leads call-and-response on chorus:  
  > “This land is your land, this land is my land…”  
- **Discuss**:  
  > “Who wrote this? (Woody Guthrie) — He traveled America and wrote songs about regular people. What does ‘this land is your land’ mean? Who does it include?”  
- **Instrumental Play**: Students play steady beat on rhythm sticks or tambourines while singing chorus.  
- **Movement**: Walk in place during verses; sway during chorus.

#### Activity 2: “Coyote’s Lullaby” — Native American Tradition (7 min)

- **Listen & Observe**: Play lullaby. Ask:  
  > “How is this different? What instruments do you hear? (flute, drum, voice) Who might sing this? (a parent, elder, community member)”  
- **Cultural Connection**:  
  > “This lullaby comes from Native American families. It helps children feel safe and connected to nature and stories.”  
- **Movement**: Students sway gently with scarves or hands like wind or stars.  
- **Instrumental Play**: Students play soft, slow drumbeats or shake maracas gently.

#### Activity 3: “Song Stories” Comparison Chart (6 min)

- **Group Discussion**: Teacher creates anchor chart titled “How Music Tells Our Stories.”  
  Students contribute:  
  - *“This Land Is Your Land” → about land, people, freedom → instruments: guitar, voice → movement: walking*  
  - *“Coyote’s Lullaby” → about nature, family, calm → instruments: flute, drum → movement: swaying*  
- **Student Turn & Talk**: “Which song sounds like your family’s story? Why?”

### Closure/Reflection (5 minutes)

**Activity**: “My Song Story” Reflection Sheet  
Students draw one of the songs and write or dictate:  
> “This song is about __________. I like it because __________.”  

**Teacher Summary**:  
> “Music is a way people share who they are — their homes, families, and traditions. We’ll keep learning how songs connect us to each other!”

**Preview Next Lesson**:  
> “Next time, we’ll make our own song about our families and neighborhoods!”

## Assessment Strategies

### Formative Assessment:

- **Observation Checklist** (Teacher uses during activities):  
  ☐ Identifies at least one cultural group for each song  
  ☐ Describes one tradition or heritage element (lyrics, instruments, movement)  
  ☐ Participates in singing, playing, or moving with focus  

- **Reflection Sheet Rubric** (1 point each):  
  - **1 pt**: Draws a recognizable scene from one song  
  - **1 pt**: Writes/dictates a sentence connecting the song to culture or tradition  

### Success Criteria:

- **Emerging**: Can name one song and one instrument used.  
- **Proficient**: Can name both songs, identify one cultural group, and describe one tradition.  
- **Exemplary**: Can compare both songs using cultural vocabulary and personal connection.

## Differentiation

### For Struggling Learners:
- Provide sentence stems for reflection: “This song is about ______.”  
- Use visual icons (land, family, drum, guitar) to support verbal responses.  
- Pair with peer buddy for movement or instrument play.  
- Allow drawing-only responses if writing is challenging.

### For Advanced Learners:
- Challenge to name a third American folk song and guess its cultural roots.  
- Create a 2-beat rhythm pattern to accompany one song.  
- Write a new verse for “This Land Is Your Land” about their own neighborhood.

### For ELL/ESOL Students:
- Use gestures, visuals, and bilingual vocabulary cards (if applicable).  
- Allow responses in home language with teacher translation support.  
- Pair with a fluent peer for turn-and-talk.

### For Students with Physical Needs:
- Offer seated movement (hand motions, head nods, tapping lap).  
- Provide adaptive instruments (large-handled mallets, velcro drum straps).  
- Allow verbal or pictorial responses instead of writing.

## Reflection and Extension

### Student Reflection Questions:
- What did you learn about how music tells stories?  
- Which song felt most like your family’s story? Why?  
- How can we use music to learn about other people’s traditions?

### Homework/Extension Activities:
- **Family Connection**: Ask a family member to share a song from their heritage. Draw it and bring it to class next week.  
- **Creative Response**: Write or draw a new verse for one of the songs using your own neighborhood or family.  
- **Cross-Curricular Link**: In social studies, research a Native American tribe or Appalachian region and create a “cultural poster” with music, food, and clothing.

### Cross-Curricular Connections:
- **Social Studies**: Map regions, discuss cultural diversity in the U.S.  
- **Language Arts**: Compare song lyrics to poems; write original verses.  
- **Visual Arts**: Create a “song landscape” painting or collage.  
- **Movement/Dance**: Explore traditional folk dances from each culture (e.g., square dance steps, Native American circle dances).

✅ **Lesson Alignment Summary**:  
This 30-minute lesson directly addresses **2.CN.1** by guiding students to identify and describe how two American folk songs reflect cultural heritage through lyrics, instruments, and movement. Activities are developmentally appropriate, culturally responsive, and allow for student creativity and expression within tight time constraints. Differentiation ensures accessibility for all learners, and reflection extends learning beyond the classroom.
