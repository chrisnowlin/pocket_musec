    "context": "Skills progress at different levels due to a number of factors, including continuity and quality of instruction; informal exposure to music through community interaction; opportunities to access music programs in K-12 education; student developmental level and ability; motivation and resources available for individual practice; etc.",
    "note_k5": "The K-5 music standards and objectives are written for elementary students who are taught by a licensed music educator for at least 50 minutes per week.",
    "note_6_8": "The grade 6-8 standards and objectives are written for middle school students who are taught by a licensed music educator for at least 90 minutes per week.",
    "note_high_school": "Levels Beginning through Advanced courses for high school credit are intended to develop proficiency in the artform of a students' choice and to support a well-rounded education. These courses meet for as long as other high school courses meet and are also taught by a licensed music educator.",
    "proficiency_organization": "To account for variations in skill progression, as well as to embed multiple entry points across the K-12 spectrum, the objectives in vocal and instrumental music and the high school general music NCSCOS are organized by proficiency level, rather than grade level."
