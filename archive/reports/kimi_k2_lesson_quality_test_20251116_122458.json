Teacher claps a 4-beat rhythm; students echo. Gradually increase complexity.  \n- Ask: *\u201cWhat makes a rhythm memorable? What makes a melody stick in your head?\u201d*  \n- Introduce the lesson: *\u201cToday, you\u2019re going to be composers! You\u2019ll create your own 8-beat musical phrase using rhythm and melody \u2014 just like songwriters do!\u201d*\n\n**Connection to Prior Learning**:  \n- Briefly review:  \n  - Rhythm values: quarter note = 1 beat, eighth note = \u00bd beat, rest = silence  \n  - C pentatonic scale: C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013G\u2013A (no sharps/flats \u2014 easy to improvise with)  \n- Show a simple 4-beat rhythm and melody example on the board. Clap/sing it together.\n\n---\n\n### Main Activities (30 minutes)\n\n#### Activity 1: Rhythmic Composition (8 minutes)  \n- Students work in pairs or small groups.  \n- Each group creates a 4-beat rhythmic pattern using:  \n  - At least 1 quarter note  \n  - At least 1 eighth note pair  \n  - At least 1 rest  \n- Encourage experimentation with dynamics (loud/soft) and articulation (staccato/legato).  \n- Groups practice performing their rhythm with body percussion or unpitched instruments.  \n- **Teacher Tip**: Walk around and provide feedback: *\u201cTry adding a rest to create space!\u201d* or *\u201cCan you make that rhythm bouncy?\u201d*\n\n#### Activity 2: Melodic Composition (8 minutes)  \n- Students switch to pitched instruments (xylophones, boomwhackers, etc.).  \n- Using only the C pentatonic scale, students create a 4-beat melodic phrase.  \n- Suggest starting/ending on C for stability.  \n- Encourage repetition or contrast (e.g., same rhythm but different notes, or same notes with different rhythm).  \n- Groups practice playing their melody slowly, then with the metronome set to 80\u2013100 BPM.\n\n#### Activity 3: Combining Rhythm + Melody (8 minutes)  \n- Groups combine their 4-beat rhythm and 4-beat melody into one 8-beat phrase.  \n- Structure: Rhythm first (beats 1\u20134), then melody (beats 5\u20138).  \n- Encourage students to add a dynamic shape (e.g., crescendo or decrescendo) or a fermata at the end.  \n- Practice as a group, ensuring everyone plays their part together.\n\n#### Activity 4: Peer Performance & Feedback (6 minutes)  \n- Each group performs their 8-beat composition for the class.  \n- After each performance, the class gives \u201cTwo Stars and a Wish\u201d feedback:  \n  - Two things they liked (e.g., \u201cI liked the syncopation!\u201d)  \n  - One thing to try next time (e.g., \u201cTry adding a rest in the melody.\u201d)  \n- Teacher models feedback first.\n\n---\n\n### Closure/Reflection (5\u20138 minutes)\n\n**Summary**:  \n- Recap: *\u201cToday we composed rhythms, melodies, and combined them into a musical phrase. You used repetition, contrast, and dynamics \u2014 just like real composers!\u201d*\n\n**Student Reflection**:  \n- Students answer 1\u20132 of the following in writing or verbally:  \n  - *What was the most challenging part of composing?*  \n  - *What did you learn about combining rhythm and melody?*  \n  - *How did your group work together?*\n\n**Connection to Future Learning**:  \n- *\u201cNext week, we\u2019ll add harmony to our compositions using ostinatos \u2014 stay tuned!\u201d*\n\n---\n\n## Assessment Strategies\n\n### Formative Assessment:\n- **Observation**: Teacher circulates during composition time, noting:  \n  - Use of correct rhythm values  \n  - Melodic use of pentatonic scale  \n  - Group collaboration and problem-solving  \n- **Peer Feedback**: \u201cTwo Stars and a Wish\u201d provides immediate, student-centered assessment.  \n- **Performance Checklist** (for teacher use):  \n  - \u2705 Rhythm includes quarter, eighth, and rest  \n  - \u2705 Melody uses only C pentatonic notes  \n  - \u2705 Phrase is 8 beats total  \n  - \u2705 Group performs together with dynamics/articulation  \n\n### Success Criteria Rubric (Simplified for Middle School):\n\n| Criteria                 | Exceeds Expectations | Meets Expectations | Needs Improvement |\n|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------|\n| Rhythm Accuracy          | Uses 3+ note values creatively | Uses required values correctly | Missing required elements |\n| Melody Creativity        | Inventive, clear structure | Uses pentatonic scale appropriately | Limited note choices or errors |\n| Performance Unity        | Group plays together with expression | Group plays together | Timing or coordination issues |\n| Peer Feedback Engagement | Gives specific, helpful feedback | Gives basic feedback | Minimal or no feedback |\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### For Advanced Students:\n- Challenge to add harmony (e.g., a simple ostinato on a drone note like C).  \n- Encourage syncopation or mixed meter (e.g., 3+5 beats instead of 4+4).  \n- Invite them to notate their composition using standard notation or graphic notation.\n\n### For Struggling Students:\n- Provide pre-made rhythm/melody cards to choose from and combine.  \n- Allow use of a single instrument or body percussion only.  \n- Pair with a peer mentor for collaborative composition.  \n- Offer visual aids: rhythm icons, color-coded notes, or a \u201ccomposition template\u201d worksheet.\n\n### For English Language Learners (ELL) or Students with IEPs:\n- Use visual aids and modeling extensively.  \n- Provide sentence stems for peer feedback: *\u201cI liked how you\u2026\u201d*  \n- Allow verbal or pictorial responses for reflection.  \n- Offer extended time or small group support during composition phase.\n\n---\n\n## Reflection and Extension\n\n### Student Reflection Questions:\n1. What part of composing did you enjoy the most? Why?  \n2. How did working in a group help or challenge your creativity?  \n3. If you had more time, what would you change or add to your composition?\n\n### Extension Activities:\n- **Homework**: Record your 8-beat phrase using a phone or tablet and share via Google Classroom.  \n- **Cross-Curricular Connection**: Write a short poem or story that matches the mood of your composition.  \n- **Tech Integration**: Use free apps like Soundtrap or Chrome Music Lab to record and layer compositions [Web Source: https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/].  \n- **Performance Extension**: Combine all group compositions into a class \u201cRhythm & Melody Medley\u201d for a school assembly or parent night.\n\n---\n\n## Citations\n\n[1] North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. \u201cMusic Standard Course of Study.\u201d https://www.dpi.nc.gov/curriculum/music  \n[2] \u201cMetronome Beats \u2014 iOS App.\u201d Apple App Store, https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metronome-beats/id1452302484  \n[3] Chrome Music Lab. \u201cExperiments in Music and Technology.\u201d Google, https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/  \n[4] National Association for Music Education (NAfME). \u201cCreating in the Music Classroom.\u201d https://nafme.org/creating-in-the-music-classroom/  \n\n--- \n\nThis lesson plan is designed to be flexible, engaging, and aligned with middle school developmental needs while fostering creativity, collaboration, and musical literacy.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd Lesson Customization Options\n\nThis lesson plan was created specifically for you based on our conversation!

Today, you\u2019re going to be composers \u2014 you\u2019ll make your own patterns!\u201d\n\n> *Time Allocation*: 8 minutes\n\n---\n\n### Main Activities (25\u201335 minutes)\n\n#### Activity 1: Collaborative Composition (10 minutes)  \n- Students work in groups of 4\u20135.  \n- Each group receives 1 \u201cRhythm Composer\u201d worksheet with 4 empty beat boxes.  \n- Teacher models: \u201cI\u2019m going to make a 4-beat pattern: ta-rest-ti-ti-ta.\u201d  \n- Groups create their own 4-beat pattern using quarter notes, eighth notes, and rests.  \n- Students practice performing their pattern using body percussion (clap, stomp, snap).  \n- Teacher circulates, prompting: \u201cIs your pattern 4 beats? Can you say it using \u2018ta\u2019 and \u2018ti-ti\u2019?\u201d\n\n#### Activity 2: Instrument Transfer & Rehearsal (10 minutes)  \n- Groups choose 1\u20132 instruments to represent their pattern (e.g., drum for \u201cta,\u201d shaker for \u201cti-ti\u201d).  \n- Students rehearse their pattern with instruments, focusing on staying together.  \n- Teacher provides feedback: \u201cAre you all starting together? Is the tempo steady?\u201d  \n- Groups practice performing their pattern 3 times with a steady beat (use metronome if available).\n\n#### Activity 3: Performance Circle (5 minutes)  \n- Each group performs their composition in the \u201cperformance circle.\u201d  \n- Audience students follow along by tapping the beat on their knees.  \n- After each performance, audience gives feedback using sticky notes: \u201cI liked how you used ___!\u201d or \u201cTry adding ___ next time!\u201d\n\n> *Time Allocation*: 25 minutes total (10 + 10 + 5)\n\n---\n\n### Closure/Reflection (5\u201310 minutes)\n\n**Activity: \u201cRhythm Reflection\u201d**  \n- Students return to seats and complete a 3-question reflection on their worksheet:  \n  1. \u201cWhat was your favorite part of creating your rhythm?\u201d  \n  2. \u201cWhat was one thing you learned about working with your group?\u201d  \n  3. \u201cIf you could change one thing about your rhythm, what would it be?\u201d  \n- Teacher invites 2\u20133 volunteers to share responses.  \n- **Connection to Future Learning**: \u201cNext week, we\u2019ll add melody to your rhythms \u2014 imagine your rhythm with a tune!\u201d\n\n> *Time Allocation*: 7 minutes\n\n---\n\n## Assessment Strategies\n\n### Formative Assessment:\n- **Teacher Observation Checklist**:  \n  - [ ] Student can identify and perform quarter/eighth notes and rests  \n  - [ ] Student contributes to group composition  \n  - [ ] Student transfers pattern accurately to instrument  \n  - [ ] Student performs with steady beat and ensemble awareness  \n\n- **Peer Feedback Rubric**:  \n  Students use a visual 3-point scale to rate peer performances:  \n  - **Rhythm Accuracy** (Did it match the pattern?)  \n  - **Creativity** (Did it include interesting rhythms?)  \n  - **Teamwork** (Did everyone participate and stay together?)\n\n### Success Criteria:\n- Students create and perform a 4-beat pattern with at least 2 different note values (e.g., quarter + eighth).  \n- Students demonstrate ensemble awareness (starting/stopping together, steady tempo).  \n- Students provide at least 1 specific piece of feedback to a peer.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### For Advanced Learners:\n- Challenge students to add dynamics (loud/soft) or a 2-measure pattern.  \n- Allow them to create a \u201ccall-and-response\u201d pattern with another group.  \n- Invite them to lead their group\u2019s rehearsal or teach the pattern to another group.\n\n### For Struggling Learners:\n- Provide pre-made rhythm cards to arrange into patterns.  \n- Pair with a peer buddy for collaborative composition.  \n- Use color-coded rhythm symbols (red = quarter, blue = eighth, green = rest).  \n- Allow use of a \u201cbeat keeper\u201d (metronome or teacher\u2019s steady clapping) during performance.\n\n### For ELL/Students with IEPs:\n- Use visual rhythm icons and gestures (e.g., hand motions for \u201cta\u201d and \u201cti-ti\u201d).  \n- Provide sentence starters for reflection: \u201cMy favorite part was ___ because ___.\u201d  \n- Allow verbal or drawn responses instead of written reflection.\n\n---\n\n## Reflection and Extension\n\n### Student Reflection Questions:\n1. \u201cWhat did you learn about creating music with others?\u201d  \n2. \u201cHow did your group solve problems when your rhythm didn\u2019t sound right?\u201d  \n3. \u201cWhat rhythm symbol did you use the most? Why?\u201d\n\n### Extension Activities:\n- **Homework**: \u201cCreate a 4-beat rhythm at home using kitchen utensils. Record or draw it to share next class.\u201d  \n- **Cross-Curricular Connection**: Math \u2014 Students count beats and fractions (e.g., \u201cA quarter note = 1 beat, an eighth note = \u00bd beat\u201d).  \n- **Art Integration**: Students draw a \u201crhythm monster\u201d that represents their pattern using shapes for notes and rests.  \n- **Technology Extension**: Use free apps like *Chrome Music Lab*\u2019s Rhythm Maker to recreate their pattern digitally [Web Source: https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Rhythm/].\n\n---\n\n## Citations\n\n1.
