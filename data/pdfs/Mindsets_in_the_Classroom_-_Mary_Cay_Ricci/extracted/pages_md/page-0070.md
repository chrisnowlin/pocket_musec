opportunities are built in where students can reflect and make adjustments or changes so that they learn from the situation.

One way teachers can help students reflect on failure is to introduce them to a more positive outlook on failure, perhaps by sharing others’ attitudes toward failure. For example, cognitive psychologist Jerome Bruner (1961) hit the nail on the head when he framed failure in this way: “Experience success and failure not as a reward and punishment, but as information.” (p. 61). Or as a more contemporary figure, Michael Jordan, summed up failure in a 1997 Nike commercial: “I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot … and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”

Other learning tasks for helping students learn to deal with and accept failure and mistakes can be found in Chapter 8.
