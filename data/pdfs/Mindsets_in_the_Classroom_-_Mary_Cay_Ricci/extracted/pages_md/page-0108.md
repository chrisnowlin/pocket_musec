2. Learning Experience #2: Road Map. Make an analogy to destinations and roads to explain the connection between neurons and the brain. For example, draw a picture of the school on the board, then ask students how they might get from the school to their home, to the store, to a gas station, and so on. Then show how they can move from that location to another one. Each location (neuron) has a connection or path to another destination. You can use the map in Figure 19 to help you demonstrate this to your class. Tell students,

> “Some have connections to a lot of different locations and others are weaker because you don’t travel to that particular destination often. When you learn a new route, or a new road is built, this makes new connections. Neurons work in a similar way. They make hundreds of connections. The more you learn, the more connections are made. The more they are traveled, the stronger the learning.”
