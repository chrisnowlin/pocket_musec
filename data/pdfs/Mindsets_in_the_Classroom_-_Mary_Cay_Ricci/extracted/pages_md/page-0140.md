## SAMPLE TRAINING PLAN FOR STAFF GROWTH MINDSET PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

### Outcomes
By the end of the professional development participants will be able to:
1. Define the fixed and growth mindset theories.
2. Discuss the research of Dr. Carol Dweck’s work on Mindset theory.  
   Dr. Dweck asserts that intelligence is a malleable quality, a potential that can be developed.
3. Reflect on their own “mindset” about student learning, intelligence, and effort.
4. Explore how student praise and feedback influences student’s mindset
5. Explore ways to teach students about the brain and how they learn
6. Plan for next steps in building a growth mindset class culture.

### Pre-Professional Development Planning
At each table have a folder with copies of the PowerPoint or Flipchart, “My beliefs about intelligence” paper, envelopes for each participant, and the *Mindsets and Equitable Education* (Dweck, 2010) article. In addition, set up four stations with anchor activity folders with alternate articles about growth and fixed mindsets.
