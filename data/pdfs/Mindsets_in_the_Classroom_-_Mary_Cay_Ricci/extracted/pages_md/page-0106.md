they are faced with a challenge. Remind them, “Once you build a strong connection, you have added density to your brain and actually made yourself smarter!”

- You may also ask students to draw their strong and weak or “not yet” neural connections. Draw a rough shape of the brain on a piece of paper and ask students to think about things they understand and are very good at as well as things that they are just learning, but “not yet” understanding fully. Figures 17 and 18 share few examples of Grade 1 students’ neural connections. Take a look at Figure 17. Kamaren’s brain shows very strong neural connections for math, spelling, and riding his dirt bike. He explained however, that his strongest connection is “bugging my mother”—he felt he was very good at that!
