- “her. I need to be more patient when things are difficult for her.”
- “I need to really evaluate the way I praise my children. I need to have more self-controlled thinking before I speak. I am very proud of the efforts of all of my children but I am not sure they know it right now.”

Gathering written feedback from parents after a growth mindset information session will give you data that will help inform your next session. A half sheet of paper with two simple statements (“As a result of this session, I am thinking …” and “As a result of this session, I am planning …”) can provide a lot of meaningful information. You could also have parents take on a task similar to the one given to teachers in professional development sessions (see Chapter 2). Have them write down what they believe about intelligence before the workshop, then have them compare their answers after the workshop’s conclusion. They can then apply what they’ve learned to how they might change their approaches when talking with their children.

Providing information to parents about the importance of effort and persistence should be ongoing. Students can also be charged with interviewing their parents about their beliefs regarding intelligence. Children may, in fact, be the catalysts for helping their parents truly understand the malleability of the mind.
