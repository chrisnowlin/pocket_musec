free, high-definition science education videos. A video about neurons and their connections can also be accessed through School Wax TV ([http://www.schoolwaxtv.com/search/node/neurons](http://www.schoolwaxtv.com/search/node/neurons)). Another good resource is the website Neuroscience for Kids, which is maintained by Eric H. Chudler and was created with the support of a Science Education Partnership Award from the National Center for Research Resources. The site can be found at [http://www.faculty.washington.edu/chudler/neurok.html](http://www.faculty.washington.edu/chudler/neurok.html).

The older the students are, the more details can be added about learning and the brain. For example, once students have an understanding of neural connections, more details can be added. An introduction of dendrites and synapses would be a logical next step. A dendrite is a branch-like projection off of a neuron that receives incoming messages from other nerve cells. A synapse allows a neuron to pass a signal to another neuron. After a discussion or demonstration about creating neural pathways, ask students to complete a formative assessment in order to help you gauge their understanding. Simply give each child a blank piece of paper and ask the students to draw or write about all of the things they learned about the brain. Teachers should provide and review formative assessments to check for understanding. If necessary, work with students who have not conceptualized the idea of the connections of neurons and approach the instruction in a new way.

**Sample Learning Task #3: The Brain Is Like a Muscle**

“What? You mean I can exercise my brain like a muscle?”—Grade 7 student

Explain to the students that the brain is like a muscle—the more you use it, the stronger it gets. This is usually an easy concept for students to gain, especially when you use a demonstration process like the following:

- Show students a 2-pound hand weight. (Older students may want to use a 5-pound weight.) Ask a student to demonstrate how someone might use this weight to exercise. Ask the following question: “If I ask
