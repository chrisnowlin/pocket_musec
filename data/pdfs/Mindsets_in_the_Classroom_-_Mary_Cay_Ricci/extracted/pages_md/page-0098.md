will demonstrate little to no understanding. I’ve had students respond simply with “My brain helps me think” coupled with a drawing of some scribbles or a spaghetti-like mass. Keep in mind that the purpose of a preassessment is so that you can match students’ instruction to their needs —how will you know which students fall in the category of knowing much about their brain and which ones need more instruction without ever administering the preassessment? It’s never a waste of time!

For example, through this process, many students have surfaced in all grade levels that show some understanding of brain function. Take a look at Vierra’s brain preassessment in Figure 11.
