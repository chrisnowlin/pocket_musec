# Elementary Preassessment

Teachers should explain to the students that they would like to find out what the students already know about the brain and how it functions. For example, you could say, “I am going to give you a paper, and I would like for you to do two things.” Hold up a copy of the blank preassessment for the brain (see Figure 7) and ask the students, “Who can tell me what shape these dots are forming?” (expect answers such as head or face).
