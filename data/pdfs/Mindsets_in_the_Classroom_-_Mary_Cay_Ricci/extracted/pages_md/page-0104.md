> “If work gets hard, I just imagine neurons in my brain trying to connect.”—Grade 5 student

Several ideas are provided below to help students build a conceptual understanding of what happens in the brain when they learn. These explanations also help students visualize the neural connections that are made and strengthened with learning, practice, and mastery.

Before you share these learning experiences, give students some background on how the brain works, telling them, “Inside the brain we all have brain cells called *neurons*. We have billions of neurons, some connect to each other and some are just sort of floating around.” Show them a picture or diagram of a neuron, like the one in **Figure 14**. Ask students to think about what might cause these neurons to connect with each other. Here are a few sample learning experiences that can help you teach students this concept:
