- *Use questions for students to respond to in writing.* Provide students with a few questions that will help them communicate their understanding of a concept.
- *Use exit cards.* Provide a prompt on an exit card that each student fills out at the end of an instructional experience. It might be a math problem, a sentence that needs grammar corrections, a question about why or how an historical event came to be, or a statement asking for a summary of the content learned.
- *Use a 3-2-1.* A 3-2-1 can be customized depending on the content and grade level. A generic form of a 3-2-1 might provide students an opportunity to express orally or in writing the following: 3 Things I Learned Today, 2 Things I Have Questions About, 1 Thing That I Want to Learn More About. See Figure 3 for an example of a 3-2-1.
- *Listen to and observe students.* Observing students during a science lab, working a math problem, or completing an in-class writing assignment or listening to them discussing a novel can also serve as a formative assessment.
