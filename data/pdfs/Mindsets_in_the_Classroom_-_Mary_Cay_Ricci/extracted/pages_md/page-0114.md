The common concept that is being formed is “things that are good for your brain” such as sleep, exercise, brain foods, water (hydration), reading, and learning. After the collection is complete, debrief the process of the collection by asking students, “After I took out each object, what were you thinking/what was your brain doing?” Let students know that they just exercised their brains and made it stronger by coming up with all of these ideas (point to category cards). Explain to the students that it does not matter if an idea was the same as the teacher’s; they made their brain stronger just by thinking about the connections among the items in the collection!

Review with the students all of the different ways that we can help ourselves become smarter (point to the collection). Tell them, “It is important to always believe that if we try hard, our brain can grow.” Discuss the meaning of the word effort and ask students to share specific examples of the ways that they put forth effort.

## Introducing Growth Mindset Terminology

After completing some or all of the preliminary lessons to build students’ knowledge of how their brains work, you’re ready to introduce them to the ideas behind what makes a growth mindset. Explain to the students that if we always believe that with effort and persistence we can learn and become smarter, then we will have a growth mindset. Show students the Growth Mindset Poster found in Figure 20.
