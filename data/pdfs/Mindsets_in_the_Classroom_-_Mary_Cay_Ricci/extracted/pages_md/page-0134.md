many professional development sessions to teachers, parents, and administrators on the topic. It was after one of these sessions that I was approached by a participant who suggested that I write a book about the educational implications of growth and fixed mindsets. She shared that she thought I had a lot to offer educators and had the potential to have a positive impact on children. I thanked her for the nice complement and, well, I hate to admit it, but a fixed mindset mentality sprang right back into my head and I thought, “I could never write a book.” About a month later, I heard Carol Dweck speak at the National Association for Gifted Children conference and on the plane ride home, I began this book. This process has not been easy, yes, there were times when I considered giving up (especially when my editor sent back my first revisions—thanks, Lacy) but I persevered. As I write these last few lines, I notice that the laundry needs done, I need to prepare for a presentation tomorrow, the dog needs to be taken out, and my daughter is asking for homework help. Juggling family, a new job, and writing has been one of the greatest challenges of my life, but I did it … with lots of hard work and effort. Both you and your students can do whatever you set out to do, too!
