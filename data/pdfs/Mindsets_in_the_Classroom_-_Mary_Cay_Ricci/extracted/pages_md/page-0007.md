# Dedication

For my children—Christopher, Patrick, and Isabella. You continue to inspire me. May you always believe that with effort and perseverance you can do anything.

For my parents—Joe and Mary Ellen Marchione. Thank you for believing in me.

For Enio—Thank you for your support and patience. For the people in my professional life who saw things in me that I did not see in myself—Ginny, Carl, and Monique.
