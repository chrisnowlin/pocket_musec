- “Thinking and working hard became a ‘mindset’ in my classroom. We all worked together, learned from our mistakes, and challenged our brains to grow. The students have become really good at believing in themselves.”

Critical thinking and a growth mindset culture go hand in hand. We can expect students to embrace challenge only if we make it available to them on a consistent basis.
