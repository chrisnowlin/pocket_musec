After the students have completed the preassessments, review them, looking for patterns of responses. Common responses include:
- “My brain helps me think.”
- “My brain makes me smart.”

Also analyze the students’ drawings of the brain: Is the size accurate? Make generalizations about the student’s baseline knowledge about the brain. Make note of any student(s) who seem to have more than basic knowledge about the brain and plan for differentiation for these students (such as the completed assessments for Mike, Devin, and Alana in Figures 8–10). Other students will have some knowledge of their brains but need more information about how the brain works. Some will simply be starting at square one and need much more instruction.
