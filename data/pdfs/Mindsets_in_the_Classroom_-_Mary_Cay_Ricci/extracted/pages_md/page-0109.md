3. Learning Experience #3: Visualization. Ask students to visualize walking through an unexplored forest. You can use this script as you walk them through their visualization session:

> “There are no paths, no plants that have been trampled on, nothing to lead the way. A new neural pathway is like walking through an unexplored forest for the first time. The more frequently the path is used, the fewer the barriers and obstacles that stand in the way. Eventually a clear path is created. That clear path represents a clear understanding of the content being taught.”

4. Learning Experience #4: Use manipulatives. Elementary classrooms can order plushy neurons from http://www.giantmicrobes.com. These cute “brain cells” can be used to demonstrate neural connections that are made during learning. Primary students particularly like demonstrating brain activity using these furry brain cells. Kindergarten students can also join hands to demonstrate neural connections.

5. Learning Experience #5: Use Technology to Show Students’ Neurons in Action. Many videos exist online that demonstrate neural connections. The Cassiopeia Project (http://www.cassiopeiaproject.com) provides
