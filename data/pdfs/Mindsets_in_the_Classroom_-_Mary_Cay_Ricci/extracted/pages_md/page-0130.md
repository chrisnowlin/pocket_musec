On one visit to Maryvale, teachers were asked to look carefully at their curriculum and identify places where they could embed the growth mindset message. This exercise allowed for this staff to take ownership of the message—they looked at curriculum in a new way, through the lens of opportunities to nurture persistence, effort, intellectual risk taking, and perseverance. Figure 25 shows an example of how the staff looked at their current curricula and thought about ways the concept of growth mindset could be incorporated.
