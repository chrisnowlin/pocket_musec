Draw a picture of what you think your brain looks like.

Write down or ask your teacher to write anything that you know about your brain.

Distribute the preassessment found in Figure 7. Ask students to draw a picture of what they think their brains might look like inside the blank outline of the head. Then, students should write down anything that they know about their brain. Remind students that this is not for a grade, but just to gauge their knowledge.
