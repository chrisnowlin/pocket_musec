| 4 | FREEZE! We have completed this task. It is time to move on. |
| 3 | Complete your thought. Clean up your space. |
| 2 | TRANSITION! |
| 1 | Let us get ready to move to our new space! |

When implementing this procedure in the beginning, students may need additional time for each step. For instance, you will display the number four for about fifteen seconds. Let everyone know to FREEZE! Then, display the number three, letting them know to complete their thought. They can also start cleaning up their spaces. As the students begin to do this routine consistently, it will require less and less time in between each step.

## Procedure for When There is a Substitute

Of all the things I had to plan for as a teacher, planning for a substitute was what I liked the least. I disliked it so much that it was not even worth it to take off. But then, here comes the day where you can hardly get out of bed. Therefore, you must take a sick day. In that moment, you have to think about how you are going to get information to a substitute. How will they know what to do with your class? If you do not have a pre-existing plan for a substitute, then most likely planning for your substitute will fall on your colleagues, who will not be happy about it! Like most teachers, they will also shun having to plan for a substitute, especially if it is not their substitute. You know your students, but more importantly, you know what they need. So, the best thing to do is plan, plan, plan!
