# Introduction

I know what you are thinking... How hard could it be? I mean, really: how difficult could it be to manage a classroom? They are just children. They are just kids. So, why all the fuss? What is with all the classroom management talk? Sit here. Sit there. Raise your hand. Get in line. Walk in the hall. Go to lunch. Go to the bathroom. Now, let us move to centers.

Kids can do all this without a problem BUT let me ask you a question: What will you do when transitions do not flow so efficiently?

Of course students can do all that! They can do it all. The goal, therefore, is to get dozens of kids to accomplish a task all at once and without incident, while taking ownership of their own accountability and behavior. Nevertheless, how do we get multiple little humans to transition in the classroom, outside of the classroom, to the bathroom, to lunch, out to recess, engaged in teaching, and back to the restroom ALL WHILE SAVING THE TOILET PAPER!

Well...

Every day, educators all over the world manage to move little humans throughout the school building by using established routines and procedures. Classroom management is the foundation on which everything in your class is built. Every transition, restroom break, and lesson which is delivered, will only be as effective as your established procedures. If you can think of it, there should be a procedure for it!
