Remember: This procedure may look different at your school site. Your school administrator may use a different sign or signal. However, confirming students are safe and accounted for during a fire drill should be the goal in any school.

One thing I learned early on which helped me during safety drills was to get a backpack. I kept it by the front door at all times and it contained these items:

- An updated classroom roster.
- Kleenex, just in case.
- Your “all clear” and “not clear” signs to hold up stating whether all your students are present or if you are missing any.

The same bag can be used for tornado drills and any other security drill that require students to leave the classroom and transition to other places. You will always have to account for students at all times, both inside and outside of your classroom.

Security drills vary from campus to campus. So, it is best to ask your administrator about security drills. Some drills require students to remain inside the classroom with the lights off, remaining quiet. Other security drills require teachers to continue teaching, but they are to close and lock their classroom doors. These drills make it easier to account for students, while still requiring to have a procedure in place. Always practice the procedure before show time!
