### The Orange Teacher

- Spontaneous teacher. He or she can, and probably will, change the lesson in the middle of instruction.
- Flexible.
- Non-traditional.
- Brings innovation and creativity into the classroom.
- Big picture thinker; not about details.

### The Orange Student
- Learns by doing.
- Needs hands-on experiences.
- Limits routine and structure, but instead focuses on giving students freedom and “real world” learning experiences.
- Needs instant gratification, so incorporate competitive games that will have instant outcomes.
- These are the students whom other group members do not think they are taking learning serious. Still, they need time for independent study opportunities.
