Where do my eyes go?
Where do my hands go?
What is my mouth doing?
What is my body doing?
Where do my feet go?

This activity can be done as a class, helping students learn to establish carpet procedures. Display the first chart. As a class, discuss what Otis’ eyes should be doing. What is his mouth doing? Where should his feet and hands go? What is his body doing?

Next, use the blank template to write down your student’s answers. What do they say their class should be doing? Display this chart where carpet time takes place. This way, it is visible as you review the expectations. The students will have ownership if it is completed as a class.

Once students are seated on the carpet, review the carpet expectations.

We all have the typical “rules” of keep all hands, feet, and objects to yourself, which tell students what not to do. Conversely, our expectations tell students what to do. I was guilty of this as a new teacher, and most of the time, I would spend hours telling students what not to do or to stop doing something. When that happened, the focus was never on the expectation but rather on the unwanted behavior. Using a template like this will help the teacher reiterate the expected behavior with the students while everyone is on the carpet in small groups.
