phone conference. The goal is to touch base with the other co-parent, discussing the child’s progress and/or areas of improvement. You need them and they need you to help the child succeed.

A parent/teacher conference typically lasts between ten to fifteen minutes. It can be broken down such as:

- **One to two minutes** – Introduce yourself. Describe how much you enjoy their child being in your class.
- **Two minutes** – Always start with positive data, such as how much their child has grown in a particular area.
- **Five minutes** – Discuss progress reports, academic data, attendance data, and behavior data (if necessary). Discuss the next steps.
- **Three minutes** – Address any questions/concerns which the parent/guardian may have.
- **Two minutes** – Update any contact information from the parent/guardian, if needed.

Take good notes. Be sure to follow up with parents after the conference, answering any follow up questions or providing materials, if needed. Have ongoing communication with parents well after the conference.
