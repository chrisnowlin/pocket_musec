# Procedure for Tardy Students

Students are considered tardy when they arrive in your classroom after school has started and more than likely, you have already initiated your daily routine. Therefore, instruction is now underway. Breaking an instructional flow to get materials for tardy students would also break engagement. This has to be avoided. There is not enough time in the school day, and every minute must be protected. Consequently, establishing a set routine and procedure for tardy students helps continue the instructional flow. Below you will find some suggestions to assist in implementing this procedure:

- This can be a job for the class leader! Remember your True Colors Personality Test. Assign this role to those students needing a leadership position in the classroom. The student leader can be responsible for ensuring the tardy student is caught up on what is happening.
- Write directions that are visible for students coming in late. This allows them to see the expectation rather than asking you.
- Have materials ready and accessible for students at all times.
