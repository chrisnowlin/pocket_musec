example, we must review expectations for getting the day started before the students start their day. Review carpet time expectations before students go to the carpet; and review restroom break procedures before the students walk into the restroom. In addition, we must make sure students know and understand the expectation. You cannot hold students accountable for not adhering to the expectation if you have not been clear in stating the expectation.
