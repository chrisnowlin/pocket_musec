morning meeting’s routines and procedures. During the sharing phase, students discuss their thoughts, feelings, and/or responses toward a topic. They may also defend their responses. Allowing students to defend their position is a good way to build conative skills. It helps students determine how other students will respond when there is a disagreement.

**Group Activity** - The whole-class activity is the meat of the morning meeting. What will be the focus for the day? The meeting should scaffold from one to the other. In this way, the recap should lead into the whole-group activity.

**Closing** - Reinforce the intended purpose for the day’s morning meeting, as well as its reflection time. Allow students to discuss their takeaways and the day’s goals. Before the teacher releases the students, review expectations for transitioning to their next classroom activity.
