groups created a predictable frustration, because I did not think the students would come back together after interacting as collaborative groups. If I am being really honest, I thought they would be talking about things unrelated to school and content. As far as classroom jobs, it was best if I did it all myself. Therefore, I avoided potential arguments, fighting, and inequity of job assignments.
