- Teacher assistants can assist the teacher in handing out snacks to the class.

If your procedure involves only handing out snacks after students have put away their supplies and cleaned up their areas, then stick to that.

**Remember:** If it is not okay at any time, then it should not be okay anytime. When you establish a procedure, it is important that you uphold your own procedure. Students will only take a procedure as seriously as you do.
