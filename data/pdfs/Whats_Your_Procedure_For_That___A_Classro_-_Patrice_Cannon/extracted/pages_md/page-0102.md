This procedure should involve students having a pass in order to transition to another place in the building. One way to ensure the student actually went to the place they were directed to report is by having the receiving party initial and/or time stamp the pass. They can also call you.

Another way involves having sign in and sign out forms for older students. Therefore, they can sign out to go where they are going with the time and sign back in upon their return. This helps with documentation. It allows you to see how many times a student leaves your class and for how long, just in case there is a need to meet with a care taker or administrator.
