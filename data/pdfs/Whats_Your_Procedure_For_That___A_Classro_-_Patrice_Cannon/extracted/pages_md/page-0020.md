- Knowledgeable in the content that they are teaching.

- Use higher-order thinking skills.

### The Green Student

- Needs rewards and appreciation for their thinking and innovative ideas.
- Needs to know the “why” just as much as the “what.”

| “I am serious about learning. Sometimes I think you do not think I am.”<br>“If you make learning active and hands-on, I will be more engaged.”<br>“How is there more than one answer?” | “I am having a hard time dealing with the disorganization.”<br>“What is the procedure for asking/answering questions?”<br>“Can you write down what you are saying so I can put it in my journal?” | “I do not feel comfortable disagreeing with someone’s claim.”<br>“Having a relationship with you is just as important as the content.”<br>“I need more opportunities for group work.” | “I understand this teacher.”<br>“We should always have to defend our responses.”<br>“I like that you give me ownership and independence in my learning.” |
