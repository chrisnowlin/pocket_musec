bringing unwanted behavior to the student’s attention and informing them of the desired conduct or expectation. Next, give them a chance to make the adjustment. Once the behavior is improved, compliment the student and move forward. Harping on a student’s mishaps seldom causes children to revise it. Instead, it embarrasses students, creates resentment, and breeds more unwanted actions. The end result is that you now have a student in your class who does not feel safe with you.

**Giving step-by-step instructions is another way to implement this procedure in the classroom. These include:**  
When I call your name (or use another identifying characteristic: shirt color, shoe color, etc.), stand up.

- Push in your chair.
- Walk quietly to the line. (If they do not, make them go back and try it again.)
- Keep your hands, legs, and objects to yourself.
- Stand quietly in line.

Do not leave the classroom until students have met the expectation. However, if there is one student refusing to fulfill the classroom expectation, allow the other students to transition. Handle that isolated issue afterwards. Punishing all students for one student’s behavior will frustrate those who are fulfilling the expectation.  
After all, what is the purpose of doing what is expected if it does not matter?
