quick emotional assessment of your students. As students enter the classroom and put their things away, they can fill this out on a piece of paper. Try to keep the evaluation as confidential as possible. Students are less likely to be honest in front of their friends. This activity may not be for every student; however, it will work for some kids. Better yet, it could be the difference for just one kid.

Another way to incorporate this chart is by cutting out the pictures. Have the lower grades circle how they feel.

Schedule some time during the day to review the charts as early as possible. This addresses any underlining issues, instead of allowing the student to sit in distress for a long period of time. This could help a student reset his or her day.

# How do you feel today?

What I want my teacher to know...

Older students may use this form to explain how they are feeling.

Younger students may require pictures, making it easier to verbalize any issues with you in private.
