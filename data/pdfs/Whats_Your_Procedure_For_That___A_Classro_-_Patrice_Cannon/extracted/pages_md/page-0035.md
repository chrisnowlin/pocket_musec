At the beginning of the school year, review each category with your students. Model what they should do. Instruct students to circle or express the first emotion they feel. This activity can further help students monitor their feelings and develop coping skills. It is okay to express when they feel better.

It will be important to establish solid procedures and routines, so explain the expectation well. Establish the expectation that students should avoid any type of muddling with other student’s papers or there will be a consequence. Be serious about this. In turn, it will eliminate any potential for students not taking this seriously when or if things get out of control.

**Remember:** Children need to feel safe, which includes being permitted to freely express themselves without aftermaths. Be intentional about protecting discretion in the classroom, because it could be all the difference to one child.
