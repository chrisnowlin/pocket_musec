Once students are on the carpet, take time to review the expectation. Practice it with the students. It is okay to go ahead and teach your carpet lesson, since it continues to set the expectation during a read aloud, reading or math wall time, etc.

Think back to the car ride. The first twenty to thirty minutes were perfectly fine, but the irritable triggers did not happen until further down the road. Well, the same occurs with carpet time. Try to limit carpet time to twenty to thirty minutes. Putting students in close proximity for long periods of time is setting yourself up for a stressful day.

The layout on the next page will assist teachers with establishing carpet time expectations. We cannot assume students come with conative skills, so they must be taught. Telling students to keep their hands, feet, and/or objects to themselves is a start, but it must be followed up with teaching students what to do with their hands, feet, and objects.
