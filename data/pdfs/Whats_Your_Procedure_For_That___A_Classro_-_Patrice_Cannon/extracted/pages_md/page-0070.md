If you are not moving onto a new academic standard and building on the current one, students may complete a prediction map instead.

A prediction map allows students to make predictions about what is coming next during the learning phase. The teacher examines the student's thinking, while being intentional about how to adjust teaching. This will help with intentional lesson planning, questioning strategies, and how to plan for evidence.

Students taking a little more time to finish the temperature check can complete their KWL chart or prediction map during center time. Alternatively, they can choose another time in class when they are finished working on a different assignment. Neither the KWL chart nor the prediction map should be used for grades. It is just a way for students to examine their own thinking, while possibly revising this thinking after learning takes place. Furthermore, it allows the teacher to see how the student is thinking in reference to the learning target.

Before introducing the next lesson, these can be reviewed as a class. This way, those that did not have a chance to complete one can still be a part of the conversation.
