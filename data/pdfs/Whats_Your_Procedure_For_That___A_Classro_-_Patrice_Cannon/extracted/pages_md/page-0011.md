styles, labeling them with colors. This model of categorizing personalities is based on the work of Isabel Briggs-Myers, Katherine Briggs, and David Keirey. Don Lowry developed the True Colors System, which uses four distinct colors (orange, gold, green and blue) to designate personality types and behavioral styles.  
Lowry’s objective was to understand how personality styles can be used, thereby initiating better communication and understanding between people within a multitude of places. Moreover, he anticipated for it to lead to positive self-worth and self-esteem. The belief is that, with an increased understanding of ourselves and others, conflicts will decrease. You must first learn your personality color, so that you can understand personality colors of your students and/or colleagues. Only then will you have a better understanding of how you and they behave.  
Everyone has some degree of each color, but one color is predominant. The following online quiz is designed to identify your spectrum. It can be found online at: https://truecolorsintl.com/personality-assessment/ . Follow the directions carefully, transferring your scores to the next section in this book. If you have two colors which have the same score, pick a color you think more accurately describes you, or choose a color to which you are drawn.
