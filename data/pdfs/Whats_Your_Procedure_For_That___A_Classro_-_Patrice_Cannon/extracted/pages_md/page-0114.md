**Remember:** The brain remembers everything. Correcting behavior can be challenging. Be careful not to try to regain power by making someone else feel powerless. That can ultimately create emotional and mental damage which impacts a child long after he or she leaves your classroom. Being the adult already gives you power. Use it wisely. Never allow a position of power blind you from a position of purpose.
