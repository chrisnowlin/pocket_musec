### THE PROBLEM: TEACHERS START THE YEAR WITH "NO"

Ah, yes—the first day of class. That special time of the year when everything starts fresh. New students. New ideas. New opportunities. And the same old first day routine. If you are like many teachers, the first day of class, whether it be the beginning of the year, a quarter, or a semester, is often spent going through introductions, expectations, and rules. And while the introductions generally start things off on the right foot, momentum begins to slip a bit once you start talking about expectations. And by the time you hit the rules, well, that’s where the “no” rainstorm really opens up.

- No chewing gum.
- No eating or drinking in class.
