decrease this stress by allowing students to work with people they are comfortable with, the result will be a more productive use of class time for everyone involved (including you).

**Allow for student choice on assignments and tests.** Instead of having one option for an assignment or a test, provide students with a variety of options where they can show their understanding of the subject. The end goal is that your students reach the learning target set for them, and the best way to help them accomplish this is to allow them to connect their learning to something that is of interest and meaningful to them. Possible options for this are:

1. **Provide students with a variety of options as a way for them to showcase their learning.** Instead of a traditional final exam, I often provide a written option (i.e., writing a paper about the learning), an artistic option (i.e., drawing a visual representation of the learning), or a technological option (i.e., making a movie about the learning). Providing students with a range of choices gives them the chance to express what they learned in a way that offers them a voice in the process. This simple act will help students become more engaged in the learning, thus creating fewer opportunities for classroom distractions. (See Act 6: Final Project Options.)
