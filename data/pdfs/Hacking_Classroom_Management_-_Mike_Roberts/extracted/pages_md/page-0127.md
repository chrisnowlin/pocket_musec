**THE PROBLEM: TEACHERS ARE AFRAID TO HAVE FUN WITH THEIR CLASS**

I’m not really sure when it happened, but somewhere along the line, fun transformed itself into a concept that is often frowned upon in the classroom. It’s like it has somehow become that other “F” word, and some teachers and administrators forbid its use within the walls of their schools. Students at every grade and in every subject are often denied the chance to, well, be kids at school. While the reasons themselves vary (high-stakes testing, overcrowded classrooms, scripted curriculums), the results don’t. School is often a very boring place.
