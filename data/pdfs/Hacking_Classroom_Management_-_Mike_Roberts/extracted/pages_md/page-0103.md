potential. Sure, we use it to confirm meetings, read agendas, and post announcements. We also tend to break it out when a student fails a test, throws an item across the room, or makes inappropriate comments in class.

But how often do we use it to *improve* our classroom atmosphere? There are many ways to use email to strengthen the classroom environment, each with its own benefit. The three examples listed below allow you to start the year on a positive note, solidify it as the year progresses, and finish the year on an upward trajectory.

**Beginning-of-the-year emails.** At the beginning of the year, send an email to parents, introduce yourself, and ask them to send you five little-known facts about their child. As you begin to receive these, read them aloud to the class, but do so without using the child’s name or gender. After reading each one, have the class try to guess who the email is about. Read two per day until all the emails have been read. (See Act 8: Parent Email.)
