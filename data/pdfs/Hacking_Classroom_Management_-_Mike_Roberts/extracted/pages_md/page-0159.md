# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

While it might be my name on the cover of this book, there are a ton of people who helped make this book a reality. First, I’d like to acknowledge all the teachers and students who were so willing to share their experiences and thoughts with me. It is their insight that brings the essence of this book to life. Next, I’d like to thank my mom and my kids for everything they have added to my life over the years. Third, a special shout-out goes to Sarah, my biggest supporter, who has always been there to help me hammer out a sentence or offer up a suggestion. Along those same lines, I would be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge my appreciation to Mark Barnes (and the entire Hack Learning team) for taking a chance on a middle school English teacher. And finally to my grandma, for always pushing me to do a better job today than I did yesterday.
