2. Have students pair up and stand side-by-side in two parallel lines. Each group should be separated by about two feet.

3. Ask the first question, then have the group slowly start walking as they discuss the topic. As they walk, you are walking up and down the line, listening to the conversations to make sure students are touching on essential information.

4. After one or two minutes (depending on the depth of the question), have the students wrap up their comments. Again, for the sake of classroom management, it’s better to have students exit each question a few seconds too early than to let them go one second too long. As an added bonus, the question is officially ended once the students have thanked their partners and shaken hands. I always end each question this way so students can actively engage in the positive standards I expect from them.

5. Before asking the next question, have the students in the left line move one position forward (with the front going to the back). Students then greet their new partners (again with a handshake), followed by you providing the next question.

6. Repeat until you have covered the topic.

Like musical chairs, the timing of this one depends on the number of questions. From my experience, a solid walk-n-talk will take twenty to thirty minutes to fully implement (leave class, walk, return
