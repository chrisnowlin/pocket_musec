| "You must sit in your assigned seat..." | "Pick a seat where you will be the most productive with your time." |
| "You have to ask permission in order to go to the bathroom..." | "If you have to go to the bathroom, just autograph the sign-out sheet so I know where you are." |
| "Everyone is expected to participate, so be ready to be called on at any time..." | "The expectation is that everyone participates, so make sure you jump in when you have something good to say." |
| "No swearing or bad language..." | "Have a little class when you speak." |
| "I will wait for your attention..." | "Ladies and gentleman, can I please have your attention?" |
| "No cell phones..." | "You have your phones with you all day, and you only get to see me for an hour. Plus, they will only distract you from all the awesome stuff we are going to be doing." |
| "No cheating..." | "Trust me, your integrity isn’t worth a point or two on a quiz." |
