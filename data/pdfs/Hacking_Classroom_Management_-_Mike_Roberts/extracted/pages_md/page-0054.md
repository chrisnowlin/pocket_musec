to class). And while that is a great deal of time, it will be well worth it once you see the increased level of engagement.

## Standing desks.

If you are really looking to shake things up, consider investing in some standing desks. Many of the newer standing desks designed for students come complete with a rocker-bar at the bottom that allows students to quietly shake, rattle, and roll without disrupting the rest of the class. These desks keep the students at eye level, which in itself helps to keep the class engaged in the learning. Desks like these are especially beneficial for those students who, no matter how hard they try, just can’t keep themselves from moving. (See Act 4: Standing Desks.)

Behind the Scenes Act 4: Standing Desks

There are many ways to gauge whether a lesson is successful, but one of the biggest indicators for me is when my students start to question when we are going to do a certain activity again. There is no sweeter sound than a student asking, “Can we do a walk-n-talk today?” or saying, “When can we do that musical chairs thing again?” Movement gets students excited about the activity itself, and also gets them actively involved in the learning.
