parents, teachers, and administrators all worked tirelessly toward the same objective of getting the senior members of this all-girl Baltimore step team into college. Dancer Tayla Solomon’s mother intervened when Tayla’s grades begin to slip, counselor Paula Dofat made it her mission to ensure that each and every one of them graduated from college, and coach Gari McIntyre instilled that what they were doing was way bigger than step. She said, “It’s about sacrifice, not making excuses, [and] a positive attitude.”

A consistent stream of communication flows between the school, the students, and the parents, and helps push students to their full potential. They say it takes a village to raise a child, and the dedication of this school community illustrated the importance of relationships and communication on students’ success.

While I understand that parents can be challenging, I encourage you to give this hack a try and see how it works for you, your students, their parents, and school administrators. If there is one thing that parents love to do, it’s to hear (and talk) about the good their child has done. Sending emails and consistent communications is an easy way for you to make this happen.
