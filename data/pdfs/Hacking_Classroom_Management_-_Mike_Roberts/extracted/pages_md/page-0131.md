chance to share a few jokes with the class. You will obviously want to establish parameters for these jokes, but there is usually a student or two who has a good one ready to share. This is also an excellent opportunity for you to connect with your students by offering up a teacher joke or two. The cheesier the better!

- **PLAY BINGO.** Creating a class-themed game of BINGO is sure to engage all of your students! I generally mix up the squares to include topics that are academic, social, and personal. These are a great way to reinforce any skills taught in class while also fostering a positive student/teacher relationship. I often use these for summer reading assignments, but they could easily be adapted to review a unit or prepare for a test. (See Act 10: BINGO.)
