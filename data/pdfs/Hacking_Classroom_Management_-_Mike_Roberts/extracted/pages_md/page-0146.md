By Joe Sanfelippo ([@joesanfelippoFC](https://twitter.com/joesanfelippoFC)) and Tony Sinanis ([@tonysinanis](https://twitter.com/tonysinanis))

In the runaway bestseller *Hacking Leadership*, renowned school leaders Joe Sanfelippo and Tony Sinanis bring readers inside schools that few stakeholders have ever seen—places where students not only come first but have a unique voice in teaching and learning. Sanfelippo and Sinanis ignore the bureaucracy that stifles many leaders, focusing instead on building a culture of **engagement, transparency, and most important, fun**. *Hacking Leadership* has superintendents, principals, and teacher leaders around the world employing strategies they never before believed possible.

> “The authors do a beautiful job of helping leaders focus inward, instead of outward. This is an essential read for leaders who are, or want to lead, learner-centered schools.”  
> — **George Couros**, Author of *The Innovator’s Mindset*
