discussions (ten minutes or less) and one for longer discussions (more than ten minutes).
- **RESEARCH STANDING DESKS.** There is an abundance of information out there touting the physical and mental benefits of using a standing desk. Take a few minutes and see what the research says. If you agree with it, spend a few more minutes investigating the various brands and prices to see if some might fit into your school’s furniture budget for next year.

## A BLUEPRINT FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION
**Step 1: Decide to get moving.**
Before anything else can happen, be willing to make the choice that you are going to actively try this out. Controlled movement should be included in your daily lessons, even multiple times per day, so it is imperative that you believe in what you’re doing.

**Step 2: Find some spots where movement fits within your current curriculum.**
Like all else related to teaching, implementing controlled movement into your class will take a little planning. Look over your upcoming lessons and see if there are spots where you could include some of the suggested movements into your day. Teachers are often surprised at how easily movement can be added to what they already do, and many of the ideas can be adapted to fit pretty much any topic. So while there is no need to redo all your lessons to make this work, it does require you to reevaluate how your students engage themselves with the learning.
