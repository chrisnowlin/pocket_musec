hold high expectations for students. During one of the first class periods of the year, Escalante proudly announced, “You’re going to work harder here than you’ve ever worked anywhere else. And the only thing I ask from you is ‘ganas.’ Desire.” Escalante didn’t care about his students’ pasts. Instead, he focused on the *potential* he saw in each and every one, and they responded via hard work and respect. Later, when questioned about his unique methods and the success of previously low-achieving students, Escalante responded by saying, “Students will rise to the level of expectation.” As a result, all eighteen of Escalante’s calculus students passed the AP exam—twice.

So the question is: Do you have the ‘ganas’ to expect the best from your students? To be the type of teacher they make movies about, you’ll want to model and maintain high expectations for your students and for yourself.
