you can implement immediately.

- **TALK TO YOUR STUDENTS ABOUT UPCOMING EVENTS.** You may not hear about events until after they are over, but if you regularly ask your students what activities they are involved in, you will stay up-to-date on potential events to visit.
- **LOOK AT A SCHOOL CALENDAR AND PUT TOGETHER A PLAN.** If your school is like mine, there is always *something* coming up soon. Take a look at upcoming events, and see which ones work with your schedule, and which ones include your students.
- **CREATE AN EVENT BOARD.** Tape off a portion of your board and label it “Upcoming School Events.” Include a section identifying the date, time, event, and location of future activities. This is a great way to keep you posted and help students become engaged with what their classmates are doing, further solidifying the community vibe. (See Act 3: Events.)
