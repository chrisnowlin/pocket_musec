# HACKING DIGITAL LEARNING STRATEGIES
## 10 Ways to Launch EdTech Missions in Your Classroom
By Shelly Sanchez Terrell (@ShellTerrell)

In *Hacking Digital Learning Strategies*, international EdTech presenter and NAPW Woman of the Year Shelly Sanchez Terrell demonstrates the power of EdTech Missions—lessons and projects that inspire learners to use web tools and social media to innovate, research, collaborate, problem-solve, campaign, crowd fund, crowdsource, and publish. The 10 Missions in Hacking DLS are more than enough to transform how teachers integrate technology, but there’s also much more here. Included in the book is a 38-page **Mission Toolkit**, complete with reproducible mission cards, badges, polls, and other handouts that you can copy and distribute to students immediately.

This book provides relevance to a 21st century educator.”
