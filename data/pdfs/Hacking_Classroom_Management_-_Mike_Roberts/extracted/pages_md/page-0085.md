In *Freedom Writers*, first-year teacher Erin Gruwell was in desperate need of finding ways to help her students learn. Like many teachers, both beginners and veterans, she entered the classroom with a teaching plan that she assumed would work. The problem was, she was making those assumptions based on who she thought her students would be rather than on who they actually were.

After several tough weeks, Ms. Gruwell inadvertently began to personalize the learning for her students when she started to talk to them about their lives, and as a result, she began to find success. She began to do pre-assessments to see what her students knew, she created an ungraded journal assignment for her students to share their thoughts, and she allowed them to do self-assessments. Reflection became a regular part of the class environment, and she herself constantly looked for new ways to present the curriculum. In the end, because of the personalized connection she made through her teaching, she was able to look her students in the eyes each day and tell them, “I see who you are.”

From my experience, when I have made the effort to personalize the learning for my students, they have consistently exceeded my expectations. It helps me target their learning more precisely, and allows them to become active participants in their learning. It’s effective, it’s meaningful, and it’s engaging. Now it’s your turn to find out how your students learn best.
