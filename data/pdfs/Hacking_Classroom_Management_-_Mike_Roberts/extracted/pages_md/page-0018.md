time, but it also establishes trust with them (and perhaps a willingness to answer questions in the future) that will remain throughout the year.

## A BLUEPRINT FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION

**Step 1: Commit to letting students be empowered.**

It’s one thing to say you are transferring some of the power of the class to the students, but it’s another to actually do it. This is not as easy as it sounds, and you may fall back to your old ways at times. But just remember that the end goal is to empower your students more in the routines of class, and every time you stumble, get back up and keep moving forward.

**Step 2: Frame expectations in a positive tone.**

The more rules you have, the more likely students are to break them. So rather than posting a bunch of rules all over your walls, why not establish a few class agreements that encompass the big-ticket behavioral concepts? And instead of posting signs about no swearing, hitting, yelling, or running, why not establish and discuss what appropriate behavior looks like? Putting these ideas into a positive context will let students know what they should be doing, rather than constantly telling them what they shouldn’t be doing. (See Act 1: It’s All in How You Say It.)
