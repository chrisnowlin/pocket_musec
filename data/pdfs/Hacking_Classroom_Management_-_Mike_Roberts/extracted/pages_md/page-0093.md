- **HAVE STUDENTS SELF-ASSESS THEIR EFFORT.** As students leave your class, request that they self-assess their overall effort in class. I ask them to think about their participation, attitude, and engagement with the learning. This can be done as an exit ticket, or you can have them “high five” their ratings as they walk out the door. I usually provide three options—Green = Awesome, Yellow = As Expected, and Red = I’ll Do Better Tomorrow—but you can provide as many levels as you feel are appropriate. Either method serves as an effective, low-stakes opportunity for your students to be reflective about their work. (See Act 7: High Five Hands.)
