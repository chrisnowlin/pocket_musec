## THE PROBLEM: TEACHERS TEACH THEIR CONTENT RATHER THAN THEIR STUDENTS

The lecture. It’s been a part of teaching for as long as teaching itself. And while its effectiveness has come under scrutiny over the past few years, there are numerous reasons why it has been able to survive throughout time, including:

- Teachers control the ideas being presented.
- A great deal of information can be shared quickly.
- The topic can be presented to a very large audience.
- It provides a very low-risk environment for students.
