stakeholder in the success, or failure, of the school, and he refused to let good enough be *good enough*. He focused on what is truly important (improving student lives), and his students repaid him by putting forth their best efforts in and out of class. Principal Clark gave them a voice in the educational process, while still maintaining high standards (see Hack 2).

By giving your students a little leeway with the classic rules of classroom management (seating chart, bathroom breaks), and tweaking how you run the day-to-day routines (no more cold calling, mass class punishments, sharing the class average), you can dramatically improve the engagement, learning, and relationships. As you begin to redistribute the power of the class in ways that are more student-centered, your students will become more invested in wanting all aspects of the class to succeed.
