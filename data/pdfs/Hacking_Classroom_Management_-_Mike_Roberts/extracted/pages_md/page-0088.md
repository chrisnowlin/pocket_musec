when they are given the opportunity to openly reflect and question the learning, they become more involved in wanting to understand the ideas and concepts being presented.

**One of the biggest hurdles for students to get over initially is the idea that being wrong is bad.**

You can find a wide range of methods that incorporate student input into the grading process, each with its own logic and benefit. Here are some strategies to encourage students to take a leading role in assessment.

**Self-assessment.** Allowing students to self-assess gives them the chance to reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of their individual learning. This is in stark contrast to traditional grading, which often has students comparing themselves based against what others have learned. Additionally, students are more willing to be authentic in their assessment since they themselves are the ones judging the product quality. The result is that students are willing to work harder for the sake of learning rather than for the grade.

I use self-assessment in a variety of ways, but regardless of whether it’s for a writing assignment, a project, or a participation grade, the method is pretty similar.

1. Provide a rubric or verbally identify the learning targets and expectations of the assignment to make sure everyone is on the same page prior to the assessment.
2. After answering any clarifying questions, have students self-assess their work based on the guidelines.
