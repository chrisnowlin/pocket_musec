the relationships. But the secret to this success lies in how you blend those two concepts together.

In the movie *Dangerous Minds*, new teacher LouAnne Johnson, a former Marine, entered her classroom armed with plenty of content knowledge but very little understanding of how classroom management worked. Slowly she began to realize that in order for learning to occur, she needed to connect with her students beyond the textbooks. She discovered that even the smallest act of kindness could make a lasting impression. Whether it was an impromptu karate lesson at the beginning of class, creating starter sentences based on of her students’ lives, or making a Bob Dylan reference to emphasize a point, Ms. Johnson recognized that the best learning occurred only after her students knew that she cared about them as people. On any given day, she looked for small victories for which to praise her students, and she focused on their personal and academic growth more than test scores.

In order for any meaningful learning to take place *in* my class, I have to first form meaningful relationships *with* my class. It’s surprising to discover that a fist bump or a shout-out can oftentimes mean a lot more to a student than the greatest of lesson plans. So don’t be fooled; good things definitely can come in small packages.
