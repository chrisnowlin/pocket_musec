# MEET THE AUTHOR

**Mike Roberts** has taught middle school English for the past twenty years. In that time, he has received numerous awards, including the 2014 Utah English Teacher of the Year. Beyond the classroom, he has been a featured speaker at dozens of state, regional, and national conferences. He has served on many educational committees, and he was a featured columnist in *English Journal*, where he shared his insights on using YA literature in the classroom. Additionally, he co-authored *The New Science Teacher’s Handbook: What You Didn’t Learn From Student Teaching*. Beyond his middle school teaching, Mike also teaches college classes focused on classroom management and literacy in the content areas. He loves sharing his ideas with others, and he always feels honored when people actually show up to hear him speak. When he’s not teaching or presenting, Mike can usually be found running ultramarathons in the mountains. And even after all these years, he’s still not sure which takes more energy . . . a week with eighth graders or running a hundred-mile race.
