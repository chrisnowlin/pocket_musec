you could become an *average* teacher. And you don’t continually participate in professional development opportunities with the goal that you can turn into a *slightly better* educator. Finally, you don’t keep up with all the latest educational trends on your free time praying that they will help you become a *mediocre* teacher. Nah, you want more that that! You want to be the best teacher that you can be—for both yourself and your students. It’s one thing to be a good teacher; it’s another to be the type of teacher they make movies about! The fact that you picked up this book shows that you have the desire to become one of those teachers, and now you have the strategies to make it happen.

I truly believe that teaching is the greatest job in the world, and each one of us, regardless of who, what, or where we teach, has the opportunity to changes lives *every single day*. It is my hope that the ideas and examples presented here will help you accomplish that.
