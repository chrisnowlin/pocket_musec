# HACKING ASSESSMENT
## 10 Ways to Go Gradeless in a Traditional Grades School
By Starr Sackstein (@mssackstein)

In the bestselling *Hacking Assessment*, award-winning teacher and world-renowned formative assessment expert Starr Sackstein unravels one of education’s oldest mysteries: how to assess learning without grades—even in a school that uses numbers, letters, GPAs, and report cards. While many educators can only muse about the possibility of a world without grades, teachers like Sackstein are reimagining education. In this unique, eagerly anticipated book, Sackstein shows you exactly how to create a remarkable no-grades classroom like hers, a vibrant place where students grow, share, thrive, and become independent learners who never ask, “What’s this worth?”

> “The beauty of the book is that it is not an empty argument against grades – but rather filled with valuable alternatives that are practical and will help to refocus the classroom on what matters most.”
