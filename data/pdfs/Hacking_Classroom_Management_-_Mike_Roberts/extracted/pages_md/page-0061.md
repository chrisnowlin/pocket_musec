perspective of the world, Mr. Keating took every opportunity to incorporate movement into his curriculum. And while others often frowned upon his methods, he believed that in order to fully engage his students, he, along with all teachers, must constantly look at things in a different way. Rather than sticking to the status quo of teaching, he opted to do what he knew was in the best interest of his students.

For years, students have been told to “Sit still and listen,” and frankly, it’s time for a more effective and modern teaching style. Controlled movement has changed how I manage my class, as well as the learning that occurs within it. Moving in this manner allows students to involve both their bodies and their minds in the learning process, and as result, the students are more engaged and receptive to learning. As an added bonus, the constant interruptions of students getting up and disrupting the class flow have been eliminated. I’m confident that, if you give it a shot, the same will happen within your class.
