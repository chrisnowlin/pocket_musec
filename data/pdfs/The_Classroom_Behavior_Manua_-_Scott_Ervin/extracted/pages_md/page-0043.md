Before They Arrive 35

The students you most need to monitor are the 5s, the students with the history of using the most negative behaviors the most often. Place your 5s in positions where you can be behind the ears of at least two of them when you’re in a PP. This positioning forms the Power V (see Figure 3.4). If your classroom has two “super 5s” (i.e., two students who have significantly worse behavior than everyone else), you should seat them where you can create a Power V with them. Whenever possible, if you can arrange students so that you can be behind three 5s’ ears from one PP, then you have established an especially effective PP—the Power E (see Figure 3.5). Make sure you have arranged your classroom in a way that you can take advantage of more than one Power V or perhaps one Power E.
