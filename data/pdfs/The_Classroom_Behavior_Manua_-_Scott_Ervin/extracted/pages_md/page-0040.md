## Seating Within and Among Teams  
To be optimally effective, you should also arrange seating within your teams, keeping these parameters in mind:  

- **Surround 5s with 1s and 2s.** You want to sandwich 5s between 1s and 2s. However, as you arrange the team spaces, be aware of the 5s’ placement with respect to other teams. You don’t want a 5 from one team backing up against a 5 from another.  
- **Surround Es with As and Bs.** Again, try to keep in mind the arrangement of students with regards to other teams, too. Prioritize placement by behavioral rank.  
- **Place the 5 who has a history of the most severe behavior close to the area where you will most often be during independent work time.** For instance, if you are an elementary school teacher who works with small groups during silent sustained reading, put your most difficult 5 on a team near the spot where you will be working with small groups. Make sure you are behind that student’s ear and, if possible, positioned at the vertex of a Power V (see pages 34–35). Do not separate
