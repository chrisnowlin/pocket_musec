# Conclusion: It Starts with You

You are the hero of this story.

Heroes are those who know that there is a job to be done and set themselves to do it. The job is not seen as a job at all, but as a higher calling, a responsibility: something that must be done. A hero’s life will feel incomplete if that calling is left unheeded.

That is why whether it is possible to do the job that needs to be done is irrelevant to the hero. Indeed, if someone is called to do something, they will get the job done or die trying. At the start of a teaching career, teachers rarely know how they will be successful. They just know that they are called to help students. They think, “I’ll have to figure this out. I have no choice.”

This book is for the heroes who just need the right support and the right tools to heed their calling. I wrote it because it is the tool that I needed but did not have at the beginning of my career.

Heroes know that change starts with them. Teachers know that it is their behavior, what they do, that can mold their students into people who can be successful, happy, and healthy. This book is simply a manual for exactly how educators should behave so that they can be the best hero that they can be.

You now have the tool and the power to change your behavior.

Once you change your behavior, you can change the behaviors of your students.

Once your students change their behaviors, they can change the world.

It starts with you . . . right now.
