Control-Sharing Procedures

*Give students control on your terms so  
they don’t take it on theirs.*

I had been warned about Juriah.

I had received his student card with its requisite behavioral and academic information. He disrupted constantly. He would refuse to do anything he didn’t feel like doing at any given time. The card indicated that the fact that both of Juriah’s parents were in prison was “no excuse” for his behavior. The teacher included a complaint that she had sent him to the Intervention Assistance Team, feeling that his inability to do work or follow directions was due to a severe learning disability. Subsequent assessments of Juriah revealed no such disability.

I was in my 13th year working with extremely difficult kids, and I had requested that Juriah, identified as one of the toughest students in the school, be put in my room.
