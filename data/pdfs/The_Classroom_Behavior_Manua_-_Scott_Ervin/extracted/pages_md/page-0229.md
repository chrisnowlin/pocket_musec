Delayed Learning Opportunities

When I received Michael into my classroom unexpectedly, he suffered from a tremendous and life-threatening deficit: he did not know how to use positive behaviors to get what he wanted in life. There is no more destructive deficit for human beings. Students who continue to have this deficit into adulthood will live lives of pain and misery. When this deficit is not addressed by parents, it must be addressed by educators.

Delayed Learning Opportunities (DLOs) are an essential part of this endeavor. DLOs are opportunities for students to learn to use positive behaviors that help to create a positive environment in the classroom. DLOs teach students to use positive behaviors and be responsible for their behaviors, giving them the opportunity to become happy, productive, and successful members of society.

DLOs do not incorporate warnings, lectures, threats, or punishments. These hurtful strategies, which are all too often part of traditional discipline, are not effective at altering behaviors and are therefore not included in this manual. DLOs are the only way to effectively teach all students, with kindness and empathy, how to use positive, prosocial behaviors. This chapter will systematically and explicitly teach you exactly how to use Gentle Guidance Interventions and Delayed Learning Opportunities with your students.
