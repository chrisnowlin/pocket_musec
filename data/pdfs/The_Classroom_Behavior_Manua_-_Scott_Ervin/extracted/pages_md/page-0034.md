## Before They Arrive  

*Set up the classroom for optimal behavioral leadership.*  

Many years ago, I accepted a position teaching my own 1st grade classroom—two days before school started. I spent 16 hours each of those days decorating and setting up a pretty awesome-looking classroom, especially for a male teacher. Desks were lined up just so; name tags were created; book bins and reading areas were arranged perfectly. Colorful bulletin boards (oh, what bulletin boards!) were posted in both the room and the hallway with encouraging words and room to display the quality, wonderful work that was sure to come from my students.  

I had timed, to the minute, when we would be transitioning from one well-planned activity to another. Nothing was left to chance. Every moment had been played over and over in my mind. I knew exactly how I would take attendance. I knew where my hallway passes and nurse’s passes were and, by golly, I knew how and when to use them. I had a class roster and a bus list. Everything was in place. I was ready. My room was ready.  

Then the day began.  

In the first hour, a kid pulled down my behavior chart while his new friends laughed hysterically. My plans for timely and organized transitions were a joke: several students would do what they wanted when they wanted to do it, wandering aimlessly around the room in the meantime.
