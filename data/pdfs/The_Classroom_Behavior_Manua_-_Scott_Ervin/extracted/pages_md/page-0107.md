Relationship-Building Procedures allow teachers the opportunity to establish and manage the machinery necessary to build optimal relationships with students, no matter how difficult those students are. Establishing these procedures allows the relationships to be built as a matter of routine, instead of having to find new and novel ways of building relationships on the fly while you are trying to teach. The next chapter will outline exactly how to establish and manage procedures for sharing control of the classroom in a healthy way and on your terms, so that students are less likely to take control on their terms.
