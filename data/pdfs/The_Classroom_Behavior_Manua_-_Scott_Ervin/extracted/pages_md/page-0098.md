90 The Classroom Behavior Manual

2. **Cede ownership of the rules.** Remind your students that as the teacher, you are only in the room to teach, not to own the room. Emphasize that they are in *their* classroom. Ask them to find where in the room the rules are posted. When students realize that rules are not posted anywhere in the room, ask, “Why do you think that is?” Explain that because the classroom is theirs, they must make the rules for themselves.

3. **Invite students to suggest rules for the class and write them on the board.** Point out that these rules are just suggestions for now, and they won’t automatically become class rules just because they’re on the board. Accept all appropriate suggestions. For this procedure, *appropriate* means that the rule doesn’t involve inappropriate language or suggestions that are purposely mean, unsafe, or hurtful. Students can, however, nominate bad rules that would lead to chaos. In other words, “Scream as loudly as you want at all times” can go on the board; “Don’t sit next to Tayla because she *@%*ing stinks” cannot.

See Figure 5.1 for an illustration of what the process might look like as you engage your students in refining their list.
