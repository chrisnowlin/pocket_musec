While note passing may not be particularly bothersome to me, if I have used four or five interventions over a two-day period for note passing, it is probably a good idea for me also to move to a DLO. Any behavior that you feel is very serious or is causing any type of major problem for other people (including you) should generate a DLO. Remember, though, that the PLOs woven into the Real-World Workshop procedure provide learning opportunities for students refusing to do work, so there is no reason to ever use DLOs for this!
