and wisdom transformed this manual from something barely readable into some-
thing a publisher would be interested in.

To Genny Ostertag, Allison Scott, Megan Doyle, and the entire team at ASCD for
seeing the value in the book, for your expertise, for your know-how, your hard work,
and your enthusiasm. I value our partnership, and I know that we will change the
world together!

To my mother, Anice Ervin. Mom, you told me once that I had to be great. I heard
what you said and understood what you meant. You inspire me to be a better person,
which made this book possible.

To all K-12 educators. This book was not just written for you—it was writ-
ten by you. I created these strategies and procedures from watching other teach-
ers’ best practices that worked but were not written down anywhere. I improved
them, systematized them, and created something new and comprehensive in scope.
Teachers are the experts. Behavioral leadership is a trade: something that you do, not
something that you merely know about. This is a trade manual, created by and for
educators.
