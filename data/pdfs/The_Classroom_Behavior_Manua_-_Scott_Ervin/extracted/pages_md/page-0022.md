## Before You Begin

Understand the why and the how of this manual.

Several months after I started substitute teaching, I achieved the unthinkable: for the first time, the 5th grade class that I had been teaching for weeks was quiet. I had done it. I had their attention. They looked at me, their eyes wide, their attention rapt, their bodies still, their voices silent.

For 10 seconds.

Then, one snicker chorused and escalated into a classroom filled with belly laughs. Across the room, the desk I had just thrown lay in silent testament to my behavior management skills.

Oops.

Everyone has a breaking point. That day, I hit mine.

I can describe all the events and conditions that led up to my abrupt outburst, but really, I had just one reason for picking up that desk, flinging it into a wall, and proceeding to yell incoherently at an 11-year-old boy: I had no idea what I was doing.

Nothing had changed since the first day that I had arrived to substitute. Nothing worked. I was educated. I was hardheaded. I was committed. I was where I wanted to be.

But nothing worked.

I was broken in. I knew the kids. I knew the school and the community. I recognized the challenging conditions that trailed them into my classroom.
