Positive student behaviors are desired outcomes, but this **manual concentrates on inputs**. How do you respond to difficult behavior in the moment when you know that punitive, compliance-based behavior management is so often ineffectual? What’s the best way to prevent students from acting out in the first place? The path to success requires **behavioral leadership**, in which teachers strategically model and affirm the behaviors they want to see in students.

Behavior expert Scott Ervin calls on his two decades of experience to share the most effective strategies and procedures to foster positive, prosocial student behavior that supports learning, including ways to

- Organize your physical classroom to support positive classroom management.
- Build positive teacher-student relationships.
- Share control with students in a way that best fosters their autonomy.

The *Classroom Behavior Manual* is a resource you can return to again and again, packed with more than 100 strategies and dozens of procedures and tools. Learn how to respond to negative behaviors in nonpunitive ways so that you can ensure all students’ school days are as calm, engaging, and educational as they possibly can be.
