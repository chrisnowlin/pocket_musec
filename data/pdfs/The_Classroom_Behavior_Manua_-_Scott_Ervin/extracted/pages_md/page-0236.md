228 The Classroom Behavior Manual

1. Calm Signal
2. Expression of regret
3. Notification of the DLO

You will choose each part, and then put them all together to create your own personal script that is perfect for you.

While you will be choosing the words for each element, you must not deviate from the order above. The Calm Signal needs to do its magic of changing the student’s brain chemistry, and then you will double down on the calm sadness by expressing regret. Only then will you notify the student that a DLO will be coming sometime in the future.

**Part 1: Calm Signal**

Of course, you have already decided upon your personal Calm Signal. For review, here are some choices:

Oh, man.          Huh.
Oh, boy.          Oh.
Yikes.            Whoa.
Yeesh.            Blarg.
Ugh.              (The sound of a slow exhale)

To begin to create your DLO Delaying Script, first write your Calm Signal down on a piece of paper.

**Part 2: Expression of Regret**

Now you can choose an expression of regret. The purpose of the expression of regret is to double down on the sadness expressed in the Calm Signal and to communicate that you are not upset or angry with the student. This shows the student that you are on the same team and that together, you and the student will be working to defeat the behavior itself. Here are some suggestions:

This is a tough one.
This is rough.
This is less than ideal.
This is a difficult situation.
This is unfortunate.
