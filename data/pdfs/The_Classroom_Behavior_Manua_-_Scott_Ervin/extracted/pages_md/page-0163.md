Academic Control-Sharing Procedures 155

Eventually on Day 2, only those truly struggling academically or having problems with focus or refusing to work (which is fine) will still be on their Nows—perhaps three students or so. When it is time to teach another lesson, do so. Once you finish teaching that lesson, add the corresponding Now to the Nows and Laters Board.

Nows
- Math book, page 1, #6-12
- Write introductory narrative paragraph

Laters
- Create team tags
- Read
- ?

Now everyone has a new Now (“Write introductory narrative paragraph”), and that is what they all should work on until they are finished. Once that task is completed, the three students who did not finish their math task should double back to complete it. Everyone else, once done with the narrative paragraph, can do their Laters. Trust that your students will come to recognize this reality on their own. Pointing it out or, worse, lecturing kids about it, will have the opposite of the intended effect. Trust the procedure to do the teaching.

Students will complete their second Now with the benefit of your expert instruction while you are also holding them accountable by not allowing them to get to their Laters before finishing all of their Nows. Again, you will notice that you are more and more able to help those who need help as more and more students move on to their Laters.

The same pattern will happen in the afternoon when a reading lesson is added:

Nows
- Math book, page 1, #6-12
- Write introductory narrative paragraph
- Answer reading questions #1-4

Laters
- Create team tags
- Read
- ?

With perhaps 45 minutes left in the academic day, you can reveal your Mystery Later. On Day 1, you added “Recess.” For simplicity, we’ll add the same Mystery Later here:
