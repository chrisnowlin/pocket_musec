## Gentle Guidance Interventions

As anyone who remembers their own childhood can attest, students sometimes get slightly off track by dabbling in negative behaviors in such a way that it doesn’t cause a major problem, and they just need to get guided back to the right path. Unfortunately, the traditional ways of guiding students back to using positive behaviors (warnings, demands, lectures, and threats) will drive explosive, unhealthy students into worse behaviors while being less than effective with all students.

A vast majority of the time, negative behaviors can be dealt with by using Gentle Guidance Interventions (GGIs). GGIs are ways of calmly guiding students to use positive behaviors that do not frighten or intimidate students, even if those students have a propensity for being easily frightened or intimidated. GGIs are the first intervention to use to help Michaels and Mykeshas learn the most important lessons they will ever learn: that negative behaviors don’t work and that positive, prosocial behaviors are the pathway to success and happiness.

### Avoiding the “Impossible Choice”

When a student uses a minor negative behavior that causes problems for other people but does not require what are traditionally called “punishments” or “consequences,” traditional discipline requires that educators make an impossible choice.
