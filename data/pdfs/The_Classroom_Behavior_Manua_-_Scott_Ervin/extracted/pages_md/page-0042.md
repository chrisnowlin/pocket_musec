If yes, congratulations! Your instructional spots are PPs. If an instructional spot is not a PP, then you need to rearrange your room.

## Identifying Secondary Power Positions

In addition to instructional PPs, you should have at least two other Secondary Power Positions (SPPs). An SPP is a place from which you can see every student when you are not giving direct instruction. Study Figure 3.3. Notice the central locations of the instructional PPs, and then contrast them with the peripheral SPPs, where you could position yourself when not teaching to observe the classroom.

Having PPs and SPPs will optimize your effectiveness as the classroom’s Friendly, Loving Alpha (FLA). An FLA is a teacher who is confident, assertive, and loving, and who establishes themselves as the kind boss of the classroom.

## Setting Up Your Class to Use the Power V

The best position to monitor a student is from a 45-degree angle behind the student’s ear. From here, you can observe what a student is doing and where a student is looking without the student being able to see you making these observations.
