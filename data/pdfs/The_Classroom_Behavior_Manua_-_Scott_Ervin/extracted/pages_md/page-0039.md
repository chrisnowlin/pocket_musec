# Positioning Students in the Classroom

Once you have put your students on teams, you need to decide where they will be sitting. This involves two considerations: first, where teammates will sit relative to one another, and second, where teams will be positioned within the room.

## Team Configurations

You want to start by arranging students in their team configurations. This means you need to group tables or desks together. For elementary school, desks that face each other or tables are optimal for true teamwork as well as for holding one another accountable. I also recommend this arrangement for older students if it fits with your educational plan. Figures 3.1 and 3.2 show clustered teams and teams grouped in rows. Notice that the arrangement of tables and desks creates distinct team areas, with space separating each team from the others.

Begin by arranging your team clusters or rows on paper and in your physical space. Figure 3.1 shows team clusters using tables. You can also arrange clusters by having individual desks face each other. Figure 3.2 shows team rows using desks. You can also arrange rows using long tables.
