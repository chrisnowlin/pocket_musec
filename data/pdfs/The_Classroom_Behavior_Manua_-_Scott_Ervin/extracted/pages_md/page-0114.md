# Student Job Procedures

Giving students jobs in the classroom has substantial benefits. When done correctly, charging students with specific classroom tasks can teach them important life lessons and responsibility. Many teachers create a job chart whereby the names of students are rotated every month, week, or day, and the students do whichever job their name is next to on the job chart. Unfortunately, this takes far too much time and energy, and teaches students unhealthy, unrealistic lessons about responsibility and employment. I suggest that any teacher using a job chart throw it out and recommend to preservice teachers that they never start using one.

Instead, I recommend applying the Student Job Procedures detailed in this chapter. The pros and cons can be summed up simply.

Reasons not to use job charts:

* Making job charts takes time and energy.
* Job charts take time and energy to maintain.
* Taking time and energy to make and maintain job charts tells the teacher and the students that maintenance of the classroom is the teacher’s job, not the students’.
* Job charts feel insulting and childish to older students (because they are).
* Arbitrarily forcing students to do jobs that they do not want could create a needless power struggle.
