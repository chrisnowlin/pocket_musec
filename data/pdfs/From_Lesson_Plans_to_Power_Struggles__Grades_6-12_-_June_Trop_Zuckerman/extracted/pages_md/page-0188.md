# Note: Crimes or Misbehaviors

Violence or the threat of violence, vandalism, theft, and the possession of drugs, alcohol, or weapons are crimes. Therefore, teachers need to refer these occurrences to the administration. On the other hand, classroom disruptions are **misbehaviors**. Thus teachers themselves are responsible for treating them.
