Each of the three teachers adopted a routine to start or signal the start of each lesson. *If used consistently, a routine minimizes the time and energy needed to direct a regular classroom event.* A routine also reduces the number of decisions the teacher must make. However, teachers need to teach their students the routine explicitly, use it consistently, and encourage their students to learn it. Consider using both routines, the do-now and the Silence Signal, to start your lessons. Use Mark’s do-now so that students come in, sit down, and, without prompting, get ready for the lesson. Then use Jodi’s signal to start the lesson as they’re gathering the last of their materials.
