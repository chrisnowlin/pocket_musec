## When an Administrative Intervention Is Necessary

The first *story* is about Marilyn, who, as one of several chaperones, had to decide whether an administrative intervention was necessary. The second story is about Sari, who, rather than call for an administrative intervention, sought her administrator’s advice instead.

### Marilyn’s Story

Four other teachers and I chaperoned two senior classes on a field trip. Dressed in jeans and carrying a backpack, I suppose I resembled a student myself. Some students knew who I was; others did not. No one bothered to ask.

While hiking, I overheard two boys discussing their plans to smoke marijuana. I watched as they patted their pockets with assurance.

Having witnessed their discussion, I knew I had to assert myself. I informed the teacher in charge, who then informed the other three chaperones. The teacher in charge then lagged behind to watch the boys for suspicious behavior. Soon after that, she confiscated a joint from the boy who was about to put it in his mouth.

This experience has enhanced my confidence as a leader and *novice teacher*. I knew what the right thing to do should be, and I did it. The next day, the assistant principal called me down to her office to commend my action, especially in light of my inexperience. Sadly, I know this situation could be the first of many.
