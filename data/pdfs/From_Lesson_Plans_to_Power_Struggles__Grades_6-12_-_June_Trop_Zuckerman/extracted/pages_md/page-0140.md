## When a Student Does Little or No Schoolwork

Three **novice teachers** each responded to a student who had been doing little or no schoolwork. Some students who do little or no schoolwork are passive; others are disruptive. Some can’t do the work; others can but won’t. Luke’s **Story** is about a passive student who wouldn’t do the work. Wilma’s Story is about a disruptive student who also wouldn’t do the work. Jeremy’s Story is about a disruptive student who couldn’t do the work.

### Luke’s Story

After giving a short lecture on the genres of fiction, I handed out a worksheet for the students to match each genre to an appropriate story synopsis. One boy in the front of the room, Greg, pushed the worksheet away, saying, “I can’t do this.” Then he folded his arms and laid his head down on the desk. This unwillingness to complete or even attempt an assignment is typical for him.

The rest of the students finished their worksheets, and as I began to collect them, I wondered what to say to Greg. Then it came to me.

I told him to put his name on the paper. When he asked why, I told him, “Because I have to keep track of the work you do in here.” He reluctantly put his name on the sheet.

That night I made sure to correct the worksheets so I could hand them back the next day. I wanted to show Greg that his lack of effort would be reflected in his grade. I put a large zero at the top of his paper
