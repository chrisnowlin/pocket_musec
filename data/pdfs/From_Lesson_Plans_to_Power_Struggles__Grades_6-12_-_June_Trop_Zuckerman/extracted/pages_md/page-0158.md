Ginott (1972) advises teachers to express their anger without insult and their indignation without indignity. When angry, teachers should describe what they see, how they feel, and what they expect. In other words, teachers should attack the problem, not the person. They should give an “I” message, not a “you” message.

Similarly, Gordon (1989) uses the “I” message as a way for the teacher to alert students to the impact their disruptive behavior is having on others.
