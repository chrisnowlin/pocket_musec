But I really liked the idea of playing a game as a review. The kids liked the idea too. So when it came time to review for the next exam, I decided to do things differently. The day before the game, I printed up a set of directions for the students to read over and discuss. I also chose three volunteers, one for each of the following jobs: to keep a tally of the scores, to determine which group had buzzed in first, and to erase the categories already selected. Some kids were confused in the beginning but fewer than during the previous game. Now, every time we play the game, they get better and better with the procedure.

The important thing I learned is that you might never be able to predict all the trouble spots. Just see what works and what doesn’t, and go from there. You can’t give up immediately.

Michelle, like Michael, realized the need to plan for the execution of her lesson. However, she gave her students additional opportunities to learn the procedure, in this case the **routine** for playing Jeopardy! so she could better execute that kind of lesson in the future. A routine is a set of procedures (with implicit behavioral expectations) to execute a particular activity. *If used consistently, a routine minimizes the time and energy needed to direct a regular classroom event.* Accordingly, routines are well worth teaching early in the school year. How could you use a routine to enhance the execution of one of your lessons?
