others. For example, Todd could say, “Your not sitting in your chair will postpone the lesson closure for everybody.” Only if necessary would Todd progress to the next step, offering Aaron a choice with consequences: “Aaron, you have a choice. You can sit in your chair now, or you and I can discuss your behavior later.”

Todd could calmly and routinely manage this series of progressively more direct and intrusive interventions only if he had already devised a systematic management plan. *Teachers need a systematic management plan ranging from subtle to progressively more direct and intrusive interventions.*

Todd and Breeanne could each protect their learning environment with a minimally intrusive strategy by attributing their students’ infractions to forgetfulness or lapses in self-control rather than to defiance. *Resist the impulse to attribute minor infractions to defiance.* Accordingly, they could continue their lesson without having to issue either an order or a punishment. *Issuing an order promotes defiance, not cooperation. And punishment does not deter misbehavior; it fosters resentment, not cooperation.*

## Note to Todd’s Story: Systematic Management Plan

Teachers need a systematic management plan to respond calmly and consistently to ordinary classroom misbehaviors. Levin and Nolan (2007) advocate a model that features a hierarchy of responses ranging from subtle interventions, in which the student has an opportunity to exercise self-control, to progressively more intrusive and teacher-directed interventions. How does your hierarchy of interventions compare with the one proposed for Todd?
