# When You Have a Persistently Noisy Class

Do you see yourself as a **classroom manager** or as only a **disciplinarian**? A disciplinarian concentrates on treating **misbehavior**, whereas a classroom manager concentrates on continuing the lesson so as to engage as many students as possible in learning activities. The distinction is important. In this chapter, the degree of success of the **novice teachers** coping with a persistently noisy class depended upon their ability to conceptualize their role more broadly than that of a disciplinarian, to see themselves instead as managers.

Ten novice teachers each contended with unremitting side chatter, usually in an afternoon class. Their **stories** are arranged in sets to demonstrate both within and across the sets the range in the teachers’ ability to claim their power as a manager and use that power to curb the noise.

In the first set of stories, two novice teachers each begin redefining themselves as a manager. In the second set, three novice teachers each claim their power to be a manager and then use that power to effect various strategies. In the third set, three novice teachers each begin to formulate a systematic management plan, and in the fourth set, two novice teachers each act to reshape their class’s norms.
