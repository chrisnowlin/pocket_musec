# When a Student Persistently Seeks Attention

In the first five of these stories, the **novice teachers** explain how they each dealt with a student who persistently seeks attention. In the last story, the teacher asks for advice in dealing with such a student.

## Claire’s Story

I have a student who is 19 and in the 13th grade. His name is Devon. He constantly seeks attention in one of two ways: telling others to be quiet and pay attention or disrupting the class by talking, joking, or even getting up and walking around (ostensibly to blow his nose or sharpen a pencil). He never turns in an assignment.

One day, Devon was leaning back, his chair inclined, his feet on his desk. His shirt was pulled halfway up, revealing a belly-button ring. He was pulling a string through the ring, back and forth. The rest of the class was on task, relatively speaking, and we were on a roll. Rather than speak to Devon, I ignored him for a while. Then, as I walked by him—I circulate around the room continuously—I gave him a look of disgust. He laughed. I did not. Surprisingly, a few others snickered.

Devon sat up and stopped his string-through-the-ring trick. I was not only surprised that his classmates snickered at his behavior but amazed that he cared how I or his classmates reacted.
