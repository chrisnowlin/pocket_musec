misconceptions, fears, frustrations, disappointments, and failures as well as the insights, victories, satisfactions, and growth of a novice teacher. Examples of the practical principles I advance that derive from his work include the following:

- *Preparation and organization are crucial to the execution of an activity-based lesson.*
- *Novice teachers have difficulty claiming their power as the authority.*
- *If used consistently, a **routine** minimizes the time and energy needed to direct a regular classroom event.*

## Ethical Perspectives

Teaching is a moral craft. A classroom management strategy must therefore not only promote social order, but the principles that justify its use must exemplify an ethical perspective. The ethical perspectives of the following teacher educators have contributed to my own perspective and guided the formulation of many of the practical principles in this book.

First, according to the late Haim G. Ginott (1972) in *Teacher and Child: A Book for Parents and Teachers*, the teacher is responsible for creating a positive emotional climate for learning and can create such a climate through authentic, solution-oriented (rather than blame-oriented) communication. Some of the practical principles that derive from his work include the following:

- *A teacher should be strict about students’ behavior but permissive about their feelings.*
- *Instead of criticizing the actions of their students, teachers can safely express their anger by referring to their own feelings.*

Second, Alfie Kohn (2006a), in *Beyond Discipline: From Compliance to Community*, argues that it is better to foster a student’s maturity (e.g., moral development, interest in learning, willingness to cooperate, or self-control) than force his or her compliance. Some of the practical principles that derive from his work are as follows:
