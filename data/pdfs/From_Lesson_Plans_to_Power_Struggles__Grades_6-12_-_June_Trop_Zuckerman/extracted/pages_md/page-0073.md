was unanimous, this time a resounding yes. Since that day, I have had few if any problems with my sixth-period class.

Like Craig, Eliza had her students consider how their behavior affected others, her in particular. Not by enforcing a rule but by appealing to their sense of fairness, she elicited their commitment to treat her, and presumably the rest of the class, with politeness and respect. As a result, she, too, reshaped her class’s norms into those of a socially responsible learning community, an approach requiring patience but offering the promise of lasting benefits.

These 10 novice teachers’ stories present us with a continuum of effectiveness in managing the inevitable, a persistently noisy class. Their stories show us a progressive development from redefining themselves as a manager to assuming that power to effect an immediate strategy and finally to reshaping the class’s norms. Where are you on this continuum?

## Note to Craig’s and Eliza’s Stories: Creating a Caring Community

Rather than force compliance, Craig and Eliza each fostered their students’ moral development by giving them the opportunity to make an informed ethical choice and then assume responsibility for their behavior. Such a student-directed management system contributes toward creating a caring community of learners.
