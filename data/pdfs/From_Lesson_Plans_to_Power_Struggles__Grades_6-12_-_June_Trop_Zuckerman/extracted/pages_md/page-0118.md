# When You Have a Student Who Talks a Lot

Eight novice teachers each tried to cope with one or a few students whose talking during class disrupted the entire lesson. First, each teacher issued a series of pleas or warnings. What did the teacher do next, when that didn’t work?

In the first set of two stories, each teacher adopted a signal of disapproval. In the second set, each of the two teachers moved one or two students’ seats. In the third set, each of the three moved a student’s seat but also offered an opportunity for redemption.

Each of these teachers felt the strategy worked. The last story, however, is about a teacher who, alas, made a threat and then felt obliged to carry it out.

## Signaling Disapproval

### Steve’s Story

A couple of weeks ago, I used a technique that worked well for me. I had one student in the back of the classroom who loved to talk. Of course, his talking disrupted the whole back row, causing other students to engage in conversations ranging from local gossip to the final score of the Chicago Bulls game. Well, I knew I had to take care of the situation immediately, that it would only get worse if I didn’t.
