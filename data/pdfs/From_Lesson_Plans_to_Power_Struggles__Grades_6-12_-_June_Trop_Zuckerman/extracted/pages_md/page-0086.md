## Ariel’s Story

The first activity I planned for the ecology unit was a lab to study an ecosystem. In this lab, the students had to use a meter stick to measure 1 square meter of an ecosystem and then list all the populations they observed there. Before the lab, I introduced them to some concepts and the idea that organisms interact with each other and their environment.

The day before this lab, I had mixed feelings about taking this class of 27 students outside. What am I thinking of? But the next day, everything went as planned. The materials were ready for the students to use and the area was suitable for the activity. The students also understood that if they didn’t behave appropriately, they would have no other opportunities to work outside. Overall, I was pleased with the work they did and would be willing to take them out again.

How did Ariel promote the success of her lesson? Why was her lesson more successful than either Amy’s or Mandy’s? Why was the timing of Ariel’s warning more effective than the timing of either Mandy’s or, in Chapter 4, Tara’s?
