# When Students Fight

Classrooms are crowded places, order is fragile, and violence or the threat of violence can erupt suddenly. In the following two stories, Barney and Arthur each learn that novice teachers need eyes in the back of their head.

## Barney’s Story

During my study hall, I was helping one of my language arts students with his homework. I was oblivious to the rest of the study hall as I talked with him about character, plot, setting, and theme. But then I heard a loud noise. One boy was grabbing another by the shirt and pushing him to the floor between a row of tables. With a million things running through my mind, I sat there horrified for what seemed like an eternity. I thought, “I can’t break up this fight” and “What if the whole class jumps in? This is out of control.” I even thought about which of the two boys I liked better. Why would I think of something like that? I was stunned and didn’t know what to do.

After all these thoughts, I jumped up, puffed myself up like a blowfish, and charged toward them. I saw a stunning change in both of them almost immediately. They changed from giant gladiators into wide-eyed, 15-year-old boys. Then I said in my deepest voice, “Let it slide.”

The whole incident lasted only about half a second, but it seemed longer. They both sat down, and later in the period, they were laughing together once again.
