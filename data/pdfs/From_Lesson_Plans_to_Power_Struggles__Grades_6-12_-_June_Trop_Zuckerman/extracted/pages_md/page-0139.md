reflection, however, I think I should have spoken to him after class. Then I would have been better prepared to deal with him calmly.  

Both Gina and Colleen happened to overhear each of their student’s hostile remarks. Unlike Gina, Colleen took her student’s hostility personally, confronted him publicly, and continued to reprimand him, extending the scope of the reprimand even after he had apologized. Upon reflection, however, she realized she should have spoken to him after class, when her anger presumably would have subsided. *Teachers need to be the model of a rational, temperate, consistent, and positive adult, the only such model some of their students may ever see.*  

Colleen, instead of exacerbating his humiliation, could have helped him in class to save face. When she heard his remark, she could have explained, “Yes, I feel stupid today. I have such a bad cold. My ears are clogged, and my brain feels half dead. A cold is such a drag.” *Good discipline is achieved only through repeated kindnesses.*
