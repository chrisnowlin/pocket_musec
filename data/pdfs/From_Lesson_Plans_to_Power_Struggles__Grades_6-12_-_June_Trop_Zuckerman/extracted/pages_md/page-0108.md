## When You Have a Class Clown

A **class clown** is a student, usually male, who, through his antics, seeks to dominate class interactions in order to gain his classmates’ attention. The following *stories* each feature one of two strategies to mitigate the class clown’s disruptions. In the first two stories, Danny and Eric each dare the class clown to take center stage. In the last two, Ellen and Millie each push him off the stage.

### Daring the Class Clown to Take Center Stage

#### Danny’s Story

Five minutes into class, I was able to pick out the class clown. He made sure all the attention was on him. On any other day, I might not have minded so much, but this was my very first day. I knew that if I let him continue, I would never be able to control the class. I first asked him to settle down. This worked for about 30 seconds. Then he not only continued to tease some of the kids but started distracting me as well.

At this point, I was doing a demonstration for which I needed an assistant. Who better to choose? I asked for a volunteer while one of his arms happened to be raised. Having little choice, he came up to help me. Although he now had the entire class staring at him, this was not the kind of attention he wanted.
