# When Your Directions Generate Frustration

The first four stories in this chapter are about a novice teacher’s directions generating frustration and disorder. In the first of the four, the method of delivering the directions generates the students’ frustration. In the next three, the fault is with the directions themselves. The fifth story, however, is different. It raises this question: How can a novice teacher determine whether the students’ frustration is genuine or just a ruse to impede the progress of the lesson?

## The Delivery

### Melissa’s Story

The activity for the lesson was to make a moon wheel to demonstrate the cycle of the moon’s phases. A number of materials and several steps were involved in making the wheel. Each student was to cut out various pieces of paper and then glue one of them to a piece of cardboard. The other pieces of paper were then to be placed on top of the cardboard and fastened so each could rotate. The materials for each step were handed out when the entire class was ready for that step. The directions for that step were then given orally.

Unfortunately, I had enough scissors for only about half the students. Also, I didn’t allow the students to glue their own projects. Instead, I walked around the room and glued the paper for them.
