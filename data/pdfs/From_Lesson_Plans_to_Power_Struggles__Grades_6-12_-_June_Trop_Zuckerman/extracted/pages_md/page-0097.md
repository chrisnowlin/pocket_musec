# When There’s a Mishap

Two **novice teachers** each maintained their composure and resisted the tendency to be diverted from their lesson when a mishap occurred in their classrooms. Sally and Len each continued to be the model of a rational, temperate, consistent, and positive adult even under pressure.

## Sally’s Story

I imagine most novice teachers experience an embarrassing moment. I am no exception. I was writing notes on a transparency and projecting them for my seventh-period language arts class when the purple marker I was using exploded in my hand and leaked ink all over me, my clothes, the desk, and the floor.

These students are the first ones to laugh at someone else’s mistake or misfortune. So when the marker exploded, I just threw it away, grabbed another, and continued my lesson as if nothing had happened.

Continuing without explanation, Sally resisted the tendency to be diverted from her lesson. Fortunately, she had an extra marker. Like Sally, have handy, for both you and your students, extra supplies and equipment, such as markers, chalk, transparencies, paper towels, books, projector bulbs, and extension cords. And, like Sally, guard your instructional time. For every minute you divert your students from the course of your lesson, you will lose several times that amount trying to reengage them.
