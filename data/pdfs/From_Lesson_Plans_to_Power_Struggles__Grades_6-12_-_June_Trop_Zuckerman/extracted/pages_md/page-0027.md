## The Advantage of a Well-Planned, Activity-Based Lesson

The first three stories in this chapter are about how a well-planned, activity-based lesson engages students, thereby precluding the management problems that frustration and boredom can generate. In the fourth story, the teacher explains how he planned not only the activities but the very transition between them. A fifth story demonstrates how confusing directions and the careless distribution of materials can derail even a promising lesson.

### Ryan’s Story

In preparation for my biology class on competition within an animal population, I placed paper strips of various colors on the walls of the hall outside the classroom. Some were quite visible, such as a blue strip against a white wall, whereas others were more difficult to find, such as a red strip on a fire extinguisher. All of these strips represented food that the students, as members of an animal population, would need in order to survive.

Prior to the search, I gave the students a 10-minute lecture on hunting techniques used in the wild. Then I told them to bring back as many strips as they could find in the 8 minutes I would give them. Without necessarily realizing it, they used some of the techniques mentioned in the lecture. And as the students experienced the struggles animals face in their search for food, they realized that the competition for resources was intense.
