According to the transmission view of pedagogy, students learn by acquiring information as the teacher or text transmits it. Contemporary theorists, however, view learning as socially constructed. That is, students construct their own understandings as they relate new information to their prior knowledge and then modify or validate their understandings as they exchange ideas with others. Accordingly, to a social constructivist, a good lesson would feature pairs or small groups of students engaged in reflective discussion to reach common understandings.
