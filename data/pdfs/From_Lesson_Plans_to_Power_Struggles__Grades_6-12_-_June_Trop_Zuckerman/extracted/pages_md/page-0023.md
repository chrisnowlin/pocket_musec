# Acknowledgments

I am grateful to my husband, Paul R. Zuckerman, for supporting this project as he supports all my dreams and for simply and unfailingly believing in me.

I am also grateful to my former students who, as student teachers, trusted me with the stories of their failures and frustrations as well as their successes and satisfactions and who granted me permission to retell their stories so other novice teachers might benefit.

Last, I am grateful to my editors and reviewers at Corwin for their enthusiasm for and criticism of this work.
