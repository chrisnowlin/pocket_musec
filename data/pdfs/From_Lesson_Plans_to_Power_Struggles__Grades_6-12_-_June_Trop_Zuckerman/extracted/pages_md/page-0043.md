I anticipated a hesitant group that would come up with only a few body parts at best, but these students loved the activity. Before I knew it, the activity had kindled a competition with questions emerging from previously unresponsive students: “Can we use internal and external parts?” “Do hair and fingernails count?” These students were excited! They took an activity I thought would be boring, one that would seem trivial, and turned it into the basis for learning about the different kinds of cells.

Joe’s activity generated excitement because, far from being trivial, its level of difficulty was appropriate for his students. Accordingly, they believed they could be successful, so successful that they spontaneously competed with one another. Second, the activity related to his students’ everyday knowledge, in this case of their own body. Just as Peter used his students’ everyday knowledge of the Kaaterskill Creek to help them appreciate weathering and erosion, Joe used his students’ everyday knowledge of their own body to help them appreciate the different kinds of cells. *Students appreciate learning about a concept they can relate to everyday life*. How could you relate a concept you teach to your students’ everyday life?
