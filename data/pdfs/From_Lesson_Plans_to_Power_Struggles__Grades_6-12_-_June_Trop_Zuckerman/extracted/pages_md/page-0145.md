# When a Student Seems Troubled

Two **novice teachers** each face their own disappointment when dealing with a student who seemed troubled. If you too have been disappointed, consider whether your disappointment, like Harry’s and Mitchell’s, was based on an unrealistic expectation.

## Harry’s Story

When I started student teaching a few weeks ago, I saw that a certain boy had not been working well with my cooperating teacher. She explained that the boy had been disrespectful at the beginning of the school year, and when she addressed him about it, he got offended and remained distant.

Then, when I started working as a volunteer assistant coach for the track team, I got to see this boy in a different setting. As one of the runners, he seemed to connect with me. My cooperating teacher was impressed with the trust he seemed to have in me.

Any trust we might have shared ended this past week. He turned in an essay in which he had used several vulgar words. Shocked, I knew I had to speak to him about it. When I finally spoke to him, I told him he had to redo the assignment and was going to lose points.

I thought he would understand and accept this outcome graciously. Instead, he couldn’t understand what the big deal was. He has not resubmitted the essay and tries to make me uncomfortable with persistent sarcastic remarks. I guess I misjudged the relationship we had. I was disappointed, to say the least.
