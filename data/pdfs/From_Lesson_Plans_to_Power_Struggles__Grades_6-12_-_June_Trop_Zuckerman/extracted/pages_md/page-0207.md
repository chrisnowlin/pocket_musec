# Topical Index of Practical Principles

Note: The set of practical principles has been divided into five categories: Practical principles about (1) Building Relationships With Students, (2) Discipline, (3) Lesson Execution, (4) Lesson Planning, and (5) Teachers. A bold font, such as **P** for Preface, **C** for Conclusion, or the numeral for a particular chapter, follows each practical principle to indicate where in the book the principle is mentioned. Some principles have been assigned to more than one category.

A “working with” rather than a “doing to” approach promotes student maturity. 4, 7, 14, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28

Don’t be afraid to admit your mistakes. 12, 16, 19, 22

Enhancing chronically disruptive students’ feelings of significance might, over time, improve their behavior. 20

Honest communication is fundamental to your relationships with your students. 12, 19

Humor defuses tension and promotes a positive relationship with students but only when directed at the teacher or a situation, never at a student. 3
