# When Students Bully

Four **novice teachers** each believed that students must show their classmates respect, but none of them had confidence in their response to **bullying**, that is, a form of physical, psychological, or social violence in which a group or individual targets for abuse the person or property of another group or individual perceived as vulnerable.

## Vera’s Story

As my students were getting into groups to identify examples of different figures of speech, I noticed that one of the groups was excluding Holden. Holden is new to the school and has difficulty learning. The kids in his group were not only excluding him but making fun of him as well. I still don’t know exactly what they said to him, but I moved him to a different group right away.

Once I got him settled in his new group, I went over to the kids who had been disrespectful to him and said in a low, stern voice, “I will not tolerate your making fun of anyone in this classroom, and if you do it again, I will refer you for disciplinary action.” They knew I was serious.

I am not sure whether I was too harsh, but I remember being made fun of in junior high. I recall the incident and even the kids who made fun of me. I feel that too few teachers discipline students for that kind of behavior. I hope I never have to refer any of my kids, but I want them to know that they must show their classmates respect.
