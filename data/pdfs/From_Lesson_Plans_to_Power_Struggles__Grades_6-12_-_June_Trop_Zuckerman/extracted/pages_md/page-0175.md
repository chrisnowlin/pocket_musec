room when the class was in session. They could leave only before or after class or during the break.

During this particular class, she asked to go to the bathroom. When her request was denied, she sat back down in her chair and began voicing her displeasure. As I continued to teach the class, she got up from her seat and quietly walked in front of the class and out the door, probably to the bathroom. I continued with the lesson.

Several minutes later, she returned to her seat. I did not make a scene, but later that day, I wrote a referral for her insubordination. I assume she met with an administrator and the appropriate actions were taken. My colleagues agreed that I acted correctly. I was not drawn into a confrontation with her, and I kept her from distracting the class further. Since that time, she has not spoken to me about the referral, but she has not misbehaved either.

### How else could Theodore have managed the situation?
