a list of summarizing points individually and then swap their list with a classmate. Then he might have advanced his lesson and avoided the mire of discipline.

Matt’s response to their failure to heed his warnings was punishment. But punishment does not deter **misbehavior**; it fosters resentment, not cooperation. How could he have fostered their self-control instead?

## Audrey’s Story

As soon as I began the PowerPoint presentation, several students started talking. In order to advance the slides, I stood next to the SMART Board at the front of the room. When I stopped to pose a question, I instructed the students to take a minute to write down a response. Instead of following the directions, they simply started talking to one another. I tried calling the names of the students who were talking, but I got no response. The talking continued, and I began to feel helpless because I didn’t know how to regain their attention.

How could Audrey have held her students’ attention during her PowerPoint presentation? How could she have regained their attention?
