students’ sense of loss, she accepted their expressions of grief. First, she was flexible about conducting her lessons, knowing that under such a circumstance, her delaying the start of the lesson or postponing the test would hardly set a precedent. Second, she extended to her students the precious gift of listening.

Last, she followed her principal’s directions, permitting her students to visit a grief site rather than trying to be the counselor herself. A teacher’s role is complicated enough without trying to be a counselor, psychologist, or social worker. Teachers need to recognize and accept their limitations.

## Note: Students’ Feelings

Ginott (1972) explains that a teacher should allow students to express how they feel because, unlike behavior, people cannot control how they feel. Accordingly, he warns against a teacher’s belittling students’ feelings or otherwise responding in such a way as to cause them discomfort, guilt, embarrassment, or shame. Instead, he explains the importance of listening to students and responding authentically to them because “nothing defeats him [a teacher] more than phoniness” (p. 121).
