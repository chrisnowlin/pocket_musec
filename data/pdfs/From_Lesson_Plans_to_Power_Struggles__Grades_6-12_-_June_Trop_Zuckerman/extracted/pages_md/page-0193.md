managed to slip away each time.

“Yes, I’ll hold him.”

“You won’t forget now?”

“No, Mr. O’Leary. I promise.”

As I said, the class is a challenge. As dismissal time approached, I performed my usual routines, inspecting the floor to see that the trash had been picked up and that the chairs were perched on the tabletops for the custodian. The kids were lined up by the door in anticipation of my signal, and then, with my wave and nod, they were gone, all of them, including Cal.

I had completely forgotten my promise to Mr. O’Leary until he once again poked his head into my room, this time to collect Cal.

“Oh, no! I can’t believe it! I forgot to hold Cal. I am so sorry, so very sorry, Mr. O’Leary.”

To my relief, he said, “That’s all right, Gail. If Cal never does anything wrong again, he didn’t need the detention. And if he does, I’ll have another chance to get him.”

Given the challenges of this particular class, Gail could not overlap sufficiently to attend to Cal while executing her dismissal routines. She did, however, learn a valuable lesson from Mr. O’Leary that day, that *there’s always a tomorrow*, and in the meantime, she can *leave the problem at school*.
