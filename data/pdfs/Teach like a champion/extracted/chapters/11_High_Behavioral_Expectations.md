# Chapter **11**
## High Behavioral Expectations

A classroom must be orderly for learning to take place.

Some educators will take exception with that statement.

“Not at all,” they might say. “Learning is messy, chaotic, loud, and unpredictable. Disorder is part of education.”

But what they'd mean by disorder would be a classroom in which, after forty minutes of the frenetic building of suspension bridges with toothpicks and gumdrops, everyone cleaned up nicely and the teacher had a few moments to ask with a puckish grin: “Well, class, what have we learned?”

They'd mean a class where young people enthusiastically engaged in a ramshackle discussion with lively disagreement—about a book that everyone had read and had a copy of at the ready.

They wouldn't mean a classroom where it would take them ten minutes to get students to hear and follow directions for the bridge building or a classroom where students who raised their hand during the discussion risked violating powerful, unspoken social norms. Or where a student muttered and smirked every time the two girls in front of him spoke out loud. Or where they had to wonder what that student was saying under his breath to the girls.

What they would mean by disorderly would be just the right amount of untidiness and unpredictability when they'd chosen it, designed it, and delegated it. Order, in other words.

One of the core challenges of teaching is that it is very, very hard to create classrooms reliably characterized by psychological safety and where students encourage the best from one another; where, when necessary, students can think deeply amidst quiet and develop their capacity to pay attention; where some students' desire to pursue learning assiduously is honored and supported, even when others don't really feel like it.

It's far easier to say that order doesn't matter, or is counterproductive. It's easier to claim that a teacher's responsibility to be able to judiciously enforce quiet is the same as a craven desire to suppress student voices. It's easier to argue that the exercise of benevolent and necessary authority is a form of authoritarianism and to conflate those similar sounding but very different words. Establishing orderly classrooms is an ideal place for the Band-Aid Paradox.1

Democracy, in a classroom, is problematic when twenty-eight people want to learn chemistry and two want to persist in making hilarious burping noises. The twenty-eight do not require a mere majority to proceed. They need unanimity. One or two students' freedom to make those clever noises or to say no to the idea of listening and following directions is often a *de facto* decision for everyone else in the room. The lesson will not proceed as planned.

This is an age-old challenge but also one that is increasingly difficult to bridge. Our society is the most individualistic on the planet (adapting to its individualism is one of the biggest challenges for students who come here from other cultures) and it is growing more so by the moment. There are precious few times and places where people will accept that they must be willing to constrain their own behaviors and desires for the common good. This

used to be taken for granted; people were proud to do their part and raised their children to expect to as well, but no more. The refusal of some individuals to wear masks to help mitigate an epidemic, for example, underscores how hard it is to socialize such actions in our society. And yet schools are among the last institutions that ask for and depend on this increasingly unfamiliar behavior—where a greater common good (learning and knowledge for all) is achieved through small personal sacrifice (show, or perhaps even feign interest in what your classmates are saying even on days when you don't really feel like it).

At any given moment, the students in your classroom will be a mix of the stoic and the impulsive; the selfless and the selfish; the virtuous and the thoughtless; the wise and the silly.2 Hopefully more virtuous and wise than thoughtless and silly, but surely some of both. And in that mixture, the rights of those who dream of atoms and cell structure or insight into Grant's mindset as dawn broke over Vicksburg are fragile. They require protection. The more virtue and wisdom among the majority of your young people, the more imperative that you protect their right to learn in an optimal setting. And let me say a word here for the silly—of which I can say I was often one. Part of teaching is graciously and humanely preventing the puckishness of the child inclined to occasional silliness from becoming a bar to their own and others' learning. Short-sighted decisions by young people are to be expected. Everyone chooses hilarity over chemistry at some point. That such inclinations are natural and common does not mean that we should indiscriminately allow them, or that constraining them need be cruel or harsh—the opposite, in fact, and with skill such actions can feel like (and be) a form of caring. There is plenty of room for laughter at the right time.

The video *Emily Bisso: Write What I Write* tells a version of that story. Emily's class is taking notes. Except Joshua. He's

<!-- Page 728 -->

distracted and wants Emily's attention and is going to miss out on the learning. I'll unpack the details of her lovely interaction to get him back to learning later in the chapter, but it's not just her tone that expresses love and caring. It's the action itself. It will matter that Joshua learn the content of this lesson and learn to be a scholar if he is to thrive. To care about him is to get him back on track.

“It is not possible for everyone's desires to be met at the same time as everyone else's,” Tom Bennett reminds us in *Running the Room*. “At times individual wants will be balanced with the greater good of the community… . It is impossible for everyone to behave as they please.” This is to say that you cannot be a teacher and not be prepared to ask or require some students to sometimes do what they are not inclined to do. Doing so is the exercise of the responsibility we are entrusted with, not the abuse of authority.

And—here comes a summary of what this chapter is about—most of the tasks required of us to ensure the right kind and amount of order can be done warmly and graciously, in a caring manner and often with a smile. With skill they can be made less visible (in fact one of the main skills I try to point out in *technique 55, Least Invasive Intervention*, is making them as invisible as you can) and can be stripped of caustic emotions (*technique 56, Firm, Calm Finesse*). Or, even better, moments of conflict can be headed off and prevented before they even happen. Or many of them can. We cannot all achieve Emily Bisso's state of grace in the Joshua interaction; not every interaction can be solved quite so simply and happily. But the goal is to remember what Emily is telling us as much as what she is telling Joshua: *I do this because I care and in being attentive to my technique I am most able to do it in ways that help students thrive*. In fact, Emily's success is as much a result of her mastery of “quiet presence,” “economy of language,”

---

<!-- Page 729 -->

and “live in the now” (elements of *Strong Voice* I discuss later in the chapter, and of *Positive Framing*, which I discuss in the next chapter) as it is of her intention to be caring. Nobody takes this job because they want to shout at young people and have caustic interactions with them. But teachers by the thousand do so every day. They do so because the situations we are placed in as teachers are immensely challenging. They require more than good intentions to resolve optimally. They require technique. The grace that a teacher like Emily shows, we should all understand, is at least in part technique in disguise.

But before we go to technique it is necessary to establish that to excuse (or worse, justify) disorderly classrooms is to allow precious opportunity to be stolen from young people —usually the most vulnerable. Teachers are invested with authority to ensure that certain rights are protected precisely because those rights are preciously important and require everyone's cooperation to sustain. And teachers for the most part are insufficiently trained and prepared for this small but critical part of the job.

This is no small failing. A recent national survey of teachers³ found that *more than three quarters* (77 percent) believed that “most students suffered” because a few students were persistently disruptive. But of course, school problems, like everything else, are not evenly distributed in society. In schools with more than 75 percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches, more than half of teachers⁴ went further and said that “student behavior problems contributed to a disorderly or unsafe environment that made it difficult for many students to learn.” For those who might be wondering, the authors also disaggregated the results by race of teacher and found few differences. On the question of whether student behavior “contributed to a disorderly or unsafe environment that made it difficult for many students to learn,” for example, Black teachers

---

<!-- Page 730 -->

said yes at roughly the same rate as White teachers: 60 percent for Black teachers to 57 percent for White teachers. The issue, in other words, does not appear to be White teachers seeing harmless behavior among kids of color and reading danger and defiance where none exists, although, of course, we should always be aware that this is a risk. The data suggest that the issue is that almost every student assigned to a school not characterized by economic privilege is consigned to spend a significant portion of their learning years in classrooms where a lack of order makes it difficult for them to learn.

That is the norm.

Additionally, students themselves feel unsafe much of the time in school. A 2018 study by the United Negro College Fund reported that fewer than half of African American students (43 percent) feel safe at school.⁵ Think for a moment about the enormity of that finding—feeling unsafe is *normal*—it is how the average Black student feels in school, according to the survey. And those data are not disaggregated to show the disparate impact on Black students in high poverty schools, specifically.

Parents, not surprisingly, worry too. Another report by UNCF found that parents prioritized a safe, secure, and violence-free environment as the most important single factor when choosing a school for their child.⁶

Given that effective schools are the single most important vehicle in society for ensuring equality of and access to opportunity, these data represent a massive and regressive tax on families of poverty. But it is not just egregious behavior that is a problem. Low-level disruptions are chronic in many classrooms and result in not only lost learning time but disruption of student focus. A report by the UK Government in 2013–2014 found such behaviors as calling out without permission, talking unnecessarily while

---

<!-- Page 731 -->

the teacher was teaching, being slow to start work or follow directions, showing lack of respect for peers or teacher, not arriving to class with necessary materials, and using mobile devices to be chronic problems in many classrooms. “The findings in this report are deeply worrying,” Her Majesty's Chief Inspectorate wrote, “not because pupils' safety is at risk ... but because this type of behavior has a detrimental impact on the life chances of too many pupils. It can also drive away hard-working teachers from the profession.”7

And yet, there is still more to the story. Unnecessary suspensions are a chronic problem in schools and they, too, can have cascading consequences for students who are suspended—they miss class and fall further behind; they are then more likely to drop out of school or become further disengaged. That said, permitting the behaviors that lead to suspension should not be an option, for reasons reflected in the data mentioned earlier. At least two steps are central—and often overlooked—in addressing this challenge. The first is that schools must become more inclined to use teaching as a response when students are disruptive. To that end, my colleague Hilary Lewis has developed a Dean of Students' curriculum, for example. It offers robust and productive lessons that provide replacement behaviors and opportunities for developing knowledge and sustaining reflection in place of mere punishment when students behave in a disruptive or counterproductive manner.8 The other step is for teachers to develop the capacity to prevent issues from escalating to the point where students require such disciplinary measures. Calmly and efficiently resolving the natural tensions that arise in the classroom is a core skill of a master teacher. Prevention and deescalation are almost always preferable to a post-event response, no matter how good.

---

<!-- Page 732 -->

There is a tendency among some educators to equate orderly classrooms with higher rates of suspension and other harsh disciplinary consequences, but in fact the opposite is the case. Norms are the most pervasive influence on the behaviors of individuals. Students are more likely to engage in more extreme behaviors in environments in which those behaviors appear plausible or even common, where things spiral quickly out of control, where there is little learning going on, where there is peer pressure to test limits, and where the culture does little to check this impulse. Sadly, when this is the case, students often feel tacit pressure to engage in behaviors they don't especially want to do and know are wrong. Every principal will tell you that some portion of suspensions are of young people who lack a positive and productive relationship to school, and some portion are of kids who like school and want to succeed there and nonetheless do something dangerous, stupid, or mean-spirited in a way that seems utterly out of character. A teacher who can use the tools in this chapter to establish a warm, caring, and humane learning environment that offers consistent limits is engaged in the work of preventing suspensions.

There is a final element to an orderly classroom that is also easily overlooked. “Self-discipline, self-regulation, hard work, [and] patience,” Tom Bennett writes in *Running the Room*, are all “enormously important characteristics of successful people in a variety of contexts… . Everything of value you can conceive of was acquired through sustained effort, practice, and delayed gratification.” An orderly classroom builds these habits—you want to speak but you discipline yourself to listen first; you are tired some days but complete your tasks regardless.

Productive and positive behavior, in other words, is part of an invisible curriculum in schools that reinforces executive functioning skills and allows students to thrive. Students

<!-- Page 733 -->

learn to understand how to work within the parameters of a group or organization. Young people who are rude to teachers and classmates and who talk back and struggle to embrace common goals “are not going to magically transform themselves into prime candidates for the best jobs” or into collaborative members of the project team, observes Jo Facer in *Simplicity Rules*. To learn those things is to be ready to start your own business, raise children, or be the sort of valued colleague who brings greatness to a team or project.

And just because we teach students to understand how to work within the parameters of a group or organization “does not mean they cannot push back intellectually,” Facer continues. Learning to be a productive member of a group does not prevent you from taking political or social action in the face of unjust broader societal norms. Students who have been in well-run classrooms have not been “socialized to be compliant.” I do not buy the argument that if you call out in class and don’t follow your teacher’s direction you are learning independent thought and a commitment to justice. Or that co-opting productive meetings and being inattentive to the needs of the group is preparing for leadership. Conflating schools without rules as crucibles of liberation proposes a fairly unrealistic vision of what civil disobedience and organized dissent entail. There are actually a fairly large number of meetings required to organize groups and clarify goals. Better to have learned to clearly express your ideas, to learn how to work within group norms. Such students remain empowered to stand up to injustice when doing so is warranted and in fact have more tools to do so when required—a good education teaches students many things, including the history and tools of resistance to injustice.

This causes me to return to the phrase “productive and positive” behavior, which I used previously. That phrase

---

<!-- Page 734 -->

reminds us that the purpose of these techniques is not so much to forestall negative behavior as it is to socialize positive and productive behaviors that help young people thrive in all the settings of their lives. Our goal is to create something good, and one outcome will be the prevention of the negative behaviors along the way.

## TECHNIQUE 52: WHAT TO DO

Giving directions is one of the most overlooked aspects of teaching both because of its mundanity and its familiarity. We are forever doing it but it feels about as profound as ordering a sandwich.

But poor directions—those that are unclear or meandering (which is to say unclear and compounded by length and repetition)—have consequences that are far-reaching. For example:

- My directions aren't clear, so some students don't follow through on them and we waste time.
- My directions aren't clear, so some students do the task incorrectly and are confused.
- My directions aren't clear, so some students are confused, and I get mad at them for not doing what I wanted. They feel my sense of frustration and are frustrated in return.
- My directions aren't clear, so students assume I'm flustered or not prepared or am not really all that clear on what I want.
- My directions aren't clear, so some enterprising student takes advantage of the gray area and pretends to misunderstand by doing something else entirely. Wouldn't that be funny!

---

<!-- Page 735 -->

Turns out giving effective directions is one of teaching’s core competencies and *What to Do* is the art of giving directions effectively. It is a case study in little things with big consequences.

The most basic version of poor directions occurs when teachers tell students what *not* to do. Let me offer a few examples:

> “Kevin, you shouldn't be looking out the window.”  
> “Cheryl, don't get distracted.”  
> “Class, don't hand me messy disorganized work.”

Now let me rewrite them to show how they might be different (acknowledging that a master teacher would probably make them far better):

> “Kevin, make sure you're getting everything on the board into your notes.”  
> “Cheryl, please turn to Carly and share your thoughts about the beginning of *Chapter Two*.”  
> “Class, make sure your decimals are lined up, you write neatly, and circle your final answer.”

In each of these cases, the revision is likely to help students be successful because it describes specific, concrete, and observable actions. When there are multiple steps, they are in a clear sequence.

**Specific Directions.** Effective directions break down larger tasks into manageable steps that students can take. I could have corrected “don't hand me messy or disorganized work” with “make sure your work is neat and organized,” for example. That might be fine. But it's a bit of an assumption that students know what it means to do neat and organized work. And even if they do, a reminder

---

<!-- Page 736 -->

always helps. So breaking the task apart into more specific steps is, in a sense, teaching students the component steps of organization.

You can get a sense for how clear and specific directions help students succeed and engage productively in the work of class in the video *Denarius Frazier: Check in with Your Neighbor*. The incipient sense of flow, the way Denarius is building a sense of uninterrupted focus and momentum, derives from his simple clear directions coming out of the *Do Now*—“Pencils down and track me”—and to start the *Turn and Talk*: “Go ahead and check in with your neighbor. You have thirty seconds. Go.” Crisp and clear and all but impossible to misinterpret. Or watch the moment at the beginning of the video *Gabby Woolf: Keystone*. “We're going to be reading the beginning of [Chapter Four](#),” Gabby notes and students look placidly back at her. Then she adds a clear and specific direction: “Have your text in front of you, please.” Notice how many students suddenly swing into action and get their books. Notice how many students didn't think to have their books ready and how much unproductive learning time has been avoided by the simple clarity of that small phrase inserted at the outset of the activity.

**Concrete Directions.** Effective directions involve, when possible, clear, actionable tasks that students know how to execute. It's not just that the direction about neat and organized work breaks it into clear and manageable steps but that the steps are concrete enough to be hard to misinterpret. They refer to things like lining up decimals rather than “carefully presented work.” The former is much more concrete and ideally, I'd have taught students to line up decimals, so they knew exactly what I meant and were likely to be successful. Same for my direction to Cheryl, who, let's assume, is missing out on a *Turn and Talk* and is distracted or perhaps turned around and trying to get the

---

<!-- Page 737 -->

attention of someone else in class. Cheryl, *please start the Turn and Talk* would tell her what to do, but it's vague. In other words, what do I mean by that? Cheryl might misunderstand. Though many readers will probably come up with even better examples, I've tried to “shrink the change” as Chip and Dan Heath describe it in *Switch*. I've made the first step easier to follow by making it clearer and smaller.

You can see how Sadie McCleary's specific and concrete directions to her chemistry class help every student to get ready simply and easily in the video *Sadie McCleary: Notes for Today*. Sadie has taught students how to head a paper to take notes on so when she says, “Today is lesson 14,” they understand that this is what they should write at the top of their notes under the phrase “Unit 2: Matter,” which they've already written at the top. Notice how specific she is even about what exactly they should write. In addition to ensuring they are ready to take notes, this signals her own careful preparation to students.

**Sequential Directions.** I mentioned earlier that effective directions should describe a sequence of concrete, specific actions. This allows you to pace them: If there are a series of steps and a student is inclined to distraction, you might parse them out more slowly or even one by one, checking for completion or at least progress on one before naming the next. I learned this as a parent when my children were small. There might be days when I could say: OK, towel off, get your jammies on, and brush those teeth successfully. There were also days when that many directions at once would end in disaster. If one of my kids was getting out of the tub and feeling giddy or distracted, I would pace the directions. I'd start: OK. Get your towel and dry off. When that was done, I'd say: Great. Now get into your jammies. When that was done, I'd say, Good, now over to the sink to brush your teeth. So you might pace your directions to

---

<!-- Page 738 -->

Cheryl if you weren't sure of her mindset and the likelihood of her follow-through. *Cheryl, turn and face Carly. Good, please give her a bit of eye contact so she knows you're listening. OK, now share your thought or ask her what she thought.*

Jason Brewer does a really nice job of pacing his sequential *What to Do* directions for a different reason in the video *Jason Brewer: Pencils Are Down*. He wants to give students time to finish each task in his directions well, without rushing, so he parses them one by one with lots of space in between and with a calm and easy voice.

**Observable Directions.** The more observable you make a direction the more you can assess follow-through and, if necessary, reinforce accountability for a student who's confused, distracted, or not especially inclined to follow through at the moment. Telling a student to “pay attention” is the classic counterexample. It's non-observable. So if I tell Caleb to pay attention and in my estimation he does not improve and I say, “Caleb, I asked you to pay attention,” he would likely reply, “But I was paying attention,” either because he believed he was or because he was seeking to avoid responsibility. But if my directions were observable: “Caleb, pick up your pencil and take notes in the space at the top of your paper,” and Caleb continued to struggle, I could first say, “Caleb, pick up your pencil please,” and watch for his follow-through, pacing my further directions from there based on his response. It's much harder to sustain an “I did pick up my pencil” argument when your pencil is not in your hand than it is to sustain an “I was paying attention” argument. Now Caleb's lack of follow-through is clear and unambiguous so if I must respond with a consequence of some sort, it will be clear—to me and to him—that it is justified.

---

<!-- Page 739 -->

In the video *Arielle Hoo: Eyes Up Here*, Arielle's *What to Do* directions—impeccable, clear, warm, and gracious—always start with an observable direction: “Eyes up here” or “Track up here.” This allows her to scan for follow-through and attention and make sure students hear all the math. She combines her WTD directions with several exceptional examples of technique 53, Radar and Be Seen Looking.

## Keys to Effective Delivery with *What to Do*

**Economy of Language:** Maybe the most useful piece of advice for making *What to Do* directions effective is to use as few words as possible. More words often make the necessary task less clear or more ambiguous. You might think economy of language would make you sound stern, but of course crispness can be done with grace and warmth, as the clip *Tamesha McGuire: Baseline* beautifully demonstrates. Tamesha's directions are: “Tuck your chairs,” “Pencils up,” and “Write your name.” The longest has three words, which helps her kindergartners to get happily to work and gives her lots of time to circulate and share the warmth instead of offering repeated reminders. This is especially important with your first direction. You can see that play out in *Denarius Frazier: Try That Grid*, in which Denarius's directions sound much like Tamesha's: “In pairs.” “Two minutes.” “You do one.” “Try that grid, fill in all the blanks that you can.” The crispness and clarity of the first two directions earns students' attention and focus.

A second key to success is to use **Emotional Constancy**, that is to deliver directions and corrections in an even tone, even if you are feeling a little frazzled or frustrated, so students focus on and respond to your

---

<!-- Page 740 -->

words, not your emotions. That's pretty evident in all the examples we've seen so far. There's no tension to distract students from the task at hand.

Consistent **What to Do:** Use consistent language as often as you can so the directions themselves are a sort of routine in and of themselves. For example, always saying “Pencils in the tray” often works better than an unpredictable combination of “Pencils in your trays,” “Pencils in their homes,” “Pencils down,” “Put your pencils down,” “Let’s put those pencils away,” and so on. You don’t have to be obsessive about it but increasing the consistency of the language in your directions allows you to make the direction more like a habit. This frees you up to focus on your lesson and makes it easier for students to do what you’ve asked. Part of the reason Denarius’s class starts so smoothly is that he is consistent about the phrase he uses to close the Do Now nearly every day. It’s almost always “Pencils down and eyes up here” or something very similar. If there are moments when you most want follow-through, use the most familiar version of the direction.

Giving a **What to Do Out Front,** that is, in advance of a cue to begin, is a great way to make sure students hear all of your directions and aren’t distracted as you give them. For example, saying, “When I say ‘go,’ please turn to your partner and discuss your observations about the beginning of the chapter,” gives you the opportunity to make sure everyone has heard the direction and is attentive and to add further detail—“I’ll ask a few of you to share your partner’s observation”—before students rush off to Turn and Talk. If your class is especially enthusiastic and it’s a task they’re excited to do, you might even say, “When I say ‘go,’ but not before I say ‘go,’ please turn to your

---

<!-- Page 741 -->

partner and discuss your observations …” This also, by the way, makes a crisper and more visible start to the *Turn and Talk*, and norms that are more visible are more likely to become universal quickly.

On the other hand, you may notice the directions in *Arielle Hoo: Eyes Up Here*, where she says, “Eyes up here in four … three … two …” She’s given her *What to Do* but also given a countdown to students before the cue so they have a bit of time and space and can finish what they are writing.

## Simplified What to Do

If a student does not respond to your *What to Do* direction, simplify it, either by removing words, requesting an even more concrete action, or reducing the number of steps you’ve asked the student to follow through on. For example, if you say to a student, “Pick up your pencil and take notes at the top of the page,” and she doesn’t do it, you might say, “Pick up your pencil, please.” If you still don’t get follow-through, you might point to the pencil. “Pencil in your hand, please, Roberta.” Breaking down directions makes it easier to teach and reinforce your expectations for how students should complete a task.

What about when your direction is explicitly in response to a student who needs redirection? Adapting *What to Do* to the type of situation—and your assessment of its possible causes—can help ensure success in terms of both the task getting done and relationships being preserved.

**Standard:** The cause of poor follow-through is unclear and could plausibly be benign, such as distraction or confusion:

*Assume the Best:* “Hmm, I must not have been clear. When we are in ‘Learner’s Position,’ that means our

---

<!-- Page 742 -->

voices are off.”

**Act As If:** After delivering a *What to Do* correction, glance away as if you're sure that they'll follow through. Then use a confirmation glance as needed to monitor.

**Ambiguous:** The cause of poor follow-through is unclear, but it has been persistent or seems like it could include some taking advantage of gray area.

  *Simplify:* Remove words, choose just one step.

  *Emotional Constancy:* Double-check that you are calm and steady; remove emotional variables.

**Challenging:** The cause of poor follow-through appears to be deliberate or limit-testing. Behavior is repeated or the situation is especially challenging.

  *Shrink the Change:* Break the next step down into the smallest possible task. For example, you say to a student, “Stand up at your desk and walk to the door, please,” but she doesn't do it. You say, “Stand up at your desk, please.” She still doesn't do it. You say, “Push your chair back. Good. Now stand up. Thank you.”

  *Insert Careful Acknowledgments:* When a student is in a negative cycle, help them perceive each productive step back toward the path to success by acknowledging it in a muted tone. For example, a dean of students dealing with an upset student might say: “Please sit in this chair” very calmly and then add “thank you” (with very little affect) when the student has done it. Then perhaps: “Please turn and face me so I know you're ready to discuss this.” As soon as it happens, the dean might acknowledge that the student is making an effort: “That’s much better. Thank you.” Then he or she might try, “Now

---

<!-- Page 743 -->

when you're ready to talk, please give me a nod.” Again you might acknowledge with, “Thank you,” perhaps adding “I appreciate you showing me you’re ready to talk about this. I appreciate that.”

# Online Lessons: Remote *What to Do*

The importance of directions is critical—and critically overlooked—in most settings. Teaching remotely caused many of us to confront the challenges of clarity in this new setting. With glitchy Internet and an increased potential for distractions, with the difficulty of pairing nonverbal cues with directions and the fact that teachers’ directions suddenly were given in a tiny voice emanating from a window in the corner of a screen, it was many times easier for students to miss a direction online. And of course the safety net that has existed for students for time immemorial—if you don’t know what to do, look at what the people next to you are doing—also disappears when you are sitting alone at your kitchen table.

Under such conditions teachers learned a thing or two about giving directions.

One of our favorite videos was this one of Alonzo Hall’s “orientation screen” at the beginning of his lesson. His verbal directions are also given visually, with absolute clarity and absolute simplicity so they are much harder to miss or misunderstand. *Here’s what to do*, they say, with the most important parts highlighted in yellow.

## Let’s Get Organized!

And here's Eric Snider making the directions for independent work both visual and oral and *leaving a version of them up for students to reference throughout the activity* so they can always reorient.

**Independent Work until 1:30**

- [ ] 1. Read pages 195-199. It's finally the girls' time to perform! Find out what happens and be ready for... a plot twist.
- [ ] 2. Answer questions 4-6 in classwork.
- [ ] 3. Take Socratic Quiz.
- [ ] 4. Make sure **ALL** questions are answered then → “Turn In” Classwork.
- [ ] 5. Begin IR for your reading log. We will come back together at **1:30**

**What Alonzo and Eric are doing ties in to cognitive science.** “Spoken words disappear,” Oliver Caviglioli points out in his book on the science of visuals, *Dual Coding*. This is called the **Transient Information Effect** and it reminds us that anything that is exclusively verbal is harder to study and remember and often exerts a heavy load on working memory. This has instructional implications but also cultural ones: we should put reminders everywhere if we want people to remember.

**But our reminders should be simple!** Limiting extraneous information is another piece of advice Caviglioli provides about visuals. Graphics are most useful when spare and focused: simple and without extraneous info; for example, fewer colors are better and line drawings are often better than photos if we want people to focus on the content and process the key ideas.

# TECHNIQUE 53: RADAR AND BE SEEN LOOKING

In technique 52, *What to Do*, I shared a video of Arielle Hoo giving directions to her math class (*Arielle Hoo: Eyes Up Here*). She’s a model of clarity and her students respond beautifully, working attentively, thoughtfully, and contentedly.

You can get an even clearer sense of the culture of Arielle's room in the video *Arielle Hoo: Keystone*, taken from the same lesson. Notice two very simple but very important things she does after giving her directions: “Eyes up here in four … three …”

I've cut and pasted a series of still shots taken from the video here and numbered them one through four to show what she does a little more clearly:

---

<!-- Page 747 -->

The first thing Arielle does is to look. She gives her directions and, instead of looking down at her notes or at the board, she takes a second to scan the room, right to left. This lets her confirm that students are following her directions. If they're not, she'd want to adjust. Perhaps she wasn't clear enough and she'd want to regive her directions with a bit of assuming the best: “Whoops, let me be a little clearer… .” Perhaps they're a little giddy and she'll want to slow her voice slightly to set a calmer tone. For sure, she won't want to push on too fast if students are showing signs of distraction. Either way, the lesson is that a teacher can manage only what she sees so actions that allow you to see more clearly and comprehensively are critical. Actions that allow teachers to see well constitute a critical set of skills and one that is too rarely talked about. I call such actions *Building Radar*.

To return to Arielle's classroom, and her glance up at her class to see whether they've followed through, what her action tells students in that moment is at least as important as what she learns from looking. Her message is: I care whether you do what I asked. I will notice whether you do so or not. When we show that it matters to us, it matters more to students. Just by looking, and having students know that we look, we make it more likely that they will follow through; perhaps in part because we've eliminated some gray area, but more likely because we've simply shown that it matters. If you have a strong relationship with students, this will be profoundly influential. If you are still building it, the clarity and competence you show will help earn their trust and respect.

A brief digression here before I return to the second thing Arielle does. Watch the very short video of fourth-grade teacher Katie Kroell (*Katie Kroell: Sacrifice*). She's an excellent teacher but I've chosen this clip mostly because it is a study of human nature. Notice the young man in the

left foreground. He's getting something out of his backpack. It could be anything, honestly: an extra pencil or something he wants to show a classmate. About ten seconds into the video, Katie glances in his direction:

She doesn't do anything else. She doesn't nod her head or wag her finger or frown. It's actually not even clear how she feels about what the student is doing. She merely looks

---

<!-- Page 749 -->

and he decides of his own volition not to get whatever it was out of his backpack. It's his choice, but his choice changes because he knows his teacher is aware of it. *I don't need that right now.* When people know others are aware of what they are doing, they become more aware of their own choices and they choose differently. This is true almost everywhere in our lives. There's a street near my house where a device on the roadside shows your speed as you drive past. It doesn't take a picture. There are no consequences. It simply tells you how fast you are going. And yet every driver I have ever driven behind slows down.⁹

That's part of what's happening in Arielle's classroom. When students know that their teacher sees and cares whether they follow a direction, they are suddenly much more likely to follow it.

And this brings me to the second thing Arielle does. She exaggerates her looking ever so slightly so students will be more aware of it. You can see this best in the photos. She lifts her chin in a tiny bit of pantomime. *See me looking?* This enhances the effect of the preventive benefits of looking, especially for students who are least likely to notice without the extra emphasis. I call this idea *Be Seen Looking*. Looking is most effective when students are aware of it, so we can help them become more aware of it via subtle nonverbal actions and thus prevent behaviors that would require correction. It's a gift to everybody.

To go back to the photo from Katie's classroom, it's worth asking whether her student would have seen her questioning glance if she hadn't, like Arielle, lifted her chin slightly to make her looking more legible to her student.

Let's call that move *Chin Up* to make it easy to remember and replicate. And while we're at it, let's call a deliberate scan from one side of the room—to build a habit of looking

---

<!-- Page 750 -->

well—a *Swivel*. *Radar*’s foundation is the *Swivel*—the deliberate scan of the classroom that causes you to be sure to see as much as you can. It takes only a second or two. Ideally it would become a habit—you’d give directions and scan without even really thinking to do it.<sup>10</sup> It looks like it’s a habit for Arielle—her mind is on other things as she scans. But it helps her keep everyone positively engaged and defends against blind spots. And if she sees something small she can redirect it simply and quickly while it’s still small. The idea of catching things early while they’re tiny so the fix can also be tiny is called “catch it early.” It’ll come up later in this chapter. But to catch it early you have to see it early. So you have to look systematically.

You can observe Arielle responding to what her *Swivel* reveals when she says, “Waiting on two.” As we’ll discuss in a few pages this is called an anonymous individual correction. It lets students know she’s aware they’re a bit behind while preserving their anonymity. In this case they quickly catch up. A potential problem is averted.

You also might notice that Arielle takes a half step back when she scans. It’s the equivalent of stepping back when you are taking a photograph to get everyone in the frame. It allows her to see more of the class with less of a *Swivel*, and it reminds us that where you stand is a major factor in what and how well you see.

Julia Addeo’s *Swivel* is especially good. It’s a critical part of her transition about two minutes into her keystone. “Just one piece of feedback. Track up here,” she says to make sure students who were working on their problem set now attend to the discussion. She’s at the overhead projector and can’t afford to move to a new spot. Perhaps because of this she scans left to right and then back to the left, making it clear without any words that their focus is critical and

---

<!-- Page 751 -->

matters to her. Her students recognize this and seconds later she's teaching to a locked-in room of thirty.

The video Denarius Frazier: Keystone shows Denarius using a Swivel to scan the room several times. The clearest and best example occurs at about 10:20 because his range of motion is relatively narrow. That's because he's taken an even more intentional approach to the question of where to stand. When you stand in the corner of the room you dramatically reduce the field of vision you have to scan and otherwise manage. This makes it simpler to see everything. I call this position Pastore's Perch, after the first teacher I observed using it consistently and intentionally, Patrick Pastore.

You can see math teacher Rodolfo Loureiro standing consistently in Pastore's Perch to see better in Rodolfo Loureiro: Fix Your Mistakes. Each time he gives a direction he walks to the corner of his room and observes from there. This makes it easy for him to see whether students follow through. The movement to the corner also probably makes it clearer to students that he's looking and that it's time for task completion. The combination of these two effects allows Rodolfo to relax and smile warmly. Bonus points to Rodolfo for using different corners so he sees different students with more clarity each time and is in tune with how everyone is doing.

Here's a quick graphic that demonstrates the importance of Pastore's Perch. To see the classroom from the front center you have to scan a field of about 150 degrees. That's a lot to see, but scan carefully and pay special attention to the blind spots in the corners of the visual field. However, if you walk to the corner of your room, you can see the whole room by scanning a visual field of just 80 degrees. It's now simpler to scan.

80°

Eyes up here, Please.

**Be Seen Looking** is the yin to **Radar**’s yang. One is seeing well, and the other is contriving ways to subtly remind students that you see them.

In *Marisa Ancona: Pens to Paper*, you can see Marisa doing this even before class has started. Notice how industriously her students get settled and ready for class. In large part this is because she puts such value on it. She is visibly watching, steadily and calmly with a bit of **Chin Up**, and making her way from one corner of the room to the other the whole time. What the teacher shows she values, students are more likely to value, and Marisa demonstrates how much she values student focus without saying a word.

Watching the various unspoken pantomimes teachers use to ensure that their students notice them looking, my colleagues on the TLAC team began to give humorous and lighthearted names for the most common among them.

---

<!-- Page 753 -->

They include the *Swivel* and the *Chin Up* described earlier in addition to the *Sprinkler*, an adaptation of the *Swivel* wherein a teacher starts to Swivel then momentarily doubles back midstream in the direction she'd just scanned as if to say, momentarily, “Oh, I think I just saw something. No. Everything is OK.” It makes the deliberateness of the scan more visible. We called it the *Sprinkler* because someone in the room noticed that it looked like the 1980s dance move of the same name, and the gag was on. We started to give dance names to all the *Be Seen Looking* moves. Here are a few more of our favorites:

**The Invisible Column:** A teacher moves his head slightly to the side after giving a direction as if he's trying to look around something (an invisible column). You can see Rodolfo Loureiro model his version of this timeless move in the video *Montage: Be Seen Looking*.

**The Tiptoes:** A teacher stands for a moment on her tiptoes while looking out at the room, as if she's just making doubly sure everything is OK in some hard-to-see spot in the room. Kirby Jarrell models an especially impressive version of this in the video *Montage: Be Seen Looking*.

**The Disco Finger:** A teacher traces the track of her gaze in a *Swivel* with her finger outstretched, pointer style, like one of the killer disco moves you haven't dusted off in a decade or two. It intimates, *Let me just check all of these places* and makes the Swivel obvious to those who are least likely to notice it. Tamesha McGuire takes this to the next level with her kindergartners in the video *Montage: Be Seen Looking*. Obviously, her goal here is to make her action especially visible to her little ones. Just a hint of disco finger, low, subtle, perhaps with your finger about at

---

<!-- Page 754 -->

your midriff is probably the trick for your eighth graders.

**The Politician:** A teacher acts like an aspiring office holder who walks onstage before a big speech and points in recognition to all of her apparent friends and supporters in the audience—one over here, one over there. As a teacher, you send a similar upbeat message of “I see you all out there” when you gesture briefly to the folks in the audience who are similarly demonstrating that they are with you. The irrepressible Darren Hollingsworth models a useful version of this move in the video *Montage: Be Seen Looking* and you can see Patrick Pastore doing his version there as well —while standing in Pastore's Perch, no less.

**The QB:** A teacher moves like an NFL quarterback (QB) who, crouching behind the center, gazes quickly at the defense. Just because he's low doesn't mean he's not going to scan. Similarly, as champion teachers crouch to confer with a scholar, they flash their eyes briefly across the room, to make sure they see the field. Kathryn Orfuss isn't conferencing with a student in her clip in the video *Montage: Be Seen Looking*—she's at the overhead projector—but it gives you a good sense for how to look up and glance proactively when you're doing something else.

To summarize, not looking for follow-through after we give a direction can suggest that we don't notice or don't care whether students follow through on our directions, but doing the reverse—showing that we care that they do what we asked—is actually a very strong positive incentive for most students.

<!-- Page 755 -->

# TECHNIQUE 54: MAKE EXPECTATIONS VISIBLE

As a rule of thumb, the more visible the action you ask students to execute, the easier it is for you to see whether students follow through, and the more that students implicitly recognize that you can clearly see what they do. This makes them more likely to do what you've asked and makes it easier for you to hold them accountable. Some of the most effective teachers have a way of making “observable directions” fun and tactile, increasing both the incentive to follow through and their ability to manage.

A colleague of mine, David McBride, used this idea to help a teacher who was struggling at the time to keep students focused. Drawing on *Radar* and *Be Seen Looking*, David asked the teacher to script three points into his lesson when he would give a clear task and ensure that he got 100 percent of students doing it, even if at first this was only temporary. He wanted to start by showing the teacher that students would and could follow his directions; that a room where everyone was productively engaged was within his reach.

David asked him to:

- Give an observable direction.
- Use *Radar* to scan intentionally and strategically to see whether it's being done.
- Stand in Pastore's Perch while scanning.
- Narrate the follow-through of at least two students who've done right away what the teacher has asked.
- Warmly correct at least one student if students were not meeting expectations.

---

<!-- Page 756 -->

David called this a “reset” and it worked in some cases, but in others it was less helpful because the teacher didn't always see off-task behaviors. So David changed his guidance to emphasize making expectations visible.

“I want you to choose an especially visible direction. Something you know students will know you can see them do. Substitute ‘Pencils down and eyes on me’ for ‘Eyes on me,’ for example, and then look for that as you scan.”

The results were dramatic. Students putting their pencils down were ten times more visible to the teacher than was fleeting and hard-to-gauge eye contact. It was easier to see who was following through as asked. Not only that, but students sensed the increased clarity implicit in the new directions.

It was evident to them that it would be obvious to the teacher whether they followed through. There were a few challenging kids in the group but there was a far larger number of students who had begun to sense that not doing as the teacher asked was a bit of a game in this classroom—a challenge to see if they could not do as the teacher asked without him noticing. Soon, playing that game had become a norm. There were games the kids played at recess and to play them was to be in the club. A version of that had started to emerge in the classroom, too.

But suddenly, with the gray era eliminated, a larger number of students who had not been following through consistently began to change their behavior. The norm suddenly shifted. The challenging kids were still there but suddenly they were few and far between. There had been one or two bold rebels who induced those around them to follow them in testing the teacher but suddenly the rebels had no followers. It was a case study in the Heath Brothers' observation that the size of the problem does necessarily correlate with the size of the solution.

---

<!-- Page 757 -->

This story of a classroom reinvigorated, and a teacher saved—he was at the point of giving up—began with making a simple direction more visible and thereby eliminating ambiguity. Follow-through is easier to manage and monitor when directions ask students to do something visible. If you can see it, you can manage it.

Here are a few more examples of how you might make expectations more visible:

- Say “Pencils in the tray” instead of “Pencils down.”
- Say “Books open in front of you” instead of “Books out.”
- Say “Let me see those pencils moving” instead of “You should be writing.”

I hope my story here won’t make it seem as though making expectations visible is primarily a reactive strategy or a fix-it strategy for a struggling teacher. You may have noticed that Denarius Frazier, who appears throughout this book and who is surely one of the most exceptional teachers I have met, begins his class in the video *Denarius Frazier: Check in with Your Neighbor* with almost the exact direction David asked his struggling teacher to use: “Pencils down and track me in three … two … one.”

## TECHNIQUE 55: LEAST INVASIVE INTERVENTION

The goal of behavioral interventions is to get 100 percent of students on task, attentive, and positively engaged in the best possible lesson. Ironically, constant, time-consuming interventions intended to ensure that everyone is with you can sometimes make it all but impossible to teach. When instruction comes to a halt, whether it is because of a

---

<!-- Page 758 -->

disruption or because of the response to the disruption by the teacher, the result is that no one is on task because when the teacher is not teaching there usually is no task. And during the hiatus that can result from an interruption many students will find something else to pay attention to—their minds will wander; they will turn to look out the window, they will turn to a friend and raise an eyebrow. When instruction finally restarts, they are more distracted and less attentive, so the trick is to fix any problems or disruptions using the least invasive intervention and ensure that everyone can keep working.

Let's say I am teaching but Roberta has flopped her head down on her desk and, eyes closed, is either asleep or feigning sleep. I am keenly aware of the importance of fixing the situation. Not only will Roberta miss out on the lesson if I allow her to sleep—thus compounding whatever has caused her to be tired with a gap in her learning—but her action is a statement to other students that they, too, might put their heads down and sleep if they're tired or are just not “feeling it” that day. I should make sure after class that Roberta is all right if I have doubts—it's possible there are issues that require support, but let's also not rush to assume that; there's also a chance that Roberta is simply tired, as teenagers often are, and that this is a moment for loving accountability. If I allow Roberta to take a nap it won't be the last time this happens: I will soon have a classroom where, when it suits them, some number of my students will flop their heads down—some in silent judgment of school or society or adults or my teaching and some just because they can. Or because it's become the norm.

Let's say that, knowing all this, I stop my lesson on the Great Depression and speak to Roberta: “Roberta, what we're studying today is really important for you to know about. We're going to be writing essays about it, but you'll

---

<!-- Page 759 -->

also talk about this era constantly in college; please pick your head up and stay with us.” Even in the best-case scenario—Roberta raising her head and getting back to work right away—my interaction took several seconds, and, during that time, there was no further discussion of the Great Depression. It’s not just that learning stopped; engagement stopped, and sharp minds are now looking for a substitute.

It could even be that now I’ll have other fires to fight. “Jane, there are no cell phones allowed in this class,” I say to my student who took one out during the hiatus. “Carlos, I need you paying attention.” Each time I stop to correct one student, I risk losing another. I may never catch up.

It’s going to be a struggle from here to get the momentum back. Attention residue, which I discuss in Chapter One, means that part of what students thought about while the task was interrupted will remain on their minds when the interruption is over. And if the stops are frequent, we’ll never reach the kind of uninterrupted flow state that characterizes instruction at its best.

And of course there are all the questions about how Roberta will feel to have everyone looking at her. Yes, she needs to be awake and engaged in class. But having everyone staring at her hardly helps her concentrate. And it may make her resent me or even refuse to sit up.

So how would an expert teacher handle this? Would they intervene with Roberta? Almost assuredly. She may not feel that way at the moment but ten years from now she will wish she had not slept through classes. And if asked, her parents would be unlikely to say, “Please let my child sleep through classes.”

The goal might be the same, then, but the *how* would be very different. The teacher would seek to make the

---

<!-- Page 760 -->

correction as invisible as possible and, perhaps more important, they would make the correction *while still teaching*. They would put a premium on privacy. They might walk by while still teaching and put a gentle hand on Roberta's elbow but direct their gaze out toward the class (rather than down at Roberta) while they did this, to give Roberta as much privacy as possible to recover her attention. If Roberta was still slow to react, they might whisper to her in a tiny pause, “Make sure you’re sitting up please, Roberta.” If that didn't work, they might find a plausible moment to ask the class to engage in some other task such as a *Turn and Talk*—“Please take 30 seconds to review the definition of the Civilian Conservation Corps with your partner. Go!”—and then make a brief, low-key intervention: “Roberta, I can tell you're tired, but class is too important for me to allow you to sleep. Open to a clean sheet of paper. Your heading should say ‘Great Depression.’ I’ll be back to check on you in thirty seconds.”

They would be calm and steady. But most of all, they would be as fast as possible in order to keep the thread of instruction alive for the other twenty-nine students in the classroom. And therein lies the secret: if you can manage to correct noninvasively, you are likely to be able to set and reinforce expectations successfully and consistently.

**Six Interventions**

In watching great classroom managers, my team and I have made a list of six useful interventions, ranked in order of invasiveness from least to most. The goal, generally speaking, is to be as near to the top of this list as possible as often as possible.

**Intervention 1: Nonverbal Intervention**

---

<!-- Page 761 -->

First on the list is a *nonverbal intervention*. I observed this during a recent lesson taught by Ashley Hinton. As Ashley taught her students to write descriptive paragraphs, she constantly made micro corrections with either a hand gesture or intentional modeling of the action she expected students to take. As she did this, she never broke the thread of her engaging teaching; distracted students were corrected in privacy and at no cost to the lesson.

You can watch Ashley do this in the video *Ashley Hinton: Nonverbal Montage*. Notice how Ashley addresses minor issues with subtle and well-timed nonverbal interventions while they're still small and can be fixed with a tiny adjustment—small problem equals small solution and, in this case, no disruption. This also makes it easy for Ashley to stay positive in her tone as she makes her corrections. In addition, Ashley Circulates ([technique 25](#)) constantly while she makes her corrections. Always on the move, she's able to approach a student to give a bit more clarity to her corrections without other students noticing. Her gestures are consistent—she focuses on just two or three expectations that she wants to see—and, of course, she keeps teaching.

It's important to remember that a nonverbal intervention is not inherently noninvasive, even if it looks that way when Ashley does it. To be noninvasive, you have to keep teaching and keep moving, embedding corrections in the larger flow of class. I was recently watching a teacher struggling to use nonverbals to address behavior in her classroom. The reason? She failed to continue teaching while making nonverbal corrections. She broke off her discussion and walked two rows to her left as the class watched her intently. She stopped and made a dramatic gesture to a student to sit up and stared at him waiting for him to follow her directions. At this point, with no instruction going on, everyone was staring at her and the

---

<!-- Page 762 -->

student in question. Despite the nonverbal nature of the interaction, her intervention failed the “noninvasive” test.

Last, nonverbals work best when they are consistent and limited in scope. To begin using nonverbals, I might choose the one or two most common low-level distractions in my classrooms and develop a consistent nonverbal for each. If there are only a few signals, you can use them, and your students can process them without distracting any of you from the content of the lesson. For her part, Ashley Hinton chose to use gestures to remind her students to track the speaker with their eyes (see technique 48, *Habits of Attention*) to put their hands down when a classmate was talking, and to sit attentively.

## Intervention 2: Positive Group Correction

Slightly more invasive but still with a very small footprint is *positive group correction*—a quick, verbal reminder offered to the entire group, advising them to take a specific action. Like a nonverbal intervention, a positive group correction is ideal for catching off-task behavior early. The word “positive” comes from the concept that this intervention always describes the solution (a positive) rather than the problem (a negative). “Group” refers to the fact that it's directed to the entire class as opposed to specific students. Because the goal is to be noninvasive, this form of correction tends to be very short and preserves economy of language. “Check that you're sitting up straight” (or “Check your SLANT,” if you use the acronym) is a classic. About a second, and you're back to teaching. If you need to boost the level of accountability with specific students, you might do that nonverbally at the same time; that is, you might say, “I need to see everyone writing,” while you briefly focus on an individual student who needs a bit more support with some eye contact and perhaps a slight nod of

---

<!-- Page 763 -->

your head. The idea is that, in speaking to the group, it also corrects those students whom you might not see.

Of course, while you can establish nonverbal accountability for individuals, you keep noncompliers off the public stage. Saying a student's name usually causes people to look at him, and this can cause resentment or sometimes reward (i.e. being looked at is what the student wants). If you make the effort to show that you are trying to solve something without “calling a student out” and while preserving their privacy, the result is usually positive.

## Intervention 3: Anonymous Individual Correction

The next intervention, an *anonymous individual correction*, is similar to a *positive group correction* in that it describes the solution; however, it makes it explicit that there are people (as yet anonymous) who have not yet met expectations. You might combine it with a positive group correction to make it sound like this: “Eyes up here, please [*positive group correction*]. I need two more sets of eyes [*anonymous individual correction*].”

As with the positive group correction, you can supplement an anonymous individual correction with nonverbals, especially eye contact and a quick nod, to establish directly and privately whom you are expecting to fix the situation fast. The combination of verbal group accountability and nonverbal individual accountability can be especially effective.

Laura Baxter does a nice job of this in *Laura Baxter: Orange Row*. Twice she pauses briefly to remind students that their focus needs improving or they need to face forward, but she's always calm and keeps the individuals she's referring to anonymous, although in one case you can see there's some subtle eye contact—subtle enough that you don't see classmates turning around to see who is

---

<!-- Page 764 -->

causing the problem. Her economy of language is also great.

## Intervention 4: Private Individual Correction (PIC)

The next level of intervention is a *private individual correction*. When you have to name names, you can still make use of privacy. And when you need to take more time with a student, you can make it less invasive by asking the class to work independently, or by making your intervention at a time when it’s easy to be offstage.

That was one of the strategies I suggested a master teacher might try, especially if Roberta had not responded to earlier less invasive efforts to get her on task—“Please take thirty seconds to review the definition of the Civilian Conservation Corps with your partner. Go!”11—And then make a brief intervention that was as private as possible. “Roberta, I can tell you’re tired, but class is too important for me to allow you to sleep. Open up your notebook to a clean sheet of paper. Your heading should say ‘Great Depression.’ I’ll be back to check on you in thirty seconds.”

Here, with your voice dropped to show you are not trying to make something public out of it, the intervention is likely to be more effective, especially if you are careful to describe the solution, not the problem (see *technique 52*, *What to Do*) and to emphasize purpose (“This is important for you to learn”) over power (which is why something like “When I ask someone to sit up, I expect to see them do it” is generally ineffective).

You can see Josh Goodrich, then of Oasis South Bank in London, make a private individual correction in the video *Josh Goodrich: Let’s Get to It*. Most of his students are working industriously but one student has just not been able to get himself going. Josh spots him and walks over, dropping his voice to a whisper. “I need to see you writing

---

<!-- Page 765 -->

within ten seconds. Let's get to it, mate.” His tone is calm and steady. His directions are clear. He whispers to preserve privacy and he's quick. You could be sitting two seats away and miss the whole thing.

**Balance with Private Individual Precise Praise (PIPP)**  
We call a *private individual correction* a PIC for short, and its partner is the PIPP, or *private individual precise praise*. When you use PIPP, you walk over to a student, just as you would when you make a PIC, but whisper positive feedback instead of criticism. If students come to expect that a private intervention could be either positive or corrective, they will be more open to you as you approach them. You also earn trust for your criticism by balancing it with praise. Most of all, you build a defense against the sort of eavesdropping that students do when they are curious about or take delight in the misfortune of others. In other words, if the content is unpredictable—sometimes positive, sometimes corrective or constructive—the urgent need to listen for the juicy bits of discipline disappears. Frankly, the idea that you might approach Roberta and say, “I thought that answer was outstanding. Keep up the good work” is not terribly intriguing to eavesdroppers. Such positive comments can help to protect the privacy of the student when you need to tell Roberta to sit up.

**Intervention 5: Lightning-Quick Public Correction**  
It would be great if you could make every correction quick and private, but we all know that in a complex place like a classroom it just doesn't work like that. You will be forced, at times, to make corrections or give reminders to individual students during public moments. In those cases, your goals should be to limit the amount of time a student is “onstage” for something negative, to focus on telling the student what to do right rather than what he or she did wrong,

---

<!-- Page 766 -->

and then to call everyone's attention to something else, ideally something more positive, and doubly so if it helps build reinforce positive norms. This is called a *lightning-quick public correction*, and it might sound something like, “Quentin, I need your pencil moving … just like those sharp-looking scholars in my back row!” or “Quentin, I need your pencil moving” and then “Josefina, I can't wait to hear what you're writing about.”

Perhaps the most effective single action for “hiding” a public correction or reminder is whispering it. Even if you're in public. Even if everyone can still hear you. You can see this done effectively in the video *Jason Armstrong: Don't Miss It*. Jason, in fact, makes two corrections of students who are off task, and both are essentially public and audible. He's standing in front of the class when he makes them, but they *feel* like private individual corrections because he whispers them. By dropping his voice he is reminding the students he is correcting that he is doing everything he can to keep it as private as he can, that he's sensitive to and respectful of their feelings and does not want to embarrass them. A whisper, even if everyone else can hear it, says, “I am trying to do this without calling too much attention to you.” It creates trust and the illusion of privacy. For this reason a *whisper correction* is one of the most powerful tools a teacher can use.

## Intervention 6: Consequence

The last form of intervention is a consequence. Giving consequences is technical and challenging—enough so that it is the subject of its own technique later in this chapter; however, it's worth noting that many of the elements of noninvasiveness I have discussed (whispering, making the conversation private, etc.) can also be applied to a consequence.

---

<!-- Page 767 -->

# Common Misperceptions

One common misperception about the levels of intervention is that they represent a process or a formula—that you should always progress methodically through each level, trying all six types of correction in sequence before giving a consequence. Although the goal is to be as close to the top of the list as possible, great classroom managers maintain fidelity to what works. Sometimes they go straight to a consequence, sometimes back and forth among the levels; and occasionally they use several interventions with an off-task student. In fact, using levels 1 to 5 implies that students are making (or appear likely to be making) a good-faith effort to comply with expectations when reminded. Behavior that is deliberate and is disruptive most often is behavior that should earn a consequence.

Another common misperception is that ignoring misbehavior—or addressing it by praising students who are behaving—is the least invasive form of intervention. In fact, ignoring misbehavior is the *most* invasive form of intervention, because the behavior becomes more likely to persist and expand. The goal is to address behavior quickly, while its manifestation is still minimal and the required response still small.

# TECHNIQUE 56: FIRM, CALM FINESSE

Great classroom managers are steady at the helm. They may show passion when discussing history or science, but when they ask a student to get to work or not to call out answers, they are calm and composed. They act as if they couldn’t imagine a universe in which students wouldn’t follow through, and this, in turn, causes students to follow through. These teachers do their work with finesse, and generally take steps to engage students without conflict.

Here are six general rules for teaching with *Firm, Calm Finesse*.

**Rule 1: Catch It Early**

Sometimes we want to believe that a problem, left alone, will cure itself. Most often, it persists or gets worse because we've sent the message that we'll tolerate it for a while. Eventually, we have to step in with a bigger fix, in part because the behavior has gotten more bold or disruptive, and in part because we are starting to get frustrated. Here's a phrase my team uses that teachers have often found helpful for self-reflection: If you're mad, you've waited too long. It's usually better to fix something with a tiny adjustment very early than to make a bigger intervention later. You're far more likely to correct positively and with a smile when your corrections feel like tiny adjustments to you as well as to your students.

**Rule 2: Value Purpose over Power**

The reason you correct behaviors in the classroom is that doing so leads to a vibrant, positive learning environment, student achievement, and even habits of self-discipline. Strive to make your language constantly stress that the goal is helping students learn and succeed, not reinforcing your own power. Statements like “When I ask you to sit up, I want to see you sitting up” are best avoided. “Please get this down so you're prepared for the test” or “You'll need to be on time to class so we have a full 60 minutes together” are much better. Keep corrections tight and crisp, but try to remind students (and yourself) that your high expectations are, in the end, about the students, not you.

**Rule 3: Remember That “Thank You” Is the Strongest Phrase**

---

<!-- Page 769 -->

Saying “Thank you” after a student follows a direction is one of the most subtly powerful things you can do, for two reasons. First, it is a sign that a strong community characterized by civility and mutual appreciation is in existence when “please” and “thank you” are frequently used. So it’s good to model “please” and “thank you” in your classroom, especially at moments when students might question whether they still apply; for example, are they still full members of the community when they receive a redirection? Of course, but when you say, “Hands folded in front of you, please, Maya,” it subtly reminds her of that. Then, when Maya folds her hands, you can say, in a low and slightly muted tone: “Thank you.”

Saying “thank you” also reinforces expectations and normalizes follow-through. You would only say “thank you” because Maya had followed your direction. It shows your appreciation to her and it subtly reminds everyone else in the class that the norm is to do what the teacher has asked you.

**Rule 4: Use Universal Language**

Look for chances to remind students that expectations are universal and not personal. Although “I need you with me” is fine, “We need you with us” is better. It suggests that learning is a team sport, and subtly says that the rest of the class is also meeting the expectations you are asking an individual to adhere to. “Let’s make sure we’re all tracking the speaker,” as an alternate to “Please make sure you’re tracking the speaker,” reminds everyone that the expectation is universal.

**Rule 5: Bright Face**

Your bright face is your teaching smile—or at least your age-appropriate, default expression of “I like this work, I

---

<!-- Page 770 -->

like the people here, and I'm pretty confident that I'm in charge.” You can see Patrick Pastore's bright face when he looks up to scan his class most days. He starts with a smile, not a scowl. His bright, pleasant face is confident. His plan, it says, is to trust but verify. This is very different from a teacher whose scowl says *I'm not happy here, I'm worried about students following my directions*, or even *I'm waiting for them not to do what I ask, because I'm sure it's going to happen*. That can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.

To underscore, your bright face does not have to be a huge, beaming smile especially if it's not sincere. It's just a pleasant expression that exudes a degree of positivity and confidence that matches your style and the age group of your students. With kindergartners, it might really be an irrepressible smile. With high schoolers, it might be a bit more subdued.

It's important to use such a face whenever possible but it's especially good to show it immediately after or even during a redirection or correction—first, to remind students generally that all is well, and second, to remind particularly the student who you may have had to redirect that they are still in your good stead.

## Rule 6: Use Your Confirmation Glance

Trust, and demonstrating trust, are among the most important things you can communicate in building a relationship with others. Showing trust is self-fulfilling—if you signal that you trust, students will follow through when you make a request.

There are times when it's critical to ask and then look or walk away and show that you trust students to follow through. A confirmation glance is the ideal tool to use to verify follow-through. To use it, you walk away and then glance strategically back. Sometimes a student needs just a

---

<!-- Page 771 -->

bit of space to pull it together and decide he or she wants to do the right thing, and a confirmation glance can provide it. It's best to begin by being brief with the delay before a confirmation glance, and then extend it a bit longer over your time with the class. Sometimes teachers use it explicitly with students, as in, “I'm going to walk away, and when I look back, I am going to see you with your pencil in your hand, writing your response.” Of course, you will need to follow up decisively if your confirmation glance reveals lack of follow-through, but using it can intimate a potent, calm, self-assuredness to your class.

## TECHNIQUE 57: ART OF THE CONSEQUENCE

Unfortunately, despite your best efforts to redirect nonproductive behavior with subtlety and grace, to prevent small things from becoming bigger things and to encourage students to choose to do the most positive things, you will have to give consequences in your classroom. This is all but inevitable and it is not a statement about what you believe or don't believe about students. You should love your students and want the best for them. You will still occasionally be in a situation that calls for consequences. In many cases you will give consequences *because* you care about your students. The key is to give consequences judiciously, justly, and humanely with the purpose of changing nonproductive behaviors into positive behaviors rather than punishing.

And in the end if your consequences are appropriate—that is, in most cases they let students learn lessons at small cost—given with humanity and supported by teaching, they are a useful thing. “Treating students as having responsibility over their actions is vital if we are to teach them how to accept responsibility for themselves, to

---

<!-- Page 772 -->

manage their own lives, to grow in maturity,” writes Tom Bennett. “Students must learn to self-regulate, to restrain their own immediate desires and whims, to persevere even when they don't want to before they can learn ... independent behavior.”

Bennett's observations lead us to recognize something we often lose sight of: a just, fair, and manageable consequence is an act of caring to a student who must learn to respect and set limits and self-regulate. Of course we don't wish to make them unhappy now; but a small unhappiness now is preferable to larger disappointments later—and of course to allowing the rights and dignity of others to be trampled. To a student who is too impulsive, life may bring an array of potential challenges we would never wish them to have to struggle with. If consequences in school can help them to replace their impulsiveness with more disciplined responses, we have done students a favor. Try to express to students if and when you must give consequences that they are an act of caring.

But all this talk of consequences as an act of caring only goes so far when they backfire. And consequences are notoriously tricky. As I'm sure nearly every teacher can attest, they do not always have the intended effect. Who hasn't given a consequence that, instead of reducing a negative behavior, actually made it worse? As my team and I set out to learn from great teachers, we observed classrooms where consequences had the intended effect, not just some of the time but nearly all of the time, and these observations inform what I have dubbed Art of the Consequence.

## Principles of the Effective Consequence

Consequences, used properly, are not merely punishments with a sanitized name. Their purpose is to efficiently

---

<!-- Page 773 -->

reinforce sound decision making—to respond to situations in which mistakes are made so that students learn from them. Their goal should be to develop and teach, and this goal can and should be evident in how you employ consequences. The following sections describe a few principles of effective consequences.

## Incremental

It isn't the size of a consequence that changes student behavior but the consistency of it. Designing consequences so that they can be allocated in smaller increments lets students learn from mistakes at manageable cost. “Small mistake, small consequence” works really well for students, and it's better for you as well. If your consequences are heartbreaking for the students you love, you will hesitate and probably not use them. Plan out a system of consequences that starts small and scales up gradually in severity. The first response should be a disincentive, not a life-altering event.

We've all seen an elementary school student become bereft over a color change. This is one reason why in many classrooms I have seen a color change chart that shows everyone on green while the teacher is near tears with frustration. The system isn't incremental, so it doesn't get used. One simple change is to subdivide a color change (green to yellow or yellow to red) into a series of three checks. If a student is calling out and you've asked him to stop but the action persists, he is telling you he needs a clearer reminder, but a check is far more useful than a color change. “That’s a check for you, Donald,” you might whisper, “Please work harder not to call out when it's someone else's turn.”

Another benefit of small, scaled consequences is that they enable you to respond consistently, but still offer students a

---

<!-- Page 774 -->

clear and feasible path to success. A student who loses all of his or her privileges has no incentive to stay in the game.

## Quick

An immediate consequence is more closely associated with the action that caused it than a delayed consequence. If the goal is to shape behavior rather than to punish it, try to give a consequence right away. A smaller consequence in the moment (for example, “Scholars, go back to the door and come into this classroom quietly please”) will often be more effective than a larger consequence that occurs later (“Gentlemen, I will see you here after school”). Quick consequences also reduce the amount of time a student’s behavior remains onstage. This latter benefit removes students’ incentive to engage in attention-seeking behavior and minimizes the odds of escalating behavior.

## Consistent

Responses should be predictable in students’ minds: “If I do X, Y will happen.” If they aren’t sure what will happen, then they have an incentive to “test” and see. Thus consistency and incrementalism go together. We are trying to teach, not punish, so the message should not be *It’s OK sometimes, but not other times.*

Consistently using the same language reduces the transaction costs involved with giving consequences, and also makes them more legible to students (for example, “Michael, please don’t call out, two scholar dollars” or “Michael, calling out, two scholar dollars”^12). Students won’t have to worry about trying to decipher your consequences and you won’t have to spend time and explaining. And of course you’ll want to explain what calling out is and why it’s a problem in advance. What is expected of students should be defined for them.

---

<!-- Page 775 -->

If you and your students shift activities or move to different areas of the room, your management system should follow. Whether you're teaching from desks or the carpet, stick with the system and approach that students know and understand. Otherwise, students will quickly learn when and where they can test the limits.

## As Private as Possible

In technique 55, *Least Invasive Intervention*, I discuss the benefits of privacy. When you seek to employ it, you remind a student that you are not trying to embarrass them, and you avoid situations where responses are public and a relationship-corrosive back and forth may ensue. These things are doubly important when giving consequences. We want students to know we give consequences when we must, and we should be prepared for them not to be happy about it. In both cases privacy helps. Using a whisper correction, a nonverbal gesture, or a private individual correction can help.

## Depersonalized

Avoid personalizing consequences by keeping them as private as possible (with a whisper, during a one-on-one interaction, for example) and by judging actions instead of people (for example, “That was inconsiderate of your classmates, Daniel,” versus “You are very inconsiderate, Daniel.”). Maintaining privacy shows consideration to the student, which can go a long way toward preserving your relationship with him or her. It also keeps behavior offstage, which reduces the likelihood of attention-seeking behavior or a public standoff that benefits no one.

Finally, strive to remember that strong teacher emotions distract students from reflecting on the behavior(s) that resulted in a consequence. Maintain a neutral facial expression and steady tone of voice when you deliver the

---

<!-- Page 776 -->

consequence, and then continue teaching with warmth and enthusiasm.

## Notes on Delivery

In addition to exuding *Emotional Constancy*, protecting privacy, and making sure consequences are focused on purpose, not power, teachers who give consequences that reliably change behavior for the better follow the principles described in the next sections.

## Use a Bounce-Back Statement

It's probably safe to say that every teacher has encountered a student who shuts down once he or she receives a consequence. In that instant, some students feel as though the whole world is against them, including you, so they convince themselves that they should cut their losses and stop trying. Your goal is to suggest otherwise and nudge them forward into a productive direction. One way is by delivering a “bounce-back” statement that shows students that success is still within their grasp. For example, you might say something like “Michael, please don't call out. That's two scholar dollars. I know you can do this” or “That's two scholar dollars. I can't wait to see your hand up so I can call on you.” When you use bounce-back statements, you socialize students to persist in the face of emotional duress, which is a life skill that will benefit them long after they leave your classroom.

## Maintain the Pace

Responding to behavior by lecturing or giving a speech disengages the rest of the class and increases the likelihood of other fires sprouting up. Here are a couple of tips for maintaining the pace when emotions run high and you have to give a consequence:

---

<!-- Page 777 -->

Describe what students *should be doing* as opposed to what they *are not doing* (“Michael, I need your eyes” is better than “Michael, for the last time, stop getting distracted!”).

Use the least amount of verbiage you can (“That's two bucks. I need you tracking,” rather than “You just earned a two-scholar-dollar deduction because you chose to draw cartoons when you were supposed to be listening to my lecture. You should know better …,” and so forth). Doing so maximizes instructional time and minimizes the amount of time students are left onstage.

## Get Back on Track

When it comes to consequences, the goal is to get in, get out, and *move on* with the business of teaching. Teachers who are able to get *all* students back on track after a consequence remember to show that it's over.

What you focus on after you give a consequence speaks volumes to students about what you value. If you want students to carry on with learning, resume instruction with warmth and energy. Find an opportunity to talk to students in a calm, relaxed manner to show that the interaction is over. You can even go a step further by getting the student who received a consequence positively back into the flow of class by asking a question or acknowledging his or her work. Doing so models forgiveness and shows students that you still value them and want them to be successful.

## The Million-Dollar Question: Consequence or Correction?

One of the trickiest aspects of managing a classroom is deciding when to give a consequence rather than a correction. The question is tough, in part because teachers must decide on a case-by-case basis. That being said, here are some helpful rules of thumb:

---

<!-- Page 778 -->

**Persistence and repetition.** When students *persistently* engage in off-task behavior that they know they shouldn't, this should push you more toward a consequence. This is especially true when students continue in spite of your correction(s). If, instead, the behavior appears to be a one time error caused by distraction or misunderstanding, then err on the side of correction.

**Degree of disruption.** If a student's behavior doesn't disrupt others' learning, then it's more likely that a correction is warranted. In contrast, if the student's behavior distracts or disrupts others, a consequence is more likely to be warranted. You have a responsibility to maintain the group environment.

**Motivation.** If a student is clearly testing your expectations, give a consequence. Tolerating willful defiance corrodes your authority in the eyes of the student as well as the rest of the class. Just be sure that's the case before you rush to judge.

---

<!-- Page 779 -->

# What Comes After

Many of the actions we take when we give a consequence are shaped by the necessary fact that we are teaching or are in charge of a group of people while we give them in most cases. That said there is an immense opportunity and often a responsibility for a follow-up conversation designed to explain and even better to teach. Here are some notes.

## Explained, With Love

The first thing is to remind students that you have to give them consequences because you care about them. You want them to understand something that they are struggling to learn or hear something that they are struggling to hear because you care about them and want the best for them. Distinguish between the behavior and the person. “I believe in you and think you're a great kid; but of course I can't allow you to push someone else in the classroom, just like it wouldn't be OK with me if someone else pushed you.” Do this with calmness and *Emotional Constancy*. If you're upset don't attempt an explanation until you're confident you can sustain *Emotional Constancy*.

## Teaching a Replacement Behavior

It's not enough in the long run to tell someone *not* to do something. Our job as educators is to teach people *what to do*, instead. What a student can do, instead, at the moment when they are inclined to do something counterproductive, is known as a **replacement behavior**. *Instead of reacting quickly in anger at a*

---

<!-- Page 780 -->

*classmate, here are three questions to ask myself. Instead of calling out I can jot down what I wanted to say or send magic to a classmate, so they suspect I know the answer, too.*

*It won't be enough for a student to know a replacement behavior, of course. If they're likely to be able to use it, they'll need to practice it a bit. As in: I'm going to ask you some questions that you know the answer to, and you're going to practice writing down a word or two, to remind you of what you want to say rather than calling out, OK? and that can be a great way to make “talking it over” a productive and active task.*

Background knowledge is profoundly important to learning. That starts with vocabulary. To name something is to conjure it into being. *When you keep from doing something you have an urge to do, it's called self-regulation.* That makes it easier to talk about.

But background knowledge can go further. You could give an impulsive student a short article about the role of the amygdala in mindfulness—summarizing the idea that if you can delay your response by even a second you can better regulate it. If students understand the science behind what is happening to them, they can often be more successful in making changes.

A good, brief article on the role of the amygdala can be hard to find the moment you need it, obviously, so it might be worth keeping a few articles about predictable challenges at the ready. That's the idea behind the Dean of Students' Curriculum<sup>13</sup> my team developed under Hilary Lewis's leadership. It's a set of dozens of reflective knowledge-based lessons to help students reflect on common nonproductive behaviors.

# Self-Checking

Giving consequences to students is hard. It rarely makes them happy. It rarely make teachers happy. There's the risk that despite your best efforts to always be fair and accurate and judicious you will be wrong in giving a consequence, in the single case or perhaps you will have misunderstood a particular student even more broadly. There will be a student in whom you somehow see the wrong more than she deserves or one whom you never quite notice when she gives her best. And yet it's necessary to set limits for students. Tom Bennett's guidance that “Treating students as having responsibility over their actions is vital if we are to teach them to accept responsibility for themselves, to manage their own lives and grow in maturity” is helpful to keep in mind. So are these four sets of questions to ask yourself, to help you make sure you're on the right path.

- **About Design:** Is your consequence system scaled and gradual? Are there small consequences students can use to learn lessons at low cost? Are the consequences incremental and scaled? Do they always specify the behavior that caused them so students know and can learn from what they did wrong? Is the system aligned across the school? Are there positive consequences as well, so students' positive behavior is also reinforced? Is positive reinforcement intermittent, occasional, and framed in appreciation of extra effort (rather than an expectation)?

- **About the Decision:** Am I more inclined to give consequences for persistent and repetitive behaviors and less inclined to give corrections for single low-level incidents? Am I more inclined to give consequences for behaviors that disrupt the learning opportunities for other students or endanger their safety? Am I more inclined to give corrections for behavior that only

---

<!-- Page 782 -->

affects the student involved? Do I take motivation into account when I can? Do we as a school or a grade-team make these decisions similarly and consistently?

- **About Delivery:** Am I as private as I can be? Do I attempt to drop my voice or whisper if in public? Am I emotionally constant in asking the student to focus on his or her own actions? Do I tag the behavior, so my students know what I think they've done wrong? Am I quick and do I get back to teaching promptly, ideally including the student in question in the lesson?

- **Discipline:** Have I explained and taught my expectations? Have I explained and maybe even practiced with my students what to do when a consequence is given, generally and specifically, and what to do when and if a consequence is given and the student(s) do not agree? Is there a process for students who get consequences they don't agree with to follow?

# TECHNIQUE 58: STRONG VOICE

The communication we are consciously aware of amounts to only a portion—sometimes a small one—of the communication we actually do.14 We may *think* our listeners are attending to the content of our words but that's only partly true. When people listen, they react to an array of signals (tone, expression, and body language) that begin influencing them right away. “Affective reactions are so tightly integrated with perception that we find ourselves liking or disliking something the instant we notice it, sometimes even before we know what it is,” writes the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt.15 In his book *The Righteous Mind* he describes the process of belief and opinion formation in cognitive terms and finds that humans typically have instant reactions based on factors they

---

<!-- Page 783 -->

perceive subconsciously, and then later create explanations and justifications for those responses. Those justifications and responses are often “based on socially strategic purposes.” We react in a fraction of a second and afterwards try to convince ourselves that our responses were justified and look to use our responses to build the social bonds that are so important to us.

*Ha! That was funny. I laughed too!*

*Ha! What a fool he is. You and I, we are smarter than that.*

The chain of reactions that begins with how people read our tone, expression, and body language is long and complex. *Strong Voice* helps you attend to signals communicated by such factors in your communication as a teacher and use them to increase the likelihood that students will react productively and positively to the things you ask of them. This is especially important because attending to such signals can be especially valuable in avoiding or resolving situations where emotions run hot and where the follow-through required from students is far better achieved without raised voices or recrimination.

Aligning your tone, expression, and body language signals to the rest of your communication helps you to build stronger relationships, ensure productivity and, especially, avoid the sorts of showdowns that can spiral into negativity. A shouting match is a disaster for teacher and student, in the moment it happens and over the long run of a relationship that often struggles to recover. Needless to say there is a lot more to building relationships than the topics discussed here. They are merely one contributing aspect—a critical one for a person charged with responsibility for ensuring that thirty students get from point A to point B in a timely manner so learning can happen and regardless of whatever is on their personal agendas at the moment.

---

<!-- Page 784 -->

While *Strong Voice* is a critical technique for teachers to master, it is also one that is easily misunderstood, so I begin with some important notes on the purpose and even the name of the technique, which, to be honest, I almost changed for this version of the book, in part because “strong voice” has always been a bit of a misnomer. It is a technique as much about body language as about voice, for example. More importantly, the strength implied is in most cases about steadiness and self-control, about maintaining poise and composure, especially under duress.

Social science research tells us that emotions broadcast to others are contagious. When we're conversing, we're not merely exchanging ideas, we're often shaping the listener's mindset and emotions. Researchers have found that emotions can spread between individuals even when their contact with each other is *entirely nonverbal*. In one study, three strangers were observed facing one another in silence. Researchers found that an emotionally expressive person transmitted his or her mood to the other two without uttering a word.^16 What we do with our voice, words, and body language can cause others to shift into modes of communication more like our own and this phenomenon has a name, “mirroring,” which refers to the way in which we unconsciously synchronize our emotional state to match that of another person's during an interaction. One implication for teachers is that if we can keep our composure, or even noticeably recompose ourselves as things get tense, others are likely to follow. And of course if we lose our composure others are more likely to as well.

Young people's emotions are real and often intense; our job as teachers is not to tell them not to feel them. However, part of our job *is* to help them manage emotions, keep control, and match their response to the setting. I am sure there are people who will see this as “controlling,” but I

---

<!-- Page 785 -->

think most teachers are clear on the benefits to young people when we help them learn to self-regulate as they enter society.

To return briefly to the word “strong,” however, at trainings my team and I run, our coaching often involves helping teachers not to come on so “strong” with their *Strong Voice* —to be calmer and quieter, to appear self-assured, not loud. One potential reason people might try to be more forceful in tone and body language than necessary is the name itself: something called *Strong Voice* must be about being overpowering, right?

Wrong. A composed teacher makes it more likely that students will maintain their composure, will focus on the message, and not be distracted by how it was delivered. Being more aware of your body language and tone of voice and keeping them purposeful, poised, and confident helps you and your students.

So while I toyed with the idea of renaming *Strong Voice*, I have kept it for continuity's sake—and chosen instead to add framing to help make sure the purpose is clear.

## The Six Principles of *Strong Voice*

Over the years, my team and I have had the privilege of watching hundreds of teachers who lead vibrant, rigorous, and joyful classrooms that are also productive and orderly. These two things are related. When students follow directions, teachers can make engaging and rigorous activities happen with a minimum of fuss. And teachers who provide quality lessons are more likely to get students to do as they ask. Neither of these causes the other, but attending to both helps.

The more we studied such teachers, the more we noticed patterns in what they did to ensure follow-through when

---

<!-- Page 786 -->

they asked students to do things.

We have distilled these observations into six replicable principles that teachers can name a practice.

## Principle 1: Shift Your Register

Watch the body language of Arielle Hoo and Denarius Frazier in the short video Hoo and Frazier: Register Shift. In the moment when each asks for students' attention, their body language shifts slightly. Arielle steps back from the projector, holds herself upright and symmetrical, and scans the room. She does this for perhaps a second. Beforehand, she's more fluid in her motions and posture and by the time she has said, “Great, let's take a look at Tyler's work,” she has shifted back to this more informal body language once again, but in that short moment of formality she signals to her class the importance of what they are about to do and they respond. She's asked for their eye contact with her words but, also, with the signals of body language and tone.

So, too, does Denarius. Preparing students to analyze an example of student work, he steps forward slightly, so students can see him better. He stands upright, chin slightly raised, and symmetrical. His cadence slows slightly. Again there's an air of formality. And then, like Arielle, the formality dissolves into a more casual tone, “On a few of our papers ...” he says, his voice now sounding more relaxed. But that short shift has signalled to students that what we are doing is important, worthy of increased attention, and they have intuitively responded.

Neither teacher is tense, mind you, just slightly formal and this moment of heightened formality is like a punctuation mark: short but legible and shaping the meaning of what gets said before and after.

---

<!-- Page 787 -->

This is what I call a **register shift** and to understand it further it will be helpful to first define the term *register*, which I use to refer to the overall tone communicated by a teacher's affect—her voice, her body language, her facial expressions, and so on. In our study of classrooms, we typically observe teachers shifting between three registers: casual, formal, and urgent.

The table titled “Three Registers” further differentiates typical features.

### Three Registers

| Register | Voice/Words | Body Language |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Casual** | • Words may run together (e.g. with a pitter-patter rhythm)<br>• Frequent vocal inflections and a wide range of pitch<br>• Use of colloquial language | • Asymmetrical distribution of weight on each foot (e.g. leaning more on one foot)<br>• Relaxed posture<br>• Inconsistent eye contact |

---

<!-- Page 788 -->

| Register | Voice/Words | Body Language |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Formal** | * Clearly articulated words and syllables<br>* Carefully chosen words that describe the solution or next step forward<br>* Intentionally slows or pauses speech for emphasis<br>* Drops intonation at the end of sentences to signal certainty and finality | * Symmetrical distribution of weight on feet, which are placed shoulder-width apart<br>* Upright posture<br>* Steady eye contact<br>* Hands relaxed at one's sides or clasped in front or behind back |
| **Urgent** | * Loud volume, intensity of tone and emotion<br>* Words run together<br>* Exaggerated emphasis on a specific word or words | * Widened eyes<br>* Leaning in versus standing straight up<br>* Rushed and abrupt gestures |

When teachers want students to hear and follow through on their requests, they often shift into a version of the

---

<!-- Page 789 -->

*formal register*, using their body language and tone to emphasize the importance of what they're saying. This might mean doing some of the things Arielle and Denarius were doing: standing symmetrically, and with an upright posture, slowing the cadence of speech, minimizing inflection, and articulating each word with intentional clarity. Or modulating movements slightly. When Arielle and Denarius move during a register shift, they do so with poise and purpose. They reduce the amount and scope of hand gestures. They are often deliberately still. These things send a clear message that what they're saying is important and deserves attention and follow-through.

This *formal register* contrasts with the *casual register*, which signals relaxed openness and but also optionality—to be casual is to say *Take it or leave it* or *We're just chatting here*. When teachers assume a casual register, we often observe them standing with a relaxed posture. If they're very casual, they might be leaning against a wall or piece of classroom furniture. They often allow their words to run together, the words coming fast like raindrops, each hard to differentiate from the previous with absolute clarity, and their range of inflection varies widely.

Teachers often use some version of a more casual register when delivering content. For example, to become animated in an art class when you talk about shading and cross-hatching is to express enthusiasm and energy for these methods, and students commonly respond to enthusiasm and energy. To state the obvious, a range of casual registers exists. Each person's register is different, qualitatively but also quantitatively: versions of casual speech can communicate everything from “Oh, man, I looove this passage,” to “Let us relax a bit and take pleasure in reading the novel aloud for a moment.” Some teachers rarely use the casual register at all and maintain, quite successfully, an air of seriousness and formality

throughout. Each teacher has his or her own style of teaching, and this is as it should be. Variety is beneficial; the core work of teaching can be done in a wide range of casual and formal registers. You be you.

But every teacher also needs to be able to shift, for example, into the formal from the casual or into a higher degree of formality from their everyday self in moments when, like Arielle and Denarius, they want to signal that paying attention and following through are now especially important. There are two parts to that observation: the work is done by *both* the tone *and* the shift. The discernable change in affect draws students' attention; the formal affect expresses importance once you have their attention.

You can see an especially clear and effective example of this in the video *Trona Cenac: Register Shifts*. As the video opens, Trona is chatting casually with students before the beginning of class on the first day of school at Troy Prep High School. Her body language is casual: loose and asymmetrical. You can tell from the student's use of language (“I did that packet and I was like …”) that she reads the casualness of the situation. Suddenly it's time to start class. Trona signals this in part through her voice and more upright body language. Her shoulders are back and her chin is raised. Students are quickly attentive, though, and everything is going well so she moves to the front of the group and greets students in the casual register. She's asymmetrical with a relaxed smile. Soon after there are important directions to hear. Trona emphasizes this by assuming a more formal bearing. Here's a series of still shots from the video that show the clear differences in Trona's body language from when she is casual to when she is formal.

The following graphic may help you to conceptualize the idea of shifting registers. Your range of normal teaching may be somewhere within a range of casual to formal, depending on your personal style. Likely your range varies slightly from day to day and moment to moment depending on factors such as the content you're teaching.

Teach

Important Directions  
Urgent  

I should note that I have discussed only two of the three available registers. The urgent register is, for the most part, counterproductive in classrooms, except in the case of absolute emergencies. Using this register increases tension and anxiety. It may be useful if someone is in danger of imminent physical harm, for example, but use it in other situations and you'll likely come off as nervous and panicky or you'll ratchet up the level of tension at exactly the moment when you want things to remain calm. It will just as likely become a self-fulfilling prophecy. If it becomes familiar, students may experience “urgency fatigue” and grow immune to it. Then you won't have it if you ever really need it.  

More relevant to most teachers, however, is that creeping hint of urgency that can sneak into our communication when things aren't going as we'd like. Students aren't following directions and seem to be, perhaps deliberately, not doing what is expected. We speak as if through gritted teeth. Our posture becomes stilted and tense and that tension creeps into our voices, too. We can begin slipping into it without realizing it. My team and I find it useful to practice listening for this, to take a phrase we might say in the classroom and practice saying it casually and formally so we can hear the difference and find the tone that feels right, and then practice saying it in an urgent register so

---

<!-- Page 793 -->

we become attuned to what we sound like when we start to slip. If we are aware, if we hear it when it happens, we can correct it more quickly.

As this implies there are several skills implicit in managing your register. The first is awareness: What register am I in right now? What is it communicating? Does my register align to my words? Are my words saying “I need your attention” but my body language that “We're just hanging out here”? Am I saying, “I'm not frustrated” when the edge in my voice confirms the contrary?

The second is making changes in register evident with the right degree of emphasis and speed. The changes are subtle in Arielle’s and Denarius's classrooms. They might be less so in other cases.

Register shifts can also be useful when students have not responded as they should the first time. If a student fails to follow a direction, a good first response is to shift noticeably (that is, visibly and, if possible, audibly) into a more formal register, perhaps putting your hands behind your back and changing to a more symmetrical stance—a lot of teachers add a raised eyebrow here as if to show surprise—and then giving the directions again, modulating your voice and leaving a clear gap between each word, which suggests that you have chosen each ... word ... very ... carefully. “Please give me your eyes.” Once this is done you would likely shift back toward something more casual to show the moment is over, though you might retain a formal tone until you begin to see a response from your student.

To summarize: Do the core work of teaching in whatever balance of casual and formal that expresses your style, but when you need full attention, shift noticeably into formal register. And save your urgent register for the truly urgent.

One thing I've tried to do in this version of *Teach Like a Champion* is to show small techniques—things that happen in a moment and can be distorted with isolation—in the larger context of a keystone video, and I'd like to show you how BreOnna Tindall uses subtle and elegant register shifts throughout the Keystone from her lesson at Denver School of Science and Technology. One thing you'll notice is how often and how subtly she shifts registers to *help students perceive correctly and warmly* what is expected of them in any given moment. Her use of *Strong Voice* is a form of caring that she uses to help her students be successful in knowing what to do and study an inspiring book (*Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass*) without interruption or distraction. Her moves are subtle so I will describe them with time codes and still photos.

As the timer goes off at the beginning of the clip, you can see BreOnna walk to the corner of the room (Pastore's Perch; see [technique 53](#)). “That's time,” she says and, wanting to ensure she gets all eyes and ears for her upcoming directions, she “goes formal,” very briefly raising her chin, standing symmetrically, leaving a distinct space between each word as she speaks.

Here she is asking for eyes:

---

<!-- Page 795 -->

Even as she does this—you might argue *because* she does this, at least in part—she gets an eager and positive response from her students and you can hear her relax her tone slightly afterwards and include a tiny gesture that feels more casual as she says “with your face partner.”

Then students are off on their *Turn and Talk* ([technique 43](#)) where they are industrious and engaged. Her casual body language as she chats with students reaffirms this:

---

<!-- Page 796 -->

At 1:14 in the video, BreOnna calls an end to the *Turn and Talk*. Her first words are, “Check your SLANT” and her tone is casual here because she is reinforcing a habit almost everyone has been attentive to rather than issuing a reminder about an expectation some have neglected. Using a more casual register suggests this and implies that she assumes the best (see [technique 59](#), *Positive Framing*). If she were less happy with the level of follow-through, we might expect her request, “Check your SLANT,” to be accompanied by a clearer shift to greater formality.

In her next sentence, however, BreOnna edges toward slightly more formality. There's a brief pause where she uses *Radar and Be Seen Looking* ([technique 53](#)) to scan the room and ensure everyone listening for the coming direction. Again her upright and symmetrical body language suggests the importance of attention, so her words don't have to. She doesn't have to give a verbal

---

<!-- Page 797 -->

reminder because she is reinforcing the point nonverbally. Then she drops her voice and begins her next sentence, “We're gonna go ahead and track Adriel ...”

Her register shifts in the middle of the sentence, I'd argue. In the first half (above picture) it is formal—I need you with me; class is starting—but in the second half of her sentence—as she Cold Calls Adriel—you probably notice a distinct shift to the casual. This is because—as I interpret it—her body language is now signaling information about the Cold Call rather than the preceding direction. She wants to make sure it feels inclusive and positive to Adriel. In his book *Culturally Responsive Teaching in the Classroom*, Adeyemi Stembridge reminds us that how students perceive our actions is as important as how we intend them, and as you can see in the picture below, BreOnna's bright smile and relaxed posture as she asks Adriel's classmates to “snap it up” for him ensures her actions will be received as they are intended. She wants to diffuse any tension and ensure that Adriel feels support and sunshine from his classmates.

---

<!-- Page 798 -->

Adriel does well, and Breonna then *Cold Calls* Renee to “share her response.” Notice her casual body language just after she reminds the class in the most lilting of voices that they should be “Tracking Renee.” In *Running the Room*, Tom Bennett makes the point that behavioral reinforcements are most important to give when things are going well, as they certainly are here, because it allows us to build culture positively and preventatively. Again, the pairing of the reminder and a more casual register makes it easy for BreOnna to do that. Her mastery of register allows her to consistently reinforce expectations with just the right level of gentleness or emphasis.

Now here's BreOnna as Renee answers:

---

<!-- Page 799 -->

She's relaxed, standing small instead of standing tall, asymmetrical instead of symmetrical, because she is deflecting attention from herself. She wants students to be tracking their classmate. Notice also how doubly casual BreOnna is when she interrupts Renee to praise her use of the word “exonerated.” As she breaks in, she wants to reassure Renee and communicate immediately that the interruption is a good thing.

It’s a master class, frankly, in building not just loving positive culture but rigorous academic culture at the same time, and though you might not expect this to be a classroom where *Strong Voice* is key, among the sources of BreOnna’s success is her remarkable ability to shift registers to communicate nonverbally both her affection for students and the importance of their attention in critical moments.

## Principle 2: Show Both Shoulders/Stand Still

---

<!-- Page 800 -->

Many times when we give a direction, we communicate to listeners that the direction is an afterthought, because we appear to be doing something else while we give it. The message is *Something else is foremost in my mind relative to this direction*. If you are passing out papers while you direct students, you suggest that your directions aren’t that important. If you stop moving, you show that there is nothing more important than the direction you are giving. When you want directions to be followed, don’t engage in other tasks at the same time. It may even help to strike a formal pose.

You can see an example of this in the video of BreOnna Tindall. At about 3:25, BreOnna has wrapped up the discussion and is transitioning to the next task, introducing the passage the class will read during the day’s lesson.

“I’d like for us to be thinking about ‘blind justice,’” she says. But here she’s getting her materials ready and placing them on the projector. You’ll notice she starts to slow down her pace of diction, almost as if she’s stalling. She doesn’t want to engage the topic fully until she’s done with that task and can face students fully to show its importance.

Here’s what that moment looks like.

---

<!-- Page 801 -->

A few seconds later, however, she turns to face the class to frame the topic for the day. Suddenly it feels as if we are no longer in transition. Below is a still shot of BreOnna having turned to face the class fully to show that they, and the coming task, are her singular priority. Notice that students are now looking at her, whereas in the first image they were not. She's shown them that what she's saying to them is her priority and they've responded accordingly.

---

<!-- Page 802 -->

Another observation: when you learn to shoot a basketball, the first bit of advice you get is to square up^17 to the basket. It's hard to get the right result if you're not facing your objective fully. With human communication it's similar. You show what is important to you by facing it. Glance over your shoulder and say to David, *please put that away*, and you are saying that what you are facing with your shoulders is still more important to you. That may be fine for an off-hand reminder. Or it could help you surreptitiously give a student a reminder you want to keep as private as possible. But if you are not getting the follow-through you need from students, try facing them more intentionally as you give directions or if you must repeat them. In this way the orientation of your body reinforces the importance of your words.

Notice, too, Matthew Gray's body language in his lesson at the beginning of his class at Oasis South Bank. His class of Year Sixes has just arrived and are a bit fidgety. Matthew is careful to hold very still and face them as he gives directions. There's an air of formality; he is still and stands with both shoulders squared to the class throughout, no matter where he stands. Soon his class is focused and hard at work.

## Principle 3: Use Economy of Language

When you're communicating what you want students to do, strive to use the fewest words possible. Demonstrating Economy of Language shows students that you are prepared, composed, know your purpose in speaking, and that what you are saying is worth hearing. Conversely, when people are nervous, they tend to use more filler words as they decide what to say. Flip the script and start

---

<!-- Page 805 -->

using filler words and one outcome can be that you appear nervous.

Another benefit of Economy of Language is that it focuses listeners on the most important points of what you said, eliminating the distraction of unnecessary language.

When emotions are running high, and your students' thinking brains may be clouded with negative emotion, brevity can be a powerful ally. By keeping your directions simple and concise, you can cut through the brain fog wrought by an active limbic system and help students stay focused on the path forward. This simplicity and repetition is crucial, as researchers have found that when you're under duress, your emotions “swamp the thinking brain's capacity to focus” on even the simplest of tasks.18 Striving for Economy of Language can also discipline you to resist the temptation to engage in the kind of unnecessary argument and debate that can make a tense situation worse.

To be clear, I am not suggesting that you need to use Economy of Language when you are discussing anaerobic respiration or the last chapter of *Lord of the Flies*—just when you're discussing behavior and when there are potential distractions. If anything, maintaining Economy of Language when you're correcting unproductive behavior or giving directions helps you conserve your time, words, and energy for such academic instruction.

Most of the Keystone clips contain examples of strong Economy of Language in critical moments, particularly the start of class or a transition where the teacher wants to maintain energy and momentum. Nicole Warren is a good example; her bright joyful energy is emphasized by her choice of few words when students are getting started with the lesson: “Eyes up here ... waiting on one ... tell your partner ...” Or Jessica Bracey, who transitions from Omar to

---

<!-- Page 806 -->

Danielle amidst a remarkable discussion by saying, “Habits of Discussion … Paraphrase … push it even further. Please track … Danielle.” She can't build *Habits of Discussion* (technique 44) without reminding students to use them and in particular to remember to restate Omar's point. She wants to call on Danielle. She wants to remind students to direct their eyes to the speaker. All of these things are important but she does not want to disrupt the momentum or distract from Omar's excellent comment, so she uses tiny reminder phrases. Ten words and perhaps three seconds and she's done it all.

## Principle 4: Quiet Presence

There's a tendency to think that louder is stronger, but this is usually not the case. For the most part, raised voices rarely correlate with better listening. You give a direction but there's a background noise of talking and shuffling of papers, for example. You increase your voice level to be heard above the bustle, but students get a little louder, too, and suddenly you sound like you are speaking through a bullhorn.

Going louder emphasizes the clamor and suggests to students that things are unraveling. Often raising your voice will increase the sense of tension, especially if you are speaking at a faster pace, too. If there is an opportunist in the group, this may signal that that you're getting flustered, and he or she may take the opportunity to goad you a bit—to see how flustered you'll get. Better to set out to modulate your voice as much as possible from the beginning or to progressively modulate it as you speak. If students are already noisy, starting to speak and then self-interrupting (see further on) can help you do that—to gain students' attention while demonstrating that you won't talk over noise. But often it's we who start the process. We speak in voices that suggest they expect to be broadcast

---

<!-- Page 807 -->

over a bed of noise. As if we are anticipating it. And in that case the anticipated noise is usually not far behind.

The best tool of prevention, however, is to help students to build a habit of listening to and listening for information that comes quietly from the outset. We want students to consistently associate quiet voices with attentiveness.

Notice, for example, how Arielle Hoo does this in the register shift clip at the beginning of the chapter. “Great, and track up here in five, four …” she begins. Her voice is a bit louder than her normal speaking voice here. Not a shout, certainly, but projected enough to make sure everyone knows she's speaking and looks up. But notice also the way her voice drops, even over the brief length of the countdown. By the time she's at “one” she's speaking at a conversational volume. She uses the shortest possible spike in volume; it's momentary and by the time her phrase ends she has already returned to speaking volume. From there she gets even quieter. Her final direction, *Make sure books are closed*, is at a very low volume but by this time students are listening attentively. If a tiny bit of raised volume helps you draw eyes, it helps best when it is a tiny burst, a fraction of a second. Once that's happened its work is done and Arielle, for one, is always trying to move toward quiet. Her voice drop to a near-whisper is also an investment in the future. *She wants students to make a habit of listening to and for information delivered quietly.*

When you want students to listen and follow through on an important request, especially when emotions are running high, strive to exude *Quiet Presence*. If you have to raise your voice slightly at first to show you are speaking, modulate quickly to a lower volume. Drop your pitch and speak more quietly even as you progress through a single sentence. Speak slowly and calmly; again, slowing yourself even over the course of the sentence if necessary. This

---

<!-- Page 808 -->

helps you bring a calming effect to students in an escalating situation. And to yourself. Teachers often find that making a habit of using Quiet Presence, of always working toward quiet like Arielle does, helps them tamp down their emotions. You feel calmer because you speak more calmly and this help ensure that the interaction ends successfully.

You can see an excellent example of how speaking quietly and slowly signals caring and focus to students in Emily Bisso's lovely interaction with a student, Joshua, in *Emily Bisso: Write What I Write*. As the clip opens, Joshua is eagerly seeking Emily's attention to the detriment of his note-taking. It's counterproductive but also signals a student with whom she has a positive and caring relationship. She'd like to preserve that, not to mention Joshua's feelings. As Joshua waves his paper at her, Emily lowers her voice and uses impeccable economy of language. She “lives in the now” (see technique 59, *Positive Framing*) as well in describing what the solution looks like in the very next moment. “Write what I write, Joshua. Thank you, sweetie.” Receiving the signal that Emily is seeking to communicate her corrective guidance privately and quietly, and hearing the opposite of tension in the calm steadiness of her voice, Joshua returns happily to his work.

**Principle 5: Self-Interrupt (Formerly *Do Not Talk Over*)**

If what you're saying is worth students' attention—you are explaining the task they need to complete for the next six minutes or explaining the symbolism of the conch in *Lord of the Flies*—every student has the right to hear and the responsibility to allow others to do so. If students cannot hear you say these things, they cannot complete learning tasks or understand what they need to understand to succeed. Not every utterance you make in the classroom

---

<!-- Page 809 -->

has this level of importance, but it remains true that being able to hear the teacher—and not talking while the teacher is talking—is an equity issue. The costs of even low-level disruptions (as discussed in the introduction to this chapter) are both massive and most likely to be paid by students already in suboptimal settings or most prone to distraction. “One of the reasons we get students' attention is to give them the opportunity to be successful at a task,” my colleague Darryl Williams reminded me. There are times, in other words, when your words are the most important in the room, and you must be able to ensure that they do not compete for attention with other voices.

In many cases, the solution is to start in order to stop—that is, start a sentence and break it off, even in the middle of a word, to show that you do not yet have full attention. This is called a self-interrupt. The noticeable break makes the explanation—I have stopped talking because not everyone is listening and right now you must listen—unnecessary. A brief pause and an effort to proceed again is often all that's required. Sometimes a second start-then-stop is required. Sometimes breaking mid-word to make the pause more evident is surprisingly effective. Adding a shift in register helps, too. But used consistently and used early—before it is attempting to compete with the auditory equivalent of Times Square—this technique is one of the most useful and simple tricks in a teacher's arsenal.

Laura Fern models this beautifully in the video *Self-Interrupt Montage*. She's cheery and bright, walking across the front of the classroom as she responds to a student, “That's excellent, Cameron. That's one way that while bo—” A student in the front row is mesmerized by the camera and is no longer listening. He's lost the lesson. But hearing the sudden and unexpected break in Laura's voice causes him to turn face forward, to return to the math. Notice that there's no lecture here for him. The break itself brings him

---

<!-- Page 810 -->

back. Notice how much the unexpectedness of it calls his attention. Putting the break in the middle of a word—as opposed to just after one—maximizes this effect. Notice also how Laura's body freezes. Her face goes very briefly expressionless and formal as she pauses, but a warmer expression replaces that “teacher look” when her student refocuses, and a second or so later she's back to teaching with the problem solved. (Notice, though, how she uses a **confirmation glance** afterwards to double-check that he remains focused.) Also in the montage you can see Eric Snider self-interrupting with his middle school students (and thus sparing them the lecture) as well as Sadie McCleary using the technique with high school students.

## Principle 6: Time and Place (Formerly *Do Not Engage*)

There are times when we initiate a topic of discussion with students that requires timely resolution on their part. There are times when those students may wish to avoid the timely resolution. Changing the subject is often one way to do that. This action may be deliberate or accidental, the result of distraction, intense emotion, or perhaps a bit of strategy.

Here's one example:

*Teacher:* James, we don't laugh when a classmate struggles. Please move your card to yellow.  
*James:* It wasn't me!  
*Teacher:* Please move your card to yellow.  
*James:* Shannon was laughing! Not me!  
*Teacher:* If you think I am mistaken you may discuss with me after class. Please get up and move your card to yellow.

It may be reasonable for the teacher to discuss who was talking with James, but the expectation needs to be that the

---

<!-- Page 811 -->

latter conversation doesn't happen until James has first done what his teacher asked. That's why the name for this principle is *Time and Place*. Sometimes the things students would rather discuss are frivolous. Sometimes they are legitimate. But the time and place for them is rarely when you have just asked them to do something else or when you are trying to attend to the needs of thirty classmates.

Either way, *Time and Place* is the skill of not engaging a new topic until you have achieved resolution on the one you've suggested.

One of my favorite examples of *Time and Place* is this example from Christy Lundy's classroom. Note the light circle. There's some drama afoot (sorry for the pun) and Christy can't see it! She calls on Patience, whose goal in answering, it soon turns out, has more to do with the kicking battle than anything having to do with *The Mouse and the Motorcycle*. “He's kicking me!” she states. An argument ensues.

We've all been there and we all know where this sort of situation can go. It's not bringing us back to the Beverly Cleary novel any time soon. Yes, Christy's students feel the situation keenly. The emotions are real. And also, yes, it is a distraction—the kind of thing that waylays a lesson and the kind of thing students who would rather not read can learn: *If I can create some drama right now, I will not have to do the work.* You will meet this student at least once in your career. She deserves a teacher who will ensure that she does the work. It's not the time and place, in other words.

“Three ... two ... one,” says Christy, the brief short countdown giving Patience a bit of time to compose herself. Just a bit of space. She's has done two things here: She's reminded Patience that there is an appropriate time to discuss the issue. She doesn't dismiss Patience's complaint; she just needs her to understand that it will have to wait till

---

<!-- Page 812 -->

later. Then she returns Patience to the task: “You need to answer my question.” Patience, it turns out, is capable of putting the kicking behind her. It wasn’t perhaps the crisis it appeared to be, and Christy rewards her with a bright, warm smile. Notice also the impeccable Economy of Language Christy uses. “Three … two … one. Inappropriate time. You need to answer my question.” It takes only ten words to resolve the crisis. Twenty words would probably do the opposite.

## Notes

1. This term is discussed in the Preface to this edition. Roughly it describes a caregiver’s tendency to give lower-quality treatment to a patient rather than one harder to administer but preferential on the grounds that it is in the patient’s interests.

2. I don’t mean the young people themselves; I mean the behaviors they may manifest. I don’t believe in the fixity of traits and propose instead that the overwhelming majority of students will show grace, curiosity, and virtue if we build classrooms that socialize those things intentionally enough.

At the end of the week students might purchase special items (lunch with a teacher for them and three friends, for example)
