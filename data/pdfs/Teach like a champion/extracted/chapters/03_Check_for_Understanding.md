# Chapter 3
## Check for Understanding

The great basketball coach John Wooden—a former English teacher before he won ten NCAA championships in twelve years at UCLA—defined teaching as knowing the difference between “I taught it” and “they learned it.” Part of what’s so profound about this perfect expression of the core challenge of teaching—in any setting—is its calm presumption that errors will emerge. It is not whether, but when. Every teacher seeks to present material clearly and memorably so that their students grasp meaning and importance. You want the initial presentation to be as good as it can be, but mopping up afterwards is inevitable. No matter how well you explain or demonstrate the material, gaps in understanding will emerge. It’s what you do next, how you respond to errors, that matters most. Will you see misunderstandings? Will you ignore them? Can you fix them? Will you blame students and express your frustration? There will be a gap between what you taught and what they understood. Regardless of why it will be your job to fix it.

With that in mind I can safely say that one of the most useful teaching videos you’re likely to see is *Denarius Frazier: Remainder*. It’s a thing of quiet beauty and I’ll discuss it extensively in this chapter. But for now here’s a brief overview and some highlights.

The video starts with students hard at work on a pair of problems. Denarius wants to use the independent work to gauge how his students are doing, so he begins to go from student to student to observe their work. Quickly he assesses where each student is and provides useful and

supporting feedback. “[You're] killing it,” he tells one young man. “Keep going,” he tells a young woman. “Make sure you have the remainder and the quotient.”

“What's going on here?” he asks the next young woman, and spots the fact that her digits are not lined up. A few seats later he tells one young woman quickly, “Oh, much better, thank you,” affirming both her progress and his own awareness of the progress of her learning.

As he works, Denarius is able to assess not only the progress of individuals but also of the class. The class is dividing polynomials and the most frequent issue is lack of clarity about how to find the remainder. He pauses, presents an example to the class, guides them through an analysis of where it was effective and where it went wrong, and sends them back to their quiet, productive practice.

Every student feels seen and supported. It is evident that their teacher can and will help them succeed. It's a case study in how effective teaching builds relationships. Because Denarius is alert to gaps in understanding as they emerge, he is able to help each student, calmly and steadily, and create an environment of trust and respect. The trust, as I argued in Chapter One, is not a precondition to Denarius teaching them, but in many ways an outcome. At the very least the two develop in synergy. You teach me well and I will come to have faith in you.

This chapter is about the gap between teaching and learning: about how to see it, how to respond to it, and how to make students comfortable with the struggle it implies. It's going to be technical stuff. What should you look at and look for? How can you respond to mistakes? How can you get students to reveal misunderstandings to you willingly? But don't be fooled. The consequences of a teacher mastering such technical details are not arcane. As

Denarius shows, they create the conditions under which students thrive.

## TECHNIQUE 6: REPLACE SELF-REPORT

One of the most common methods teachers use to find out whether their students understand what they've been teaching is to ask them directly, “Do you understand?” This seems logical enough, but it turns out to be a relatively ineffective (if easily improved upon) way to assess student understanding.

Let's say a science teacher has just finished explaining cellular structure to her sixth graders. “OK,” she says, “those are the basics of cellular structure. Does everyone understand?” Or perhaps she's a bit more specific: “Is everyone clear on the differences between plant and animal cells?”

She'd likely get what seems like confirmation: mutters and nods from a smattering of students. Perhaps a “yeah” or “uh-huh,” though perhaps she won't hear anything. Either way, she's likely to take it as evidence that students are with her—call it *apparent assent*—and say something like: “Good. Let's push on to the role of chloroplasts.”

But questions that ask students to evaluate their own understanding of something they've just learned tend to yield false confirmation—especially when they are framed as a yes/no question. The primary reason for this is that the questions rely on self-report, which is notoriously inaccurate. People, especially novices, often don't know what they don't know about a topic, and even if they do they are often unlikely to acknowledge it when asked.

If, for example, you ask a group of students, “Are you clear on the causes of the American Revolution?” and everyone says yes, it is because they are clear on the causes they are

---

<!-- Page 180 -->

aware of knowing about at the moment. If they missed some, if their conception contains misinformation, they won't know it without some way of checking themselves against a fuller description of the concepts they should know and which, to you, are implicit in the question. Ironically, someone with deep understanding of the causes of the Revolution is more likely to answer in the negative: “I still don't totally understand why the Intolerable Acts unified dissent rather than isolating colonial radicals ...”

Ask me, a novice, “Are you clear on the differences between plant and animal cells?” and really you are asking me, “Are you aware of some differences between plant and animal cells?” or “Are you aware that there are differences between plant and animal cells?” “Yes,” I will tell you, as I think of those things I do know which come readily to mind. They are shaped differently and plant cells have a cell wall that's relatively inflexible, I think. *Got it.* As I tell you this, though, I remain unaware that the nucleus is positioned differently within the cell, and I have no idea what lysosomes are. My honest answer is yes, but I don't know what I don't know. Sadly then, the less your students know about a topic, the more likely their *apparent assent* is to be inaccurate.

However, even this example presumes that I am trying very hard to share everything I know about plant and animal cells with you, my teacher. Just as often there are social and psychological barriers that prevent students from revealing their confusion. Let's say that I am aware that I didn't understand the difference between plant and animal cells. Saying “Actually, I don't know” means stopping the room—causing the teacher to go back and re-explain, when the presumption is clearly that she and my classmates do not want to. It means appearing to be, possibly, the only person in the room who didn't get it. Or the only person in the room who doesn't get that you’re not supposed to say

---

<!-- Page 181 -->

you don’t get it. All this for the uncertainty that the re-explanation will really help. It’s easier just to tell myself I’ll figure it out on my own. Such factors prevent most people, not just students, from speaking up when they are confused. When was the last time you stopped the room during a meeting to say, “Wait, I don’t get it”? If a colleague did this, what are the odds that you felt (or expressed) appreciation rather than exasperation? Students may occasionally say, “No, I don’t get it,” but not reliably so. There are too many implicit social pressures pushing them to keep their confusion to themselves.

A final factor that makes “Everybody get it?” questions ineffective is the format of the questions. They offer two bad choices. In most cases students’ understanding is somewhere in the middle; whether they get “it” is actually a series of questions in which the answer is yes to some and no to others. The answer to a yes/no “Do you get it?” question requires the conflation of a lot of data points; it causes students to choose one oversimplification or the other.

The good news is that when we ask questions like “Everybody get it?” we are recognizing that we are at a point when it would be beneficial to check for understanding. If we notice when we ask these sorts of questions, we can replace them with some more productive alternatives, what I call “targeted questions,” specific, objective questions focused on the content in question and asked in an open-ended format.

Imagine for a moment that our sixth-grade science teacher notices herself saying “Everybody get it?” during her introduction to plant and animal cell differences and tries to replace that question with something better. She might then say:

---

<!-- Page 182 -->

"OK, let's just check a few of the key ideas. If I was looking at a photograph of some cells and they were rounded and spaced randomly, would I be looking at plant or animal cells? Jasmine?"

"Good, and if I were looking at plant cells, what would cause them to have a more rectangular pattern? Louis?"

"Great. So which types of cells have a membrane, Kelsey, plant cells, animal cells, or both?"

"Good. Finally, Shawn, what are lysosomes and which kinds of cells would I find them in?"

1. First, you'll notice that our science teacher's questions are now objective. They don't ask whether students *think* they know, they ask them to *demonstrate* if they do, so the accuracy of the data is now far better.

2. Second, these are not yes/no questions. This makes it harder to guess the right answer or to get it right with only the most basic understanding.

One common solution to the problem of apparent assent is worth being wary of. Many teachers try to replace the yes/no question with a signal from students: *Thumbs up if you understand the differences between plant and animal cell structure, thumbs down if you don't, thumbs sideways if you're not sure.* This may seem like an improvement—you're likely to get more responses from students—but the problems of self-report remain—you're still relying on students' perception of whether they know something and the fact is, even if they're totally honest, many are probably still wrong on that account. Putting your thumb up or down may make the self-report more engaging and thus remove some of the awkward silence but in terms of giving you better data on your students' understanding, it's mostly an illusion. Targeted questions are far better.

---

<!-- Page 183 -->

Targeted questions work best when you plan them in advance, by the way. It's hard to think of the four questions that will quickly reveal where your students stand on the spur of the moment. And if you're trying to think of the next question you won't be able to listen to the answers very well. Or to think about your tone of voice. That's important because if you asked targeted questions in an environment where, say, you smiled warmly to show that getting it wrong would not make you frustrated, then you would make the opportunity to check for understanding more productive. Smiling when you ask your targeted question or perhaps when students struggle to answer reminds your class that you want honesty and that knowing about misconceptions early makes them easier to fix. This is a topic I will discuss further in *technique 12*, *Culture of Error*.

There's one other thing that will help you ensure that your students succeed: *Cold Calling* (see *technique 34*). This technique allows you to gather data from a sample of students from around the room. If you rely instead only on students who volunteer to answer, you will gather erroneous data. Students who volunteer to answer mostly do so when they think they know. Students who don't think they know are less likely to raise their hands. Unless you find a way to call on those pupils, you will always overestimate the proportion of your class that understands a concept.

*Cold Calling* also helps in another way. It helps you to move quickly through your questions. That might seem counterintuitive; wouldn't a teacher want to assess as thoroughly as possible? But one reason why teachers so routinely recognize the need to check for understanding but fail to act on it—or act on it in a cursory way—is time pressure. There's never enough time, as you know if you're a teacher, and taking five minutes to circle back to double-

---

<!-- Page 184 -->

check that everyone understands is stressful when you have ground to cover. If it takes forever and disrupts your pacing, or causes you to drop the last activity of your lesson plan, *of course* you won't do it. But if you could double-check in thirty seconds then you might really do it, so one of the keys to replacing self-report with targeted questions is to do it quickly—ideally in less than a minute. If (and only if) you can do it fast will you be likely to do it often. So even if it yields imperfect data, seek to gather what you can through the best questions you can design in a minute or less. You can use the remaining time to review if necessary.

Asking targeted questions can be just as valuable for assessing understanding of *tasks students are about to do* as it is for assessing understanding of *content you've just taught*. If you're sending students off for eight minutes of independent or partner work, it's really good to ask them a few targeted questions about the task so that you don't find out halfway through that they weren't really clear on how to write up their discussion notes or even that they had to write them. Generally speaking, the longer the task you are sending students off to do, the more important it is to assess their clarity on the task beforehand via targeted questions.

Recently I observed a lesson where a teacher wanted her students to read a text, note phrases and phrasings that were intentionally repetitive, and track shifts in who the implicit audience was. They were supposed to work solo for five minutes and then discuss with a partner.

Before she sent students off to do this task, she asked them targeted questions to review. It took her about twenty seconds and she used *Cold Call* to ensure that she wasn't just calling on the kids who thought they knew:

> **Teacher**: Nelson, tell me the two things I want you to look for while you're reading this.

---

<!-- Page 185 -->

**Nelson:** Repetition and shifts in audience.

**Teacher:** Good, and Tina, what should you do when you see examples of repetition?

**Tina:** Box them in the text.

**Teacher:** Yup. Nice. And Gary, is this partner work or independent work?

**Gary:** First by ourselves, then, after five minutes, work with a partner.

**Teacher:** Perfect. Off you go.

It would be so easy to have some portion of the class set off earnestly but do the wrong task! Ten minutes spent on a task for thirty students is *five hours of learning time* allocated with a single set of directions! Replacing “Everyone understand what we're doing?” with targeted questions is a smart investment.

It’s crucial to remember that the goal of targeted questions isn’t to be comprehensive but to create a small data sample where previously no data existed. It’s often better to be quick and bring data to multiple places in your lesson than to be comprehensive and exhaustive, but assess infrequently.

You might be wondering if this means you’re doing something wrong if you still occasionally ask students, “Got it?” or “Everybody clear on that?” Don’t worry. There’s no reason to be absolutist; you will almost assuredly say those phrases sometimes (I know I do); it’s almost impossible to root out familiar rhetorical habits and if you did, the self-consciousness it requires might be a distraction. It’s just important to recognize *how often* we use self-report and how much of an illusion it creates. When you use such phrases you are telling yourself: *I have reached a natural transition point where I should check in with students and*

---

<!-- Page 186 -->

*find out how they are doing.* Hopefully in the aggregate that consciousness can be curative.

The video *Gabby Woolf: Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde* shows an interesting adaptation of *Replace Self-Report*. If you're not familiar with it, Robert Louis Stevenson's novella is a challenging read. For example, the passage Gabby was reading with her Year 10 class at London's King Solomon Academy begins: “Nearly a year later, in the month of October, 18—, London was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling.”

Gabby and her students read the passage aloud—you can hear them doing a lovely job reading it via FASE Reading in the clip *Gabby Woolf: Keystone*—and because of its complexity, Gabby paused after reading and told the class she wanted to “check that you understand.” She then projected a series of short targeted questions on the board and gave students a minute or so to review the answers in pairs. The questions were straightforward and designed to yield short answers that revealed student understanding (or the lack of it) quickly:

- “What month did the murder take place in?”
- “Why was London particularly startled by the victim?”
- “Who saw the murder?”
- “Where did she see the murder from?
- “Who is the murderer?”

Gabby wanted to ensure that despite archaic syntax such as “singular ferocity” and “rendered all the more notable” they had grasped the critical details of what had taken place.

---

<!-- Page 187 -->

You can see her reviewing these answers with her students in the video. Notice her warm tone and brisk pace. Her constant encouragement—“OK, good”—and the way her *Cold Call* keeps the pace moving allows her to sample a cross-section of students. She also slows the pace of her speech a bit to imply a slightly more reflective tone when she transitions: “Good, so we get the picture of what’s happened. Now go back to this question: How does Stevenson sensationalize the murder?”

Had Gabby asked this question without first checking for understanding, students might have engaged in the analysis confused about basic facts. But her questions, planned in advance for precision and speed, allow her to ensure that they are ready for a deeper discussion. The pair review prior to her questions also has the effect of allowing students to encode the answers more strongly in memory. And her tone is warm and her pace brisk, so she accomplishes the whole thing in about a minute.

# TECHNIQUE 7: RETRIEVAL PRACTICE

Forgetting is a constant problem in almost any setting that involves learning—so familiar and pervasive that we almost overlook it. Hours after demonstrating their understanding of juxtaposition in *Romeo and Juliet* or how to find the area of an irregular polygon, students may remember only a fraction of that knowledge. In a few days, they may have forgotten the majority of it. This simple if frequently overlooked fact is one of the most important considerations in teaching: Once students have initially learned something, they quickly begin to forget it.

You have probably seen this play out in your own classroom. On Tuesday you are confident in your students' skill and knowledge. They’re solid on the what, why, and how. But when you assess them a week and a half later, it’s

---

<!-- Page 188 -->

as if Tuesday's lesson never happened. Then, Rodrigo completed five complex area problems with ease; now you glance over his shoulder and see that he has gotten even simple problems wrong.

There is a silver lining, however, to this persistent challenge. The process of forgetting contains the seeds of its own solution. If you ask students to recall what they learned yesterday about the area of polygons or juxtaposition in *Romeo and Juliet* they will strain to remember but if successful, that struggle will more deeply encode the material in their long-term memories. They will remember a little more and forget a little less quickly.

*Retrieval Practice*, or the process of causing students to recall information they've learned after a strategic delay, is a practical solution to the problem of forgetting. If you graphed the process of retrieval practice it might look something like this, with each repetition along the top axis an iteration of retrieval practice and the percentages on the y-axis representing how much of a given body of content students remember.

---

<!-- Page 189 -->

This illustration is an example of what's called a forgetting curve.¹ It represents the nature of forgetting as educational psychologists understand it. At point 1, the end of your lesson, students have acquired a certain amount of knowledge and skills. But as soon as the bell rings, the forgetting begins. And forgetting is a relentless enemy. Even a few minutes later some of the details will have gotten hazy. By the next day students will have forgotten even more—possibly more than half of what they learned. If steps aren't taken to arrest this process, they may lose most of what they know. On the curve, the process of unchecked forgetting is represented by line A.

Point 2, however, represents what happens when you come back to the content and review it. Perhaps this happens the next day. When you do so, students' knowledge is recalled

---

<!-- Page 190 -->

into working memory. Having done so, their knowledge of it returns roughly to the level it was at by the end of the original lesson.

Of course, after this review, forgetting begins again. What students know again starts to slip away. The second downward sloping line (B) captures this. But the rate of forgetting is slower now and the line starts to flatten sooner—which suggests that more remains in long-term memory. If you review again, knowledge is refreshed and forgetting again resumes immediately after—represented by line C—but again the rate is slower yet and the floor (total amount of knowledge retained) is higher still.

As the cognitive psychologists Paul Kirschner, John Sweller, and Richard Clark write: “The aim of all instruction is to alter long-term memory. If nothing has changed in long-term memory, nothing has been learned.”2 If we spent an hour studying the systems of the human body only to have students forget it—a day later, a week later, a month later—then the lesson might have been interesting and engaging, but students would have learned precious little. Even the deepest and most profound discussions remain at risk of evaporating as if into ether. As Harry Fletcher Wood puts it, “Student performance while being taught is a poor indicator of lasting learning.” We should by all means check for understanding at the end of a lesson. But just because students appear to know something at the end of that hour does not mean they will know it in a week, a month, or a year. If we want lasting learning, we have to get things into long-term memory, and retrieval practice is the best way to do that.

Since the concept of *Retrieval Practice* is discussed throughout cognitive psychology in a wide variety of contexts, the following is a useful “teacher's definition.”

---

<!-- Page 191 -->

# Retrieval Practice

Retrieval Practice occurs when learners recall and apply multiple examples of previously learned knowledge or skills after a period of forgetting. This definition suggests two key things.

## First: Intentionality

You might say, “Oh, asking kids about concepts we previously learned? I do that all the time,” but what we're talking about here is more than just occasional episodic review—“Remember how we talked about juxtaposition when we read *Romeo and Juliet*?” It's the strategic use of retrieval, systematically and regularly. This might even mean *Retrieval Practice* becomes a discrete part of your lessons—a chunk of time you design with the explicit purpose of causing students to recall important things in strategic ways, probably using tools like *Cold Call* and *Call and Response* to ensure that every student recalls the requisite information. Retrieval in these settings need not be simplistic or rote. A bit of challenge is beneficial, so changing formats or asking students to apply concepts in new ways is likely to help.

## Second: Strategic Delay

Notice on the Forgetting Curve that the delay between rounds of retrieval increases slightly each time. Gradually increasing the intervals between rounds of retrieval aids memory because the best time to remember something is when you have begun to forget it, and the rate of our forgetting is constantly changing. And if nothing else, a glance at the Forgetting Curve should confirm that it is almost impossible to master a concept in a durable and enduring way in a single lesson.³

You might be tempted to think of *Retrieval Practice* as a recipe for mere rote memorization, but this is not the case. Retrieval is an opportunity for what Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel call “elaboration”: connecting an idea to other ideas, reflecting on it, and expanding it as you review it. Elaboration aids in retrieval, in fact.⁴ When a concept is connected to other related ideas and when students can

---

<!-- Page 192 -->

describe it in different ways, it becomes more powerful. So you might, in reviewing juxtaposition, deliberately ask for elaboration. “Asha, what's juxtaposition? Darius, what's an example from *Romeo and Juliet*? Katie, what's another? Roberto, what's another example of two characters who are juxtaposed from something else we've read? Good, and Kyra, in your own words, why might an author use juxtaposition?” The elaboration, causing students to explain and put into new words, to make connections, increases their knowledge of the concept and the likelihood that they will remember it when they need it.

The first half of the video *Christine Torres: Keystone* is a great example of other ways that *Retrieval Practice* can work. Christine is reviewing vocabulary words with students. Notice the richness of the questions Christine asks. *Retrieval Practice* questions don't have to be simple recall. Christine asks her students to apply the vocabulary words they're learning in different ways and new settings. That's important, because words work differently in different settings. To truly understand a word, you'd want students to constantly encounter it in all its nuanced shades of meaning. Christine asks students to know the definition, but also to apply the word in challenging and interesting ways. It's both simple and more elaborated retrieval. Christine makes sure that every student wrestles with almost every question. She uses *Turn and Talk* (see technique 43). For retrieval practice, we can't just take hands from volunteers or let a few highly verbal kids call out answers. We need to cause everyone to remember and apply the concept.

Interestingly, the period of delay between initial learning and retrieval is short in Christine's classroom. Forgetting, she knows, starts right away. With challenging and potentially confusing concepts, especially, it's not too soon to begin retrieving right away. So even though students

---

<!-- Page 193 -->

learned what the words meant just a few minutes ago, Christine is already trying to get them into long-term memory. And Christine will be sure to follow up the next day and/or a few days later—and again a few days after that—with more fun and engaging questions to retrieve and apply their knowledge of their vocabulary words. She also frequently includes previously mastered vocabulary words when she's retrieving new words. In this way they will have both depth and richness of understanding and long-term memory of the words.

It's not just that *more* of the original material remains in long-term memory that matters with *Retrieval Practice*. It's that the knowledge that is there is *easier for students to recall*. After three rounds of review, the neural pathways back to those discussions about juxtaposition in *Romeo and Juliet*, for example, are well worn. When students come upon an example of juxtaposition in some other text they are reading, the examples from Shakespeare will snap readily to mind. They will form connections. Easier retrieval leads to more than just knowing facts, in other words. Having various models of juxtaposition that come easily and naturally to mind becomes a schema—a connected body of knowledge that becomes familiar enough that people can use it quickly and easily to process information at minimal load to working memory as they interact with the world around them. Knowledge in that form—encoded in long-term memory and easily accessed—helps students perceive and understand more. This is one key reason why educational psychologists like Daniel Willingham remind us that knowledge easily accessed in long-term memory is the key to higher-order thinking.5 The best way to maximize the capacity of working memory for higher-order thinking, as I discussed in **Chapter One**, is to give it access to lots of ideas in long-term memory that it can draw upon.6

<!-- Page 194 -->

You can see some unexpected benefits of retrieval practice in the video Lauren Moyle: *Cranium*. Lauren here is asking her first-grade students to retrieve into active memory key details about the body. The brain is an *essential* organ that controls our decision making. It is encased in a bone called the cranium. The heart is a *pump* that distributes blood to the body like an engine. You can see them recalling the pieces of this content in different ways: What's it called, Why is it called that, What does it do? Every child is engaged with the task.

Interestingly this video is about ten years old and only recently did I come to understand it! We used to show it at workshops, inspired by Lauren's dynamic teaching—the questioning that fostered eager hands supported by the use of *Cold Call* and with *No Opt Out*, to ensure accountability and engagement. We were focused on *how* Lauren taught and didn't spend much time thinking about the value of *what* she was doing. In fact, ironically, when *what* she was teaching came up in discussions at workshops, I often found myself apologizing for it. Participants would occasionally note that she was *just recalling facts*, the phrase implying there wasn't much substantive teaching going on. Eventually we stopped showing the video altogether.

Now I can see much more clearly that *what* Lauren is doing is at least as valuable as *how* she's doing it. Future discussions in her class will be richer and based on firm knowledge because of *what* she does here. The other unexpected thing the video shows is how much students tend to like *Retrieval Practice*. Lauren's students are eager, happy, and confident. Teachers sometimes presume that facts are boring for students and so focusing on retrieval practice will make their classes dull, but the opposite is often the case. Students who know their material are proud to know it and eager to use it. And as they begin they see

---

<!-- Page 195 -->

examples of what they know in more and more places, their confidence grows, often transferring to more complicated tasks in which they are asked to put those facts to use.

I'll close the discussion of *Retrieval Practice* by sharing a video, *Retrieval Practice Montage*, of several teachers employing the concept in different ways. Art Worrell's AP U.S. History students stand to answer his retrieval questions. It's a regular and intentional part of the day and the importance of *Retrieval Practice* is transparent to students. This helps them to understand how important it is for them to use in their own studying! Art again undercuts the idea that *Retrieval Practice* questions have to be simple. He asks Tarik what the compromise of 1877 was, but also why it was important. He then asks Kamari to expand on Tarik's answer. As Kamari's answer shows, it's broad knowledge, not just narrow facts, that they're recalling.

Annette Riffle uses *Retrieval Practice* in her middle school math classroom to make ideal use of what might otherwise be down time—one student is at the board modeling a problem and, rather than allowing everyone else to sit passively, she peppers them with key questions about coordinate geometry.

Barry Smith's use of *Retrieval Practice* in his French class shows two things: first, a variety of ways to engage—*Cold Call*, *Call and Response*, hands raised—and also that the content goes in two directions. Barry asks his students to go both from French to English and English to French. Teachers of other content areas might think about naming a concept and asking students to describe it and then flipping the process: describing a concept and asking students to name it, asking, for example, “What is hyperbole?”; “What is it called when authors intentionally exaggerate to make a point?”; and perhaps even “If I say

<!-- Page 196 -->

I've got a million things to do today, what literary device am I using?" All of these strengthen the neural pathway.

Finally, Alonte Johnson reminds us in his literature classroom that we can ask students to retrieve a full range of content types: plot, character, background knowledge, and even themes.

# TECHNIQUE 8: STANDARDIZE THE FORMAT

Though asking questions of students is a great tool to check for understanding, gathering data through observation is arguably even more effective when you can use it. One major benefit of relying on observation to assess student understanding is that it allows you to respond quickly to more complex ideas in more formats than you can assess through questioning alone. Another benefit is that you can “parallel-process”—you can be checking for understanding while students are working. For example, you can quickly observe the quality of your students' thesis paragraphs as they are writing them.

But the greatest advantage of gathering data through observation is its efficiency. Done well it allows you to gather data quickly and about everyone. This is important because gathering data in the midst of instruction is almost always subject to significant time constraints. Say you assign independent work to students for five minutes. By the time you've given students a chance to get started, have answered their questions, and checked to make sure everyone has gotten underway, you might have three minutes to assess thirty students—six seconds per student on average. Many teachers might successfully assess ten students in that amount of time but if you can gather information twice as fast with half as many distractions,

---

<!-- Page 197 -->

you suddenly become able to assess and respond to students in situations where you weren't previously able to. Suddenly six minutes is enough. In some cases two or three minutes can be profoundly useful. If you maximize the efficiency of data gathering, you also increase the times and places when you can use it without redesigning your lessons. You become able to assess what happens during parts of your lesson that might otherwise go unmonitored. So while efficiency might seem at first like one of the least compelling words in teaching, it turns out to be critical to many of the most important things that differentiate great lessons from others.

*Standardize the Format* focuses on streamlining data-gathering and making your observation more efficient and accurate. It means designing materials and space so that you're looking predictably—in the same, consistent place every time—for the data you need. You might ask for work to be shown in the margin of a specific page of your students' books, for example, or for students to circle their final answer to a problem set. Or, at the beginning of class, you might give students a “packet” (see *technique 4*, *Double Plan*) in which to do key aspects of their work that day, and include clearly visible, preset places to write or take notes.

The following details from lesson packets in the Reading Reconsidered Curriculum my team and I developed offer some examples of ways carefully designed materials can organize the space where students work to make observation and assessment easier.

Her T.V. is color and big and all her pretty furniture is made out of red fur like the teddy bears they give away in carnivals. She has them covered with plastic. I think this is on account of the baby.

**p. 58**  
But I knew her sick from the disease that would not go, her legs bunched under the yellow sheets, the bones gone limp as worms. The yellow pillow, the yellow smell, the bottles and spoons. Her head thrown back like a thirsty lady. My aunt, the swimmer.

## Some notes about the examples:

- In example 1, the use of a chart helps students keep track of their progress and make sure to answer all parts of a complicated question (three questions about two different excerpts). It also lets the teacher do this as well and to see at a glance how far along students are and to quickly differentiate which part of the task students are struggling with (presumably because they are leaving it blank, writing less, or doing it last).

- In example 2, dividing the task into parts a, b, and c again allows the teacher to Check for Understanding on individual components and quickly assess where students are in the process from a pacing point of view, but here the use of lines reinforces the use of complete sentences versus informal notes in responding.

- In example 3, the scaffolded structure separates the different elements students should be reflecting on

---

<!-- Page 199 -->

without being too structured or leading (or asking for more writing than is needed). It also models for students how to take organized notes.

In addition to enabling you to find answers (or key steps in the work process) more quickly, *Standardize the Format* allows you to disrupt students less. You won’t spend time flipping through their work or asking them to help you find answers and this will allow them to concentrate. Most important, though, instead of expending energy (and using your own working memory) locating answers, you can identify and assess trends among your students’ work and spot examples to share with the class. Simplifying search tasks reduces extraneous cognitive load; the more consistent the appearance and placement of the data, the more you will be able to focus on what it’s telling you. You perceive more accurately, remember more of what you see, and think more productively about it.

There are some surprising relational benefits to all this *“efficiency”* and *“productivity”* and you can see an example of them in the video *Nicole Warren: Keystone*. As she circulates and observes during the last few minutes of the clip you may notice the beautiful connections she makes with students. There are sincere encouragements and acknowledgments. These little moments of relationship building are surely something most of us seek, so it’s important to observe that they stem in part from the ease with which she can find what she is looking for in each student’s work. The easiness leaves her relaxed and confident. With her working memory only lightly taxed by search costs, her mind is free to think about each student in turn as she works the room, and all her warmth and graciousness can show.

There are other ways you can continue to prioritize your focus on the content of student work by *Standardizing the*

---

<!-- Page 200 -->

*Format* even further. In addition to directing students to answer in the same space, you can also ask them to lift up the key pieces of the answer that you are looking for as you circulate. “Box the equation you used to calculate the sum,” or “Underline the appositive you added to your thesis.” These additional directions not only make it easier for you to focus on the most important aspect of student work when time is of the essence, but also heighten student awareness of the most important variable to include in their work. Boxing the remainder or circling the active verbs in their topic sentence helps students to focus and prioritize.

My team and I recently tried to use *Standardize the Format* ourselves at a workshop on CFU. The topic was “Reject Self-Report” and the activity was a series of case studies: six transcripts from classroom situations where a teacher had initially relied on student self-report to assess mastery. Teachers in the workshop were asked to rewrite cases, scripting their questions to better gather data about student mastery in lieu of self-report. Workshop participants were asked to complete several of the scenarios over the course of a few minutes. At the bottom was an additional section where people were asked to identify and rewrite a case from their own experience. The page we provided looked like *Figure 3.1*.

| **Example 2:**<br>Teacher: To glare and to gaze are similar because they both mean that you are looking at someone or something—usually for a long time.

Glare has a negative charge, whereas gaze has a positive charge. Get it?<br>Students: Yes. | |

Figure 3.1 Reject Self-Report Mini Case Studies

As my team and I circulated, we were able to ascertain the following quickly and easily:

*How quickly people were working and how many scenarios they had completed.* This allowed us to make a simple but fundamental decision: How much time should we allocate for the activity? Did people need more time?

*Which scenarios people chose to work on.* It was clear at a glance which of the scenarios they’d chosen to rewrite. Each was in its own box of about a quarter page. I could glance over twenty shoulders and know

---

<!-- Page 202 -->

which topics people had found interesting and would want to discuss during the post-activity discussion. It also helped us write scenarios for future workshops. If very few people choose example 5, for example, we could replace it.

*What good ideas and common misunderstandings we could talk about during the debrief.* It was easy for me to look for more evidence of something specific; for example, if I saw something intriguing in one participant's answer to example 3 and wanted to know if it was typical, it was ten times easier for me to track other people's responses to that example.

It was also easy to scan to the final question and differentiate those answers. That is, I wanted to look differently at the scenario of their own experience to get a quick sense of the sorts of settings they were finding applicable. This was easy to do because the answer I wanted to analyze more closely was located in the same place on every participant's paper. I could find it and tell it apart in an instant.

People worked for three or four minutes, and the room had about 120 people in it. But at the end of that time, I had a pretty good sense of what the strengths and gaps in understanding were, and it was mostly thanks to an apparently mundane design decision. Merely using *Standardize the Format* in a very simple way greatly leveraged my ability to understand what was happening in the room.

# TECHNIQUE 9: ACTIVE OBSERVATION (ACTIVEOBS)

---

<!-- Page 203 -->

Here is a simple observation about teaching: What we are looking at as our students are working is a stream of data. But this is in fact two statements at once. The first—that it is data we are looking at—tells us that it contains the seeds of insight if we think analytically and purposefully about it. The second—that it is a stream—tells us that the information may come at us fast and furious; there will often be too much to make sense of all at once, or even to remember. Happily, making a few small changes to what you do when, and before, you observe student work can help you make more sense of the data stream.

The first change is to track what you see in writing. You can see Denarius Frazier doing this in the clip *Denarius Frazier: Remainder*, which you watched at the beginning of the chapter. He is carrying a clipboard, and as he moves around the room he makes slight notations—about a consistent kind of error he's seeing or about students who can provide strong examples, or who will need extra support. Just this simple move is a game-changer.

If we think we're going to circulate around the room making “mental notes” about thirty students' work on two problems with four steps each, while perhaps taking a few questions and offering occasional encouragement, and still be able to remember at the end of it what the most common error was and which students struggled where, we are kidding ourselves. Working memory is small; even the slightest distractions cause us to forget what we're trying to remember and in an environment as complex as a classroom working memory is quickly overwhelmed. In such a setting there's really no such thing as taking mental notes.

Denarius, however, is able to give individualized feedback to each student, note their progress, and at the same time discern the common error, or the most germane topic for

---

<!-- Page 204 -->

intervention. “Much better,” he says to one student as he circulates. Think about that. He remembers how she did on a similar problem earlier in the day or perhaps the day before and tells her he can see the difference in her work. He’s able to do this because in tracking the data on student performance he engages more actively with it, and therefore remembers it. And with his observations written down, he can review his notes after one lesson or before the next. When you put your observations on paper you create a permanent record, increase the amount you remember, and free your working memory to perceive more. The result is that Denarius remembers how his student did yesterday and can affirm her progress today. Could there be a stronger statement of the fact that he believes her progress is important?

More than just writing things down, Active Observation means deciding intentionally what to look for and maintaining discipline in looking for what you have prioritized. We know from cognitive psychology that observation is subjective and unreliable; we won’t notice what’s most important unless we prepare to focus on it and are looking for it. We’re also inclined to think that looking for more things is better than attending to fewer things, but that’s often not the case in the classroom.

In one of my first teaching jobs a mentor advised me to circulate around the room when my students were doing independent work. That was good advice. Walking around and looking over this or that student’s shoulder encouraged students to do their best work, in part because my actions suggested that I cared about what they were writing and was interested in their ideas, and, frankly, that I would know how hard they were working. But there was a lot more I could have done to get the most out of that “walking around.”

---

<!-- Page 205 -->

For one thing, while I believed I was very observant, I probably was not. Usually I would be looking passively, waiting to be struck by spontaneous observations about what students were doing. This can sometimes be useful, but it meant that I was prone to inattentional blindness— not seeing what was plainly before me—for example, that students were not successfully able to do the task I’d assigned. What I noticed was often a random event. What I gave students feedback on was also likely to be accidental. If on any given day there were ten really important things you could say about students' writing, I might notice something about number seven on the list. Or number nine. The cost was that I wasn’t talking about topics one, two, and three consistently—and sometimes not at all.

And honestly, without a real purpose for what I was looking for, I sometimes allowed myself to become more passive. I really wasn’t looking that carefully. I’d mimic the actions of a carefully observing teacher, nodding approvingly and squinting as if in keen interest, but my mind would wander. I would often be looking mostly for whether my students appeared to be working hard. Their topic sentences were poor and yet I’d walk right past because their pencils were scribbling away. Effort is generally a good thing but it doesn’t guarantee learning. “Never mistake activity for achievement,” the coach and teacher John Wooden advised. Just because students are working hard at a task does not mean they are learning from it. Understanding whether students are making real progress requires more careful observation. Were they using strong active verbs as they scribbled away? Were they able to cite evidence both directly and indirectly?

Compare my well-intentioned but mostly subpar observation to the deliberateness we see in the clip Julia

---

<!-- Page 206 -->

*Addeo: Binomials.* Like Denarius, she's carrying a page of notes as she works the room. She explained what was on it.

“My ‘key’ mirrors exactly what students should have on their paper, including the question, the work that they should be showing, and the correct answer, boxed,” Julia told me. “I leave some room on the side to make checks and notes as I monitor the classroom. I keep a tally of how students did or the initials of names that I know I want to *Show Call* or *Cold Call*.”

As she observes, she quickly notes that students are doing fine with problem number 1. She won't need more than a quick review afterwards to reinforce technical vocabulary. But her observations reveal that there's something going on in problem 2. You can see her marking up her notes with details on the errors students are making. Then you can see her literally step back, review the data, and make a decision about how to proceed—as that decisive nod of her head about thirty-seven seconds in reveals.

Tracking the data in writing has freed her working memory. Rather than merely trying to remember what she's seen, it can now focus on analyzing what students are doing. Her use of *Active Observation* allows her later to *Cold Call* students who she knows will contribute strong explanations when she's reviewing the problem. These students often do an exemplary job of explaining concepts to their peers. This is not a lucky accident. She has used the knowledge gained from her *Active Observation* to choose participants intentionally and even strategically.

In *Front the Writing* (*technique 40*) and *Disciplined Discussions* (*technique 46*) I call this idea *“Hunting, Not Fishing.”* You *hunt* for productive answers that will move the conversation in a productive direction as you circulate. Then later you draw on them while teaching so you don't have to *fish*—call on students more or less randomly,

---

<!-- Page 207 -->

hoping they will have useful responses. This allows you to let students do more of the cognitive work, and build a culture where the strength of students' thinking is more visible to their peers and where being *Cold Called* is as often as not a sign of the quality of their work. “Hunting” for answers in this way and remembering whom to call on eight or twelve minutes later demands more of working memory than almost any teacher has available in a busy classroom. It requires *Active Observation*.

But *Active Observation* is not just taking notes. It's deciding what you should see and then looking carefully for whether you see it. It's thinking about what mistakes might occur and being ready to respond. Crucially, Julia's ability to observe and assess what's happening begins with the exemplar she's planned (technique 1, Exemplar Planning) and that she carries with her as she goes. To observe effectively in real time, you must think through what you'll look for in student work beforehand.

Let's focus in on how Denarius uses his exemplar in the clip *Denarius Frazier: Remainder*, which we began discussing earlier. You'll notice that he's making tiny, quick notations as he circulates, for example, in the following image.

---

<!-- Page 208 -->

Oh, check that remainder.

Uncommon Impact

Students are dividing polynomials and a student has struggled to find the remainder. But Denarius doesn't write “David: can't find remainder” or something like that. We know this because his notation is a tick mark, done in a fraction of a second, which thus allows him to keep circulating quickly with his working memory free. That might seem like a mundane observation but it tells us something profound: Denarius has made a list of likely errors and he's marking up this list each time he sees one. Not only can he now move quickly as he makes his rounds but as a trend in the data emerges he will see it in the data instantly. In fact in this clip Denarius recognizes that eight or nine students are struggling with the remainder and is able to target his reteach to exactly this issue—the one most relevant to the greatest number of students. He doesn't even need a step-back moment to analyze the data as we see Julia Addeo use; he simply glances at what is

---

<!-- Page 209 -->

essentially a histogram of mistakes that he's generated as he walks. By the time he's halfway around the room much of his working memory is focused on how he'll reteach the example. And he is able to draw an excellent example from a student for a *Show Call* because, like Julia, this is something he's made note of.

Discussing this video afterwards, Denarius noted that his seating plan is also critical to his success. The two front corners of the room are the places he always starts his observational rounds. He sets his seating plan so the first four students he observes in each of those corners present what is often a statistical sample of the room—a mix that includes at least one student who often struggles, one student who's often typical of the group, and one who is often a high performer.

> “After looking at four kids' work I often have a decent hypothesis for how the room overall is doing. I'm testing that hypothesis already as I work the first column, and by the second column I'm deciding what to do about it.”

> “A lot of people think I'm tracking who got it right and who got it wrong but I track the nature of the errors I see. When I finish my observations, knowing what they misunderstand rather than what number of kids got it right is much more useful. And that, too, helps me develop my plan to reteach as I work.”

As I'm sure you're recognizing, the design of the tool you use to track and analyze data in real time is critical. The following illustration shows some examples.

In this example the teacher has to focus on who's demonstrated proficiency, student by student. It's probably a pretty straightforward skill—punctuating a complete sentence—which is why she can give it a yes/no check. This approach wouldn't work for everything teachers assess, but the emphasis on ensuring that she checks in on every student's progress is powerful. She has also left space for

<!-- Page 211 -->

narrative notes if she needs them, which allows the tool to gather both quantitative and narrative data about the work.

Story Problem: Yedidah is making friendship bracelets for her birthday party. At the store, beads are sold in packs of thirty-five. She decides to buy six packs. When she gets home, her mother suggests using twenty beads on each of her friends' bracelets. How many complete bracelets can Yedidah make for her friends?

| Point of Error                                                                 | Number of Students Making Error |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Error 1:** Scholars incorrectly multiply $6 \times 35$                        |                                 |
| **Error 2:** Scholars incorrectly use the total of 210 beads in the final step of the problem |                                 |
| **Error 3:** Scholars create a bracelet with less than 20 beads                  |                                 |

In this example the teacher is more focused on error trends rather than individual student progress. During class she'll make a hash mark each time she sees a mistake, regardless of who made it, so she can sum things up quickly at the end of her circulation and determine what she needs to review. Again, there's room here for narrative detail. Denarius's tracker likely looks similar to the one we see above.

This exemplar also offers insight into how teachers plan when they will gather key data. Notice the difference here between Error 2 and Error 3. Clearly these are two pieces of the same math problem, but the teacher has divided the errors into two separate rounds of observation. Julia Addeo

<!-- Page 212 -->

told us something similar when we spoke to her. “I’ll always include the laps that I make. So on lap number one I’m just coming around to look at your multiplication. Or I’m just coming around to just see how you isolated the variable. I’ll include that for most essential questions on either a *Do Now* or a problem set.” In other words, she’s not looking for everything at once but imagines a series of observational rounds, each focused on a slightly different aspect of the task.

“I check every student multiple times during math block,” fourth-grade teacher Nicole Warren told me (you can see her *Active Observation* in the video *Nicole Warren: Keystone*). “I first observe for procedural norms, including marking up the problem and labeling work. Then I circulate for conceptual understanding and record which students are on track, which students have basic mathematical errors, and which students might have a deeper conceptual misunderstanding. This helps to make the plan for the discussion and also helps build accountability around student work.”

“When students know you’ll be circulating to them every couple of minutes,” Nicole Willey said, “they work quickly and efficiently. They love being rewarded by a smiley face on their paper or a high-five. [The joy students feel in Nicole’s small notes and appreciations as she observes is extremely evident in the video.] There’s also a lot of celebration around success and growth. At the end of the (class) each day, I announce which students achieved 100 percent, as well as which students improved. Students are highly invested in this moment of public recognition. We also have group goals that if, as a class, we get 100 percent on each of the questions the class gets a special prize. These incentives, while external, build a sense of community and showcase that working hard leads to long-term success.”

---

<!-- Page 213 -->

Often teachers make their observational focus transparent to students. “I'm coming around to look at your hypotheses,” they might say. At that time they'd try to give feedback only on that topic before adding additional rounds; for example, “This time I'm coming around to see whether you have described clear experimental and control groups.” This influences student actions even before they've given any feedback. Students see their teacher approaching and think about their hypothesis because they know she will be looking for it. Perhaps they focus on it more in the first place. Teachers influence students to focus on key tasks when they tell them that they are looking for them.

You can see evidence of these actions in Rafael Good's tracking sheet from his math class. He's worked the problem himself so he can use his own model to see gaps in student thinking more quickly, made notes on delivery moves (*Show Call* exemplary work!), and notes the time allocated for the work (“4 mins”) so he doesn't lose track. He's written out the initial phrase he wants to say when he sends students off to work (“Make sure to show multiplication steps”) and finally his Lap 1 focus (“L1”). He's written out the exact phrase he wants to use before he starts observing—“Checking for your multiplication steps to be written out.”

Focusing on limited and specific priority elements when you give feedback makes it easier to give immediate feedback to every student and, perhaps unexpectedly, this is often helpful in building relationships. The most important and genuine tool for relationship building is something you might call relational teaching—using the way you teach the content to build trust. Trust comes when your teaching demonstrates your skill as a teacher and your interest in and ability to help students learn. Giving effective and precise feedback communicates to each student:  

- Your success is important to me. I am aware of your progress in this endeavor.  
- I will help you succeed.  
- I believe you will succeed.  

That is more important in the long run to building trust with students than whether you chat with them in the hallways or ask them about what shows they like to watch. And it ensures that the relationships we build are about learning and the topics we study.

---

<!-- Page 215 -->

In *Culturally Responsive Education in the Classroom*, Adeyemi Stembridge writes, “Depth of learning requires that students enter into a meaningful relationship with the content itself. ... This is most often profoundly facilitated through modeling of a relationship with content by teachers.” Relationships are valuable because they are “the channel through which investment in school is personalized.”

The quality of feedback enabled by *ActiveObs*, effective, focused, informed by an understanding of each student's learning, brings the interconnection between student, teacher, and content to life. Consider the dynamic between students and teachers in the video *Active Observation Montage*. The three clips are a case study in relationship building. In the first classroom, we see Nicole Warren giving feedback on a math problem. “Super smart,” she says, “going and checking every answer choice while you have extra time... . Really nice.” The smile on the student's face lights up the screen. Though Denarius Frazier's style is a bit more muted, he too pauses at every student, commenting not just on their work in the moment. “Killing it,” he says, as he delivers a fist bump and a smile. His “much better” shows that he knows where his students struggle and therefore is able to celebrate growth. Tamesha McGuire's first-graders get the same mix of affirmation—“Nice work, my love!”—and meaningful, targeted feedback.

I should note that people sometimes confuse *Active Observation* with “aggressive monitoring,” which is a term Paul Bambrick-Santoyo has coined to describe giving feedback to every student using a monitoring key over a series of specific rounds or laps. Much of the guidance I've provided here reflects Paul's insights and the implementation of teachers trained by him, so I hope it's clear that I see immense value in that approach. Teachers

should use it! But it's also important to recognize the value in balancing it with a broader array of data-gathering approaches. Using *Active Observation* therefore includes also using alternative approaches to giving every student immediate feedback as you observe because alternative observational tools can create balance and emphasize different aspects of the learning process. The following chart provides three options for *Active Observation*:

| **Option 1** | **Option 2** | **Option 3** |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Sometimes called "Aggressive Monitoring." Teacher tracks progress of and gives immediate feedback to each individual student. | Teacher gives feedback to the group after tracking and completing observations (and does not provide individual feedback during observing). | Teacher gives feedback (and makes observations) focused on specific individuals (and not the whole group). |

Though Option 1 is often excellent, one limitation—and therefore one reason to occasionally balance it with other approaches—is that the need to get to every student can lead to rushed feedback or a tone that feels hurried or transactional—it feels like the teacher's goal is to get around the room.7 This can crowd out time for questions, for example. There may be times when you ask students to hold their questions—the data could be more important—but there will also be times when it's valuable to respond and linger. Sometimes it's valuable to give feedback right away but sometimes it's appropriate to let students struggle for a bit and not receive immediate feedback on their progress.

It's worth considering that Option 1 could be adapted. You could, for example, still try to observe and gather data from every student's work but *not* try to give live feedback as

---

<!-- Page 217 -->

you circulate, giving feedback only to the group at the end of your lap. This would allow you to make independent work feel more autonomous for students. Careful observation accompanied by silence can be powerful, especially if your feedback to the group makes it clear you were observing carefully. Perhaps you want students to struggle a bit or not know right away whether they are on the right track. Not attempting to give feedback as you circulate could also allow you more time and working memory to observe trends and issues in student work. On the other hand, you might risk allowing individual errors to persist and/or students not feeling the same level of support and/or accountability, so it is important for you to choose intentionally, based both on the objective for the day and the moment in the lesson, as well as what you see as you observe.

You can see a strong example of the quieter approach to ActiveObs in the clip BreOnna Tindall: ActiveObs cut from her seventh-grade ELA classroom. As the clip opens, students are reading and annotating a short nonfiction text about the concept of “blind justice.” This is part of their larger reading of the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass. BreOnna, clipboard in hand, is circulating and reading over students' shoulders, occasionally nodding appreciatively as she comes across ideas that will be useful in the discussion. “I'm treasure hunting,” is how BreOnna described it. “I'm looking for the pieces of the conversation that I'm going to highlight so we can come to those key understandings in the lesson.”

Her route around the classroom seems planned but not rushed, and she doesn't pause to read every student paper. Most students do not get feedback. Her goal is to inform the coming conversation. So she's still taking notes and she still occasionally asks clarifying questions (“What's this underline mean here?”), but mostly they are intended to

---

<!-- Page 218 -->

ensure that she understands what students are thinking, rather than to give them guidance. She's noting ideas rather than addressing misconceptions. When she writes on her clipboard, she's not tracking every student's accuracy, but rather taking notes on the trends she's seeing and highlighting students she might choose to call on later in discussion. In the subsequent discussion, you can see the results of BreOnna's ActiveObs. It's a great example of “hunting, not fishing.” BreOnna calls on Adriel, whose answer she knows is a good starting point, then Renee, who she knows has used the word “exonerates.”

“I try not to go for the kid who has the all-the-way right answer first,” BreOnna said. “I try to find people who have pieces of the right answer. As opposed to saying ‘build’ arbitrarily, I try to find people who have pieces of the right answer so they can really understand how a discussion works—what does it really mean to build?”

BreOnna's observation allows her to honor student voice but still curate the conversation for focus and quality, and, she noted, it allows her to ensure that students hear a high-quality response without having to provide it herself. “I don't always want to be the person stamping the right answer—that's boring! Also, that takes away the kids' belief that they know,” BreOnna said. “I try to find other kids in the classroom to unearth the key point.”

## ActiveObs in the Early Grades

You can see another example of a quieter form of *ActiveObs* in the video *Narlene Pacheco: ActiveObs*. She's done a great job of *Standardizing the Format* in her kindergarten classroom at Immaculate Conception School in the Bronx. Everyone's workspace is set up the same—clean and tidy. It's easy for her to see what she's looking for at a glance. She circulates around the room carefully but doesn't give feedback to every student. Instead, she's looking for overall trends, and she shares a reminder about that (make sure you're going from left to right) to the whole class. She's already adapting her teaching to the data. Perhaps because what she's looking for—and the range of possible errors—is smaller, she's not using a clipboard. But she uses a hint of *Affirmative Checking*—“Hands on your head when you are ready.” Students can signal when they are ready to be checked. This lets her know where to look first. She spots Clara struggling and uses **Break It Down** ([technique 37]) beautifully for her, prompting her to find the error for herself. This is successful in part because Ms. Pacheco shows such patience and emotional constancy. But it's also worth noting that she has lots of time to spend with Clara, in part because she's not trying to give feedback to every student. On the second round of observation—for the word “yet”—you can see that she's deliberately checking back on Clara to see how she does. Clara's got it, now. She smiles and Ms. Pacheco is sure to reinforce her success.

To return to Adeyemi Stembridge's observations about the nature of relationships, the responsibility of being a teacher lies in building students' relationships with

learning and content. Their relationships with us are the means to achieve that goal. The strongest and most productive teacher relationships are built by establishing a triangle in which we connect to students and (help to) connect them to content.

Students

RELATIONSHIPS

Teacher Content

We are conduits, in other words. If students do not develop a valuable relationship to the things they study in school, their relationship with their teacher will not have accomplished its full purpose. This challenges us to resist the desire to be the center of the story; the goal is not to be loved and remembered forever but for students to take away a belief in their own capacity, to value the process of learning, and just possibly love or at least appreciate deeply the ideas of science, math, music, or literature. ActiveObs is a primary tool teachers can use to help relationships serve this purpose.

# TECHNIQUE 10: SHOW ME

Another useful tool in making effective and efficient observations of student work involves flipping the dynamic in which a teacher works to gather data about a group of students whose role in this process is largely passive. Instead, in *Show Me*, students actively present the teacher with visual evidence of their understanding. This gives teachers a way to quickly assess an entire class's understanding, more or less at a glance, and has the added benefit of often being enjoyable to students.

*Show Me* could mean students presenting answers on mini-whiteboards, as you'll see in the video *Dani Quinn: Show Me* (which we'll study more in a moment) or holding up a number of fingers, each representing the answer to a multiple-choice problem on cue, as Brian Belanger/Denarius Frazier do in the video *Belanger/Frazier: Show Me Montage*. They've cut out the need to circulate around the room to gather data but still are able to get a strong sense for where everyone in the class stands.

Here are the basic criteria for a good *Show Me*. It should ask students to (1) *present objective data*, (2) usually *in unison*, and (3) *in a format that the teacher can assess at a glance*. It's worth taking a moment to go a bit deeper into each of these criteria.

*Present objective data:* When Denarius and Brian ask students to respond by showing on their fingers which answer they chose, they are presenting their actual answer, not their (subjective) opinion about their own understanding. Self-report, as we discussed earlier, is notoriously unreliable. So versions of *Show Me* that take subjective self-report data and make it visible (e.g. “Tell me if you understand: Thumbs up, thumbs down, thumbs

---

<!-- Page 222 -->

sideways”) don't help much. You want to see their actual answer. “Hold up one finger if you chose answer A, two if you chose answer B,” and so forth is a better approach.

## In unison:

In most cases asking students to share their answers visually works best when it happens in unison, for efficiency reasons and to preserve the integrity of the data. Imagine you're a student. You choose answer B, but for whatever reasons don't share your answer right away when the teacher asks the class to hold up their answer. Glancing around the room, you see eighteen classmates showing they chose answer C. If you reveal that you answered B, you will likely be the only one. Will you change your answer? Studies have repeatedly shown that people are deeply swayed by the answers of their peers. In a classic study by Solomon Asch, for example, experimental subjects were placed in a group of “participants,” who were in fact confederates of the experimenters. The group was asked to compare the lengths of a series of lines that were clearly of different lengths. Without confederates present, subjects reported the length of the lines incorrectly less than 1 percent of the time, but in a setting where confederates consistently reported believing the lines were the same length, most people made efforts to conform, giving an answer they knew to be wrong at least some of the time. A third of participants changed any given answer on average and 75 percent of participants changed an answer at least once over twelve trials. Conclusion: Most people will change their answers to something they don't believe is right in order to conform. If everyone presents their data point simultaneously and on cue, it prevents students from changing their answer based on their peers’ responses. Ensuring that answers are given in unison also maximizes pacing and flow. Show Me can often feel energetic and game-like to students, and their crisp and coordinated participation facilitates the sense of momentum it creates.

---

<!-- Page 223 -->

In a format that the teacher can assess at a glance. The data in *Show Me* are actively presented by students in visual form—held up so you can see and scan them quickly from where you're standing; limited circulation required. The clearer you are about what the presentation of the data should look like, the better. You'll want to decide and explain to students whether they should hold their fingers up in the air (so you can see them easily) or in front of their chests (so they are less visible to peers), for example. If they're writing on a whiteboard, are the answers boxed? How high must the whiteboards be held? This is important because the less of your working memory you have to use in searching, the more you can spend analyzing the data.

There are two common versions of *Show Me*: the first is *hand signals*, and the second is *slates*.

## Hand Signals

Although there are a variety of ways to employ hand signals, the key to the approach is that on a specific cue, students hold up digits in unison to represent their answer.

In *Belanger/Frazier: Show Me Montage*, Bryan Belanger uses hand signals to gauge student mastery of a multiple-choice question about rates of change. Within seconds of the morning greeting, Bryan prompts students with the cue “rock, paper, scissors … one, two!” On “two,” students pound their desks three times in unison before they raise their hands to reveal their response (one finger for answer choice A, two for B, and so on). Bryan has made the act of showing him their answers so familiar that this routine goes like clockwork.

Once students' hands are up, Bryan scans the room, narrating what he's looking for (“making sure they're nice and high”) as well as what he sees (“I see lots of twos, a couple of fours”). This reinforces the procedural

---

<!-- Page 224 -->

expectations and reminds students that he's *observing carefully*. He then asks students to be ready to defend their answer. In doing so, he acknowledges that multiple responses have been given but, crucially, he has withheld the answer (see [technique 12](#), *Culture of Error*) and not yet told them which one is correct.

Instead of revealing the answer himself, Bryan calls on Blaize (who correctly selected B) to explain his answer and reasoning. He affirms Blaize's answer but also calls on Elizabeth (who incorrectly chose D) to reiterate it. Bryan then asks students to “check or change” their work for that problem, saying, “Give yourself a check if you picked answer choice B. If you did not, circle that, and fix it now.” By insisting that students *Own and Track* ([technique 14](#)), he ensures that they all internalize the answer and the reasoning behind it.

While the multiple-choice format of Bryan's question lends itself well to *Show Me*, it's also possible to use hand signals to gather data on questions that were not originally designed as multiple choice, as Denarius Frazier shows in the same video. Denarius has written out on chart paper two solutions for a problem that students have been working on independently. He asks students to evaluate the two solutions and then says, “Let's take a poll. We'll reveal on one. One finger if you agree with solution A, two for B. Where are we, in three, two, and one?” Notice how careful he is to ensure that answers are revealed in unison. Thus he is able to instantly read the room and see that students are divided between the two solutions. He sends them into a *Turn and Talk* ([technique 43](#)) to discuss their thinking. Afterwards, Denarius takes another poll to see if their thinking has shifted as a result. He scans the room to assess the new data, and begins the discussion with a student who chose B. Other students share their thinking, and then Denarius shifts focus and asks someone who

---

<!-- Page 225 -->

choose A to explain. Note that he is withholding the answer and managing his tell (see *Culture of Error*)—students still don't know which is the right answer. Finally, after a student comfortably and confidently changes her answer, Denarius confirms that A was correct. His use of *Show Me* has allowed him to efficiently poll the room multiple times, note trends in data, and determine which students he should call on when.

In the video *Lisa Wing: Boom, Boom, Pow*, you can see Lisa using hand signals with her seventh graders. She's asked them to evaluate three anonymous thesis paragraphs written by class members. She reinforces the fun and engaging procedure (*boom, boom, pow*) and gets really crisp, timely follow-through. She then follows up with questioning, asking students to discuss their opinions. It's a nice example and suggests how you could even ask students to use hand signals to respond to a question for which answers were a matter of opinion. By the way, it's also a great clip because there's so much “reality of the classroom” baked in. Not only do we get to see Lisa's gracious response when she calls on a student who's lost his voice, but there's a story playing out between the two girls in the front row at the beginning of the clip. One girl is proudly telling her friend that one of the paragraphs chosen as an example is hers! It's a lovely scene that reminds us how meaningful it is for students to see their work valued, but it should also remind us how easy it is for students to influence the answers other students give if the procedure for hand signals isn't crisp. The student could just as easily be “helping” her classmate by telling her, “Pick #2.”

## Slates

Slates is another form of *Show Me* in which students complete their work at their desk and then, on a signal,

---

<!-- Page 226 -->

hold it up to show their teacher. Often teachers use small erasable whiteboards to do this, as Dani Quinn's students do in the video *Dani Quinn: Show Me*, shot at London's Michaela Community School. Notice Dani's consistent upbeat cue for students to show their work (“Hold up!”) and the way she makes reviewing the boards easier by going row by row and asking students whose work she's reviewed to put their boards down. She offers individual feedback to students as she scans, building a *Culture of Error* by keeping her tone similar whether students got it wrong—“Sam, what's five times five?”—or right—“Bianca, very good.” The impressive number of names she's able to use lets many students feel seen and acknowledged, and we see her reinforce the procedure when she asks for “Boards down” and a faster response.8 Finally, Dani does an excellent job of not just gathering data but adapting instruction to that data: “A few mistakes. We'll do one more …”

Slates needn't be done only with whiteboards—you might have students hold up their work in other ways: sketch a line on graph paper; write a sentence defining *verisimilitude*, perhaps “double spaced” so you can read it a bit easier from afar; add a margin note on page 26. Although scanning the responses might not be quite as simple in those cases, the approach can still be revealing (and effective in supporting accountability).

## TECHNIQUE 11: AFFIRMATIVE CHECKING

A final tool that can help you use observation to check for understanding, *Affirmative Checking*, involves the strategic use of checkpoints where students must get confirmation that their work is correct or on target, and that they are

---

<!-- Page 227 -->

ready to move on to the next stage—a new paragraph, a second draft, a harder set of problems, the last step in a lab. In many cases students determine their own timing for doing so, which can create opportunities for self-assessment.

You can see Hilary Lewis using the technique in her first-grade classroom in the video *Hilary Lewis: Green Post-It*. This clip appeared in previous versions of the book and is one of our longest-serving clips at workshops; we continue to use it because Hilary does such a beautiful job of gauging student mastery before independent work. She's warm, attentive, and exudes high expectations. She asks students sitting on the carpet to complete a math problem on a green sticky note, which she calls a “ticket.” Students must show that ticket to her as proof that they're ready to start independent practice (IP) at their desks. She stokes their interest in a perfect first-grade way by comparing this to the experience of “going into a movie.” By requiring students to “earn” the opportunity, she turns IP into a kind of reward.

When the first student comes to have her work checked, it looks for a moment like a race is on to get in line first. Students start to scramble to show Ms. Lewis their work, but Hilary checks that trend in a loving voice: “Scholars, the only way you can come up here is if I ask you to come.”

One by one, students complete the problem and await Hilary's signoff. She calls them up, first individually and then row by row. For correct work, she responds, “Go get started” in a warm, quiet way. Not unexpectedly a few students have done the problem incorrectly—or perhaps hastily—to which Hilary responds: “Please go back and check your work.” Her reaction is emotionally constant. When one student shows her work for the wrong problem, Hilary uses the same warm, supportive tone: “OK. You did

---

<!-- Page 228 -->

your own problem, which is great. I need you to do *that* problem” [as she points to the board].

Having everyone complete a gatekeeper problem before they move on to the full problem set lets Hilary correct small misunderstandings and reinforce working carefully and it helps students see that they are “ready” for a larger task, when they work carefully and attentively.

You can see a useful adaptation of this idea with older students in the clip *Jessica Madio: Silent Hand When You Have It*. Flipping the idea of an *Exit Ticket*, which her seventh-graders at St. Athanasius School in New York City are familiar with, Jessica uses an entrance pass prior to a section of independent practice. Getting it right shows you're ready to work on your own successfully.9

Jessica has *Standardized the Format* so answers are easy for her to find and assess quickly, and she tells students to raise “a silent hand when you have it. I'll come around and I'll check it.” Instead of checking students based on seating plan, Jessica has given students agency over when their work will be checked. They are familiar with this routine and jump into the problem on cue. As each student finishes and raises a hand, Jessica simply says, “Thank you,” and checks off the problem if it's correct. Students then transition immediately to independent practice problems without additional directions. Of course Jessica is also using *Active Observation* and taking notes on which students struggle and why. She uses this data to call a handful of students to work at the back table with her. These students have all made a similar mistake, and so they get additional support while others work independently. When they appear to be able to solve on their own, she sends them back to practice independently. Jessica offers a great reminder that classroom differentiation starts with data gathering.

<!-- Page 229 -->

One of the nice things about *Affirmative Checking* is the avenues to self-assessment it can create. *Affirmative Checking* offers students an opportunity to gauge their own work and decide when they are ready for the teacher to evaluate what they've done. This empowers students to assess their own work first—*Am I done? Do I feel ready for the next step?*—before asking for a response from the teacher. Because students elect the moment they'd like feedback, *Affirmative Checking* gives us additional data on student thinking about their own work that we might not see when we're reading over students' shoulders (“Oh, I see—you thought this was finished, but let's think about ...”). Like *Stretch It* ([technique 17]()), it can contribute to a culture in which correct answers are rewarded with future challenge—for example, “Great, now you're ready to move onto some advanced problems.” That sense of accomplishment from seeing themselves pass through checkpoints successfully also help students develop confidence. Their progress is made more legible to them.

One of the keys to using *Affirmative Checking* effectively, however, is minimizing or eliminating the time students spend waiting for evaluation. The time students spend with a hand in the air, waiting for a teacher to come around (or even less productively, arms folded, pencil down, chatting with a neighbor) is a waste of precious instructional time and a risk that students will lose both their momentum and train of thought. The following tips for designing effective *Affirmative Checking* will help you balance student independence with efficiency.

Consider whether the content of your lesson is conducive to staged checking. The checkpoint(s) should ideally pass quickly—recall how efficient Hilary is when she reads each sticky note. If student work requires lengthy analysis or detailed feedback, it may not be feasible to ask everyone to wait for the next step while you read and respond.

---

<!-- Page 230 -->

Have a rubric or an answer sheet ready even if the work appears pretty straightforward. *This will free working memory and speed your ability to process.*

Consider how long each student might need to complete the task. Work would ideally be challenging or complex enough that students would tend to finish at different times, spreading out the checking required of the teacher so there was less waiting. *Affirmative Checking* might work well in writing classes, for example, where students typically complete drafts at very different paces, staggering the checkpoints from the teacher's perspective; however, it would be important to keep the check focused. You won't be able to read each student's first draft but you could ask students to circle five dynamic verbs or two indirect quotations or their thesis paragraph.

It can be helpful to add optional work. If you gave students three problems in one stage of a problem set but made the third a bonus question (or extra credit, perhaps), you could start checking students who had completed one or two. If students finished simultaneously and had to wait, they could go on to the third problem while you checked others' work. This might sound contradictory—isn't the point here to check before you go on? The difference is that the third problem would be at the same level of difficulty as the first two, so it would create an extra buffer of (productive) time in which you could complete your checking.

You may also consider making the signal for “I’m ready” the sort of cue that students can give while continuing to work. Keeping his or her hand in the air for three minutes makes it all but impossible for the student to go on to another problem. But an index card that’s green on one side and yellow on the other, for example, can be flipped to show “I’m ready to be checked” while continuing to work on the bonus problem.

---

<!-- Page 231 -->

Another way to increase efficiency is by combining *Affirmative Checking* with *Show Me*, having students hold up their work for you to sign off on. You can see this in the video *Jon Bogard: Go to IP*, in which Jon uses whiteboards to dispatch some students to independent practice and to require more guided practice of others.

## Student-Driven Affirmative Checking

Another approach to *Affirmative Checking* is to allow your students to own more of the process of checking for accuracy and then present the data to you. Students could self-check on a key you provide and report their results. Or they could be responsible for checking one another's work in partners and then report the results to you, which would reduce the number of checks you needed to make. This works best when it relies on objective rather than subjective assessments.

One important fact to consider if you have students participate in *Affirmative Checking* is that there are two key purposes to the technique. One is to make sure that students are successful before going on to more complex work; the other is for you to gather data on how your students are doing. Distributing the checking accomplishes the first with more efficiency, but risks reducing your access to the data: If students self-check, will you know how they did? I'm sure you will find a way to balance these goals—either by using student-centered checking sometimes and checking yourself other times, or by engineering ways to track the data during student-centered checking (or both). For example, if students self-checked against a rubric, they could check a box to show how they did so that you could track it later. It's just important to be aware of the challenge and the possible trade-off as you're out there adapting and designing new and better solutions.

# TECHNIQUE 12: CULTURE OF ERROR

In a recent article about his development as a musician, the pianist Jeremy Denk observed a hidden challenge of teaching and learning: “While the teacher is trying to … discover what is working, the student is in some ways trying to elude discovery, disguising weaknesses in order to seem better than she is.”10

His observation is a reminder: If the goal of *Checking for Understanding* is to bridge the gap between *I taught it* and *they learned it*, that goal is far easier to accomplish if students *want* us to find the gap, if they are willing to share information about errors and misunderstandings—and far harder if they seek to prevent us from discovering them.

Left to their natural inclinations, learners will often lean toward the latter. Out of pride or anxiety, sometimes out of appreciation for us as teachers—they don’t want us to feel like we haven’t served them well—students will often seek to “elude discovery” unless we build cultures that socialize them to think differently about mistakes. A classroom that has such a culture has what I call a *Culture of Error*.

Those teachers who are most able to diagnose and address errors quickly make *Check for Understanding (CFU)* a shared endeavor between themselves and their students. From the moment students arrive, they work to shape their perception of what it means to make a mistake, pushing them to think of “wrong” as a first, positive, and often critical step toward getting it “right,” socializing them to acknowledge and share mistakes without defensiveness, with interest or fascination even, or possibly relief—help is on the way!

The term “psychological safety” is often used to describe a setting in which participants are risk-tolerant. Certainly psychological safety is a critical part of a classroom with a

---

<!-- Page 233 -->

*Culture of Error*, but I would argue that the latter term goes farther: it includes both psychological safety—feelings of mutual trust and respect and comfort in taking intellectual risks—and appreciation, perhaps even enjoyment, for the insight that studying mistakes can reveal. In a classroom with a *Culture of Error*, students feel safe if they make a mistake, there is a notable lack of defensiveness, and they find the study of what went wrong interesting and valuable.

You can see this happening in the video *Denarius Frazier: Remainder. Gathering data through Active Observation* (*technique 9*), he spots a consistent error. As students seek to divide polynomials they struggle to find the remainder. Fagan is one of many students who have made the mistake. Denarius takes her paper and projects it to the class so they can study it. His treatment of this moment is critical. There is immense value in studying mistakes like this if teachers can make it feel psychologically safe. Unfortunately, it doesn't take a lot of imagination to picture the moment going wrong—badly wrong. The student could feel hurt, offended, or chastened. Her classmates could snicker. Perhaps you are imagining the phone call that evening: *Let me see if I have this right, Mr. Frazier. You projected my daughter's mistakes on the overhead for everyone to see?*

But in Denarius's hands, the moment proceeds beautifully and, more importantly, as if it were the most normal thing in the world to acknowledge a mistake and study it. How does he do it?

First, notice his tone. Denarius is emotionally constant. He is calm and steady. There's no suggestion of blame. He sounds no different whether he is talking about success or struggle. Next, he uses group-oriented language to make it clear that the issue they'll study is common among the

---

<!-- Page 234 -->

class. “On a few of *our* papers, I'm noticing that *we're* getting an incorrect remainder ...” he says. The mistake is ours; it's relevant to and reflective of the group, not just the individual. There's no feeling that Fagan has been singled out.

Another important characteristic of classrooms like Denarius’s has to do with how error itself is dealt with. It is best captured in a phrase math teacher Bob Zimmerli uses in the video *Culture of Error Montage*: “I'm so glad I saw that mistake,” he tells his students. “It's going to help me to help you.” His phrase suggests that the error is a good thing. He calls the class to attention to show it is a worthy and serious topic, but he simultaneously normalizes the error through tone and word choice.

This is different from—the opposite of in many ways—pretending it is not really an error. Notice that Bob explicitly identifies the mistake as a mistake. His goal is to make it feel normal and natural, not to minimize the degree to which students felt they had erred. I mention this because sometimes teachers struggle with this distinction. In workshops we occasionally ask teachers to write phrases that they could use to express to students the idea that it is normal and useful to be wrong. They sometimes suggest responses like “Well, that's one way you could do it,” or “Let's talk about some other ways,” or “OK, maybe. Good thinking!”

These phrases blur the line between correct and incorrect or avoid telling students they are wrong. There are, of course, times when it's useful to say, “Well, there's no right answer, but let's consider other options.” But that is a very different moment from the one in which a teacher should say something like “I can see why you'd think that but you're wrong, and the reasons why are really interesting,”

---

<!-- Page 235 -->

or “A lot of people make that mistake because it seems so logical, but let's take look at why it's wrong.”

You can see another example of this in the *Culture of Error Montage*. Mathew Gray, like Denarius, is sharing a mistake —this one made by a student named Elias (a Show Call, technique 13). He notes this right away: “Elias has made a mistake,” but he notes that this is not a surprise because he made the question difficult and that others have made the mistake as well. Then crucially he adds, “It's a mistake that I made when I first read the poem.” He is the teacher and he, too, has struggled to understand. What could more fully contradict the idea that being an expert somehow means that one does not make mistakes? The idea is not to forestall defensiveness by making students believe they are correct, in other words, but to forestall defensiveness by helping students to see that the experience of making a mistake is normal and valuable.

Here are some other phrases that do that:

- “I'm glad I saw that mistake. It teaches us something we have to fix before we've mastered this.”
- “I like that your first instinct was to use geometry, but in this situation, we have to solve algebraically.”
- “Yes, the writing here makes it very challenging to follow who is saying what. But that phrase is spoken by Mary and not by John. Let's take a look at how we know that.”
- “What I am asking you to do is difficult. Even working scientists struggle with it. But I know we'll get it, so let's take a look at what went wrong here... .”

It's worth noting that the statements are different. The first flips student expectation; the teacher is glad to have seen the mistake. The second gives credit to the student's

---

<!-- Page 236 -->

understanding of the mathematical principles—but makes it clear that she's come up with the right answer for a different setting. The third and fourth acknowledge that the task is not the sort of thing you try just once and get right. They normalize struggle.

As this *Culture of Error* is created, students become more likely to *want* to expose their mistakes. This shift from defensiveness or denial to openness is critical. As a teacher you can now spend less time and energy hunting for mistakes and more time learning from them. Similarly, if the goal is for students to learn to self-correct—to find and address errors on their own—becoming comfortable acknowledging mistakes is a critical step forward.

## Building a Culture of Error

A teacher alone cannot establish a culture in which it is safe to struggle and fail. If snickers greet a classmate who gets an answer wrong, for example, or if impatient hands wave in the air while another student is trying to answer, very little that a teacher does will result in students feeling safe exposing their mistakes to the group.

Shaping how students respond to one another's struggles is, therefore, a must. It is a process that starts with teaching students the right way to handle common situations. That is, explain how you expect them to act when someone struggles *before it happens*, share the rationale, practice the expected behaviors in hypothetical situations, and if (when) a breach occurs, reset the culture firmly, but with understanding. You might say something like, “Just a minute. I want to be very clear that we always support each other and help one another in this classroom. And we never, ever undertake actions that tear down another person. It's difficult but I will expect that of all of

---

<!-- Page 237 -->

you. Among other things, we know that person could just as well be us.”

When you think about making it safe to struggle, it's important to consider that the goal is not just eliminating potentially negative behaviors among students. Even better would be fostering a culture where students actively support one another as they struggle through the learning process. Collegiate Academies in New Orleans does a great job of encouraging this culture. When someone is struggling to answer a question, peers (or teachers) “send magic,” making a subtle hand gesture that means, “I’m supporting you.” After an answer, if peers wish to show appreciation (they often do), they show it with snapping fingers, thus creating a system for positive student-to-student feedback for quality work.11 This positive culture is one of the most remarkable and powerful things about a remarkable group of schools.

And of course having strong *Habits of Attention* ([technique 48](#)) is critical to ensure that signals of belonging are strong and the importance of each student's ideas is regularly reinforced.

That said, building a classroom culture that respects, normalizes, and values error is complex work, so I've named and described some of the key culture building moves in greater detail so they're easier to use intentionally in your classroom.

# Expect Error

After a mistake occurs, strive to show that you are glad to know about it. We want the overall message to be that errors are a normal part of learning—a positive part, often—and are most useful when they are out in the open.

---

<!-- Page 238 -->

Consider how Roxbury Prep math teacher Jason Armstrong communicated the normalcy of error even before he started reviewing answers to a problem recently. “I suspect there's going to be some disagreement here, so I might hear a couple different people's answers,” he said, before taking *four* different answers from the class. His words implied that the normal state of affairs is to see different answers among smart people doing challenging work. This also serves to teach that math is not just a matter of deciding between a right answer and a wrong one but, sometimes, a matter of deciding among a wide array of plausible answers. If the questions are hard, Jason's teaching intimated, of course people will disagree.

## Withhold the Answer

In the video *Culture of Error Montage* you can see Jason introduce a second problem from the same lesson. His choice of language was again striking:

> OK, now for the four answers we have here, A, B, C, and D, I don't want to start by asking which one you think is right, because I want to focus on the explanations that we have. So let me hear what people think of D. I don't care if you think it's right or wrong; I just want to hear what people think. Eddie, what did you say about it?

You've probably noticed that Jason's language emphasizes the importance of mathematical thinking (as opposed to just getting it right). That's valuable. In situations when many teachers say things like, “I want to focus on the explanation. How you think about this is as important as whether you got it right,” what Jason does is different because *students don't know whether or not they are discussing a right answer*. He has asked them not to

discuss how they got the answer *they* gave—and therefore think is right—but an answer that he chose.

We often begin reviewing a problem by revealing the right answer and then, suspense alleviated, talking about it. However, as soon as students know the right answer, the nature of their engagement tends to change. They shift to thinking about whether they got it right and how well they did. No matter how much they love the math for the math's sake (or history or science or literature for its sake), part of them is thinking “Yes! I got it,” or “Darn, I knew that,” or “Darn, why do I keep messing up?” If Jason had said, “The answer here is B, but I want to look at D,” some students would almost assuredly have thought, “Cool, I knew that,” *and then stopped listening as closely because in their minds they had gotten it right and didn't need to listen.*

One of the simplest and easiest things you can do to begin building a *Culture of Error* is to delay revealing whether an answer is right or wrong until after you've discussed it, and perhaps an alternative.

You can see Katie Bellucci do this in the video *Katie Bellucci: Different Answers*. She begins by asking students to use hand signals (see *technique 10*, *Show Me*) to reveal their answers to a multiple-choice question. “We have some different answers out here,” she says, “I see some twos, threes, and fours. B, C, and D.” Her tone is cheery, indicating that disagreement—and therefore wrong answers—is not a bad thing. It only proves the discussion will be interesting. But notice what she does next. As she begins reworking the problem with the help of her students, she does not tell them which of those answer choices was correct.

By *withholding the answer* until after she's discussed the question fully, Katie retains a bit of suspense, keeps students productively engaged, and avoids the distraction

of “Did I get it right?” for a few seconds. This can be very productive, not just as an intellectual exercise, but as a cultural one, in causing students to spend less energy evaluating their work and more energy thinking about the underlying ideas (“I hadn’t thought of doing it that way. I wonder if she’ll get the answer I got”).

Her lovely move to normalize and celebrate error—“Put your hand up if you changed your answer. Yes, be proud! You figured it out,” is a perfect way to express the core of the idea in *Culture of Error*—*the fun is in the process*. She celebrates struggle in the most compelling way, but that moment is really only possible if everyone is invested in “figuring it out” with her throughout the process, and it all starts with her decision to withhold the answer.

# Manage the Tell

In poker circles, players have to watch their “tell”—the unintentional signals they give that reveal the status of their hand to savvy opponents. A good player can figure out that an opponent's habit of rubbing his eyes or rechecking his cards is a nervous tic revealing a poor hand. Having a tell puts you at such a disadvantage that some elite players wear sunglasses and hooded sweatshirts to ensure they don't reveal too much.

As teachers, we also have tells—unintentional cues that reveal our hand, such as whether an answer was right or wrong or whether we valued what a student said. A tell causes us to communicate more than we realize. It compromises our ability to withhold the answer. And it can often result in our unwittingly communicating disdain for errors.

One of my tells as a teacher was the word “Interesting,” offered in a benign but slightly patronizing tone of voice and usually with a “Hmmm” in front of it and a single, long

blink of both eyes. I would use it, without realizing it, in my English classes when a student offered an interpretation I thought was flimsy. I know this was my tell because one day after a student comment, I said, “Hmmm. Interesting.” At that point, a student named Danielle said quite clearly from the back of the classroom, “Uh oh. Try again!” She knew what “interesting” meant: “Well, that was disappointing.” Like most teachers, I was saying a lot more than I thought I was. My message really was, “You probably should have kept that thought to yourself,” and the student who'd spoken and all my students knew that. So much for making it safe to be wrong.

Compare that to Emily Badillo's response to student errors in the video *Emily Badillo: Culture of Error*. Her facial expression does not change whether students are right or wrong. She's the same steady, emotionally constant self. It helps that she withholds the answer. There's no giveaway at all.

We all have tells—several, probably—and because they are unintentional, we may send them over and over, communicating a message to students that undercuts what we might intend to say. One of my most capable colleagues describes a different tell. When students gave an answer in her class, she would write it on the board if it were correct, but wouldn't bother to write it if it were wrong. Sometimes she would call on a student and turn to the board, marker poised as if to write, only to turn back to the class upon hearing the answer, and recap the marker: **Click**. Message received.

Students figure out our tells surprisingly quickly, so it's important to seek them out in our own teaching and manage them. Of course, we'll never be perfect. Of course, it's fine to say, “Interesting” or even to explicitly say, “I think we can do better” or “No, I'm sorry, that's not

---

<!-- Page 242 -->

correct.” You just want to be aware of and intentional about what you communicate and when. Think for a moment about what might be the most common teacher tell: “Does anyone have a *different* answer?” (When was the last time you said *that* when someone got it right?) In using this phrase without intentionality, you would first communicate that the answer was wrong and therefore risk discouraging students from thinking as deeply about it as they would if they didn't know. Second, you would imply to the student who answered, “If that's all you've got, please don't speak again.”

It's worth noting that the most persistent tells are usually in response to wrong answers, but we can also have tells for right answers—a big, bright face or perhaps the inflection on the word “*why*” in a statement like, “And can you tell us *why* you think Wilbur is afraid?” Clearly, it's not a negative to show appreciation and enthusiasm for a great answer. But it *is* worth considering whether that enthusiasm sometimes gives away too much, too soon or, if it's used too often, what its absence communicates. Ideally, we are all alert to our tells and manage them—replacing them as often as possible with a consistent and balanced expression of appreciation that's not quite approval.

# Praise Risk-Taking

The final aspect of creating a *Culture of Error* is to praise students for taking risks and facing down the challenge of a difficult subject. It's especially useful to encourage students to take risks when they're not sure. A statement such as, “This is a tough question. If you're struggling with it, that's a good sign. Now, who'll be bold and start us off?” reminds students that being a scholar means offering your thoughts when you're not sure, and sometimes *because* you're not sure. You can reinforce that positively by saying, for example, “I love the fact that this is a hard question and so

---

<!-- Page 243 -->

many of you have your hands in the air,” or you can shorthand that by simply referring to your students' “brave hands” when you see them raised (for example, “Who wants to take a shot at our challenge question? Beautiful. Love those brave hands … Diallo, what do you think?”). If discussing a particularly difficult passage in a book, you could try acknowledging the difficulty by saying something like, “This is a question that people have debated for decades, but you're really attacking this.” You can see Denarius Frazier do this in the *Culture of Error* montage. “Ohhh, I like this bravery,” he says, looking out at a handful of students willing to try to answer a difficult question. In a *Culture of Error*, students should feel good about stepping out on a limb, whether they're right or wrong.

# Putting It All Together: Jasmine Howard, Nicole Warren, and the Back (or Front) Table

The video *Jasmine Howard: College Bound* provides a beautiful example of *Standardize the Format*, *Active Observation*, *Show Me*, and *Culture of Error* in a single clip, shot in her eighth-grade math class at Freedom Prep in Memphis, Tennessee. She's chosen one problem within a larger problem set as a sort of gatekeeper. It's a sort of mid-class Exit Ticket. Jasmine circulates and observes. She's using a version of *Active Observation* that's more focused on preparing to give group feedback than on giving individual feedback to every student. Based on these observations, she reviews the problem with the whole class and, as she does so, uses *Show Me* to check that students arrived at answer A. She then sends students to independent practice but walks around and signals subtly to four students to meet her at the back table. There, Jasmine teaches a targeted mini-lesson for the students who needed more help, observing and supporting them as they work. Here you can see her *Standardizing the Format* as she asks students to circle the rate of change to ensure that they both calculated it correctly and know what it is. She does this with impeccable *Culture of Error*—steady, supportive, nonjudgmental. You can see how much the students feel this as they get up from their desks to come to the back table. The first student she taps starts to gather his things and move right away. He's not embarrassed and he's not trying to hide. He trusts in Jasmine to help him and you can see why when you watch her reteach. Jasmine has caught a simple misunderstanding early, before it snowballed, and adeptly has given them just the support they need to

---

<!-- Page 245 -->

understand the concept. It's one of the most impressive takes on differentiation through *Check for Understanding* I've had the pleasure of watching.

Not only that, but Jasmine's forming a group for reteaching in “real-time” *Checking for Understanding* reminded me of another clip of Nicole Warren doing something similar. You can see this in the clip *Nicole Warren: Front Table* in her third-grade classroom at Leadership Prep Ocean Hill. Nicole calls students up to the front table for extra practice after the previous day's *Exit Ticket* revealed that they continued to struggle with story problems.

In part, she told me, she wanted to pull them up front to watch them solve the problem “so I could stop them in the moment, if necessary, and be sure they were using the strategy we had discussed the day before. Since we already spent time debriefing this problem, I wanted to be sure they were practicing correctly to solidify the skill.”

In other words, Nicole observes all students carefully, but she also structured her classroom so she can occasionally observe students she's worried about even more carefully. Everyone gets real-time feedback; but this allows her to give a double dose to those who need it most. And you'll notice that they get a ton of feedback —positive in tone but rigorous—and they get the implicit feedback of knowing—when they are sent back to their seats—that they've mastered, at least for the moment, the skill that Nicole had targeted.

One of the most important things Nicole does to make her front table system work is to think about how to leverage her *Culture of Error*—there has to be no judgment, no stigma, no snickering about working at the front table. Nicole's messaging sets that up.

---

<!-- Page 246 -->

“Pulling a small group has never had a stigma. I think it has to do with how we frame it. We tell students, ‘This is a moment to get extra practice one-on-one or in a small group with your teacher.’ We never make this time feel negative in any way and students leave feeling successful, after getting the problem correct. We use stickers, high-fives, and smiles to commend them for showing effort through a tricky problem. In addition, the students who come up to the table are always different, based on the [most current] data. Sometimes it is students who are on the higher end, too. This helps to normalize the idea that everyone struggles and that this struggle is a part of the process that leads to mastery.”

By the way, a couple of other favorite *Teach Like a Champion* moments from this Nicole Willey clip: Nicole uses *Brighten the Lines* (*technique 28*), when she uses the prompt “Go!” after her directions to help ensure that students jump right into their work. She also uses *What to Do* (*technique 52*) beautifully to make sure one of her front-table scholars is listening to her feedback. The student looks like he wants to start going before he really hears what she’s saying, so she says, “Look at me” (twice!), in a warm, supportive tone backed by a smile.

Like Jasmine, Nicole has designed her classroom around the idea of *Checking for Understanding*.

# TECHNIQUE 13: SHOW CALL

Let’s return to what is perhaps the crucial moment in the clip from Denarius Frazier’s math class that we’ve been examining in the course of this chapter, *Denarius Frazier: Remainder*. Circulating and observing actively, Denarius recognizes that there’s something his students have

---

<!-- Page 247 -->

misunderstood about finding the remainder when dividing polynomials. He has recognized an error in real time but this is only half of the equation in *Checking for Understanding*. The second half, deciding how to address it, is a much more challenging question than it appears. Teachers bury the data—recognize student misunderstandings and fail to take action on them—all the time. In many cases this is because of the difficulty of changing one's lesson plan on the spur of the moment in front of thirty students. Or a failure to address the error may be due to the pressure of time. But Denarius hardly bats an eye. He chooses the work of a student, Fagan, who made a characteristic error, walks to the front of the room and projects it to the class. Seconds later the class is engaging with interest and openness in a study of the mistake, why it happened, and what it could teach them.

What's the quickest and most productive way to respond to an error in the midst of teaching, in other words? Often it's to study the error itself.

If you can pull that off, you have a simple, reliable tool to use in response to student errors. If students struggle to understand the first time, you may not have to plan a backup lesson or a new way of teaching the material if you can instead make a useful version of the error instantly visible and then build a culture that supports open study of the thinking that led to a mistake.

That's a powerful idea. If we can find and study our mistakes with openness and fascination, if we can discuss them in substantive conversations, then we have a replicable way to react to error when we see it and we are teaching a process we'd wish our students to copy for much of their lives: Find the mistake. Study it without defensiveness. Relish it as a learning opportunity.

---

<!-- Page 248 -->

The technique Denarius uses to accomplish this is *Show Call*, choosing a student's work and sharing it, visually, with the class so they are not just talking about it but studying it in a durable sustained way. An essential component of making this sustained study possible is the fact that the mistake is visible to all students. If Denarius had not projected Fagan's work to the class, the class would have learned far less from it.

This opportunity for learning is too important for Denarius to accept anything but the most productive example. Using *Show Call* effectively implies being able to choose deliberately whose work to project. A *Show Call* is therefore not just projecting work but selecting the example regardless of who's volunteered to share. *Show Call* is a visual Cold Call. To learn optimally from an example, students must see it well, and they need to be looking at just the right case study.

You will also probably notice that Fagan, the accomplished young woman whose work he's chosen, is not bothered when Denarius takes her paper. She doesn't look surprised, as you might expect her to have been. It's a familiar procedure, in other words, one that happens, if not daily, then regularly, and one that began with Denarius explaining to the class what he would do and why before he did it the first time. Then they practiced it—tried the idea out under controlled circumstances where success was more assured. For example, the first few times he used *Show Call*, Denarius probably focused on making *Show-Called* students feel honored by and comfortable with the process. Over time his *Show Calls* became more rigorous. Now he doesn't need to explain why he is taking Fagan’s or any student's paper, and students all have learned to engage in error analysis respectfully and productively.

---

<!-- Page 249 -->

Further, the culture Denarius has built—and which we can see him reinforcing in this clip—communicates the importance of studying mistakes and reinforces a strong sense of psychological safety for students as they do so. Ironically, students in classes like Denarius's often come to love *Show Call*. If they don't love it, they certainly see the value of it. In observing how Denarius approaches the technique we can learn a lot about why. It's also worth noticing that *Show Call*, used frequently, reinforces accountability for written work. On tomorrow's problem set, students will be strongly incented—perhaps even motivated—to do their best work. This will result in better and better examples to share with the class.

Notice Denarius's actions when he begins his *Show Call* and how much importance he assigns to the task of shared error analysis. He deliberately ensures full attention—notice his formal body language (technique 58, *Strong Voice*) and his use of a brief positive group correction, “Waiting on one” (see technique 55, *Least Invasive Intervention*), before commencing. He is communicating the heightened importance of the upcoming task.

As soon as he begins the process of studying a student mistake, he deliberately reinforces a few essential cultural messages. “As I walked around, on a few of our papers I'm noticing that we're getting an incorrect remainder,” he says. Immediately it's a “we” issue. He's going to show one example of what is a classwide challenge. Message: It's our work we're studying, not just that of a single *Show-Called* student. “We have check mechanisms in place that we can use to check this,” he says, again stressing the class’s group ownership of the problem and the solution.

Now to Fagan's work. “Snaps first to Fagan for using long division,” Denarius says. “You didn't have to use long division. You don't have to use synthetic. There's even

---

<!-- Page 250 -->

another approach that I saw on Quinetta's paper... ." In introducing Fagan's work, the teacher first establishes that there is plenty of successful work in the classroom, even if they are going to improve something about it. Fagan's first instinct may have been to think, *Oh, I got it wrong*, but in fact she **didn't** get it all wrong. She got a *small piece* of it wrong and a lot of it right. She's doing fine, and he's helping her to see that.

Notice also Denarius's emotional constancy and how he treats the error as being completely normal. As I discuss in *technique 12*, *Culture of Error*, Denarius establishes that mistakes are interesting, valuable even, and definitely not something a teacher gets frustrated at learners about. This is not a culture where people are afraid to discuss a mistake. Why would they be afraid when mistakes have been established as a necessary and helpful part of the learning process and the examination of them is a completely routine part of class?

Students do most of the analysis throughout this *Show Call*, even when he guides them to recognize that they should use the remainder theorem. Denarius doesn't solve the problem; all he really does is tell them how to perceive that their answer does not make sense. Once he's guided them to that realization, they know how to solve it.

*Show Call* is a simple and powerful concept but one that can feel risky to try for some teachers. If you've never done it, you can imagine how you or your students would feel if it didn't work.

In light of that I will describe a typical progression—what *Show Call* might look like at different stages in a classroom so the pathway to a lesson like Denarius's becomes clear. The technique involves shared culture and routines that must be intentionally built. A *Show Call* is unlikely to look

---

<!-- Page 251 -->

like Denarius's the first time a teacher and her students try it.

An early *Show Call* could, however, look a bit like Paul Powell's in the video *Paul Powell: Show Call*.

The student whose paper Paul takes is Kahlila. Here's a still shot of him doing that. Paul's pretty nonchalant in his body language—casual (see `technique 58`, *Strong Voice*), but Kahlila is not. It's likely she feels a bit anxious; even if Paul has explained what a *Show Call* is and why he does it, she's nervous. *My paper? Oh no!*

---

<!-- Page 252 -->

That's why Paul's framing when he presents student work is so important. “The theme of the day is showing your work,” Paul says. “So I'm going to show off Kahlila's work.” Suddenly everything has changed. My team and I refer to this moment in the *Show Call* as “the reveal”: the moment when you show the student work and frame how the class should think about it. You'll notice again and again how

---

<!-- Page 253 -->

important the reveal is in building culture. Kahlilia now knows that Paul's sharing her work is a good thing. He's showing it off.

“Look at that,” Paul continues, pointing out details of her now-projected work. “*Boom*. Formula. Plugged it in. Very neat. *Boom*.” If, a moment before, Kahlila's primary emotion was anxiety, it's now pride.

The culture Paul is building isn't simplistic, though. He's also sowing the seeds of self-study and improvement—a good-to-great culture. As he highlights the many things to love about Kahlila's work, he normalizes the process of making it better. “There's one little thing we're going to fix here in a second,” he says, making sure that the first few times he asks students to share their mistakes feel especially safe and nonthreatening.

A few moments later, Paul returns to the idea of improvement. “What is the one little thing she can fix?” he asks, and here is Kahlila's reaction:

---

<!-- Page 254 -->

00:54

There are lots of hands up, but Kahlila's is the straightest. Her body language is unmistakable. "Call on me now, Mr.

---

<!-- Page 255 -->

Powell! I can make it even better!” She's proud, in other words, and eager to show how much else she knows.

What we see here is not just a single *Show Call* that helps students to better see how to solve a problem and how to avoid a common mistake, but a procedure—and the culture to support it—that makes students feel lovingly accountable for their written work and unafraid of having it presented to the class. Paul's example is a road map for the first few times you use the technique; emphasize positivity and make students feel honored by and comfortable with the process.

Over time the goal is to build a culture in which, as we saw in Denarius's class, students understand implicitly that one of the ways they honor a classmate's work is by helping them to see both its success and also how to improve.

You can see this progression of Show Call culture clearly in the video *Ijeoma Duru: Almost-There Work*. Ijeoma is sharing the work of a student named Deborah and starts by asking students to give Deborah some “snaps and shine.” This ideally makes Deborah feel supported; it also, perhaps even more importantly, reminds the class: this is a classmate's work. We'll study it and improve it, but don't forget to be appreciative in your tone and comments as we discuss.

Like Denarius and Paul, Ijeoma uses her “reveal” to shape the culture that surrounds the *Show Call*: “Deborah has some ‘almost there’ work but I want us to work together and use her annotations to fix it,” she says. She then asks students to focus on the second half of Deborah's work and “snap if you see something you agree with.” This is a clever move. Every one of Deborah's classmates just affirmed that, like Fagan, she got plenty right in her answer. Even if there's something to improve on, there's a lot to the good and it's obvious to everyone. Ijeoma next asks a few students to describe what they agree with. This isn't just

---

<!-- Page 256 -->

about building Deborah up; it also reinforces their understanding. It's a form of Retrieval Practice ([technique 7](#)), encoding knowledge more deeply in long-term memory via recall and, here especially, elaboration. “Beautifully explained,” Ijeoma says to Jules, whom we can't see, after he has put the ideas he sees on the graph into new words. He's done well, but it was hard work. You could hear the labor in his voice. Memory is the residue of effort. He's worked hard to elaborate precisely, and this will help him remember and encode, and Ijeoma shows her appreciation for his work.

But there's another crucial benefit to *Show Call* that we see evidence of in Ijeoma's class. Deborah has annotated the diagram to show that there are corresponding angles in it—she's written the phrase across the side—but not *where* they are. She knows they're there —she just isn't sure how to find them. This underscores the critical and underrated role of perception in learning.

“She says that there must be corresponding angles somewhere,” Ijeoma says, referring to Deborah's annotation, “and I agree,” but then she asks: “Where should I place a star for the other angle that corresponds to that 25?” She calls on Michaela and as Michaela narrates her thought process, something very important is happening. *Everyone is looking at what Michaela is describing as she describes it.* If you want a group of people to problem solve, they need to all be looking at the same version of a problem. With the work projected, Ijeoma can guide students' eyes through their study of it. She is teaching them mathematical concepts *and how to perceive on their own when they apply*. While this is an example from a math class, perception is equally important, if not more critical, in studying a section of text, either from a writing or a close reading perspective. The discussion can be radically improved when a student states vaguely that

---

<!-- Page 257 -->

she likes the “details” or the “writing style” in a peer's passage. “Great,” you can suddenly say, “let's take a look at some of the details that stand out to you,” or “Great, let's read it together and annotate some of the lines that help her create such a distinctive tone.”

Learning starts, most often, with perception, something so basic we often overlook it. Most of our brain is a system for visual perception—much of it unconscious. We look where we look out of habit, and if we learn to look in the right places, we're far more likely to be successful. Decisions almost always start with our eyes. In that sense, students are a bit like athletes. Those who see at a glance where to pass or how to block an opponent make their decisions first and foremost because they are looking for the right things and in the right places. Their eyes go to the parts of a problem where the relevant signal will appear. This is a key piece of their expertise. The more expert the decision maker, the more likely this precise looking is to happen. Or perhaps it's the other way around. The more likely a decision maker is to look at the right things, the more expert they are likely to be.12 Projecting a problem allows us to engage student's perception in the problem-solving process. In a moment, I'll show you another example of this.

*Show Call* works because there is learning power in looking: we build students' perception ability. The content that we look at together remains fixed in students' attention and engages the portions of their brains—the majority of the brain—that rely on and process visual information.

Watch how powerfully Julia Addeo leverages the idea of guided or shared perception in the video *Julia Addeo: Expand*, in which she *Show Calls* Monet's work and where Monet, interestingly, has made two different efforts to solve

---

<!-- Page 258 -->

a problem. Julia doesn't tell students which one is correct. The goal is for students to discern which solution is correct and why—or for them to be able to look and perceive what mathematical tool will work. Notice how focused on perception Julia's questions are: “What did Monet do on the left?” The first student Julia calls on does not correctly perceive the strategy Monet is using and Julia's response is powerful. “What did she do in this first line here?” She still hasn't told them the answer; she's just helping them know where to see it.

*Show Call* can also work by asking students to use comparative judgment—it can place two examples close together and ask students to discern the differences. When the next student describes Monet's first step correctly, Julia labels it. Now that they can see the math, she wants to associate a name with it. “Let's write that in our notes: expand,” Julia says. Now they can see what it looks like and associate it with its technical name. Then another perception question: “Once she [Monet] expanded, what did she do then?” And then for the other side, Julia again asks a perception-based question, “What did she do?” To perceive is to understand. Now that they understand the steps Monet took in each case, students have to decide which solution was more useful. Julia goes to a *Turn and Talk* ([technique 43](#)) and then uses *Show Me* ([technique 10](#)).

In the video *Rousseau Mieze: Source Line*, you can observe Rousseau *Show Calling* two examples of student work and asking the class to discern why one of them is stronger than the other. Once again this demonstrates how *Show Call* can be especially powerful when it asks students to compare examples because it leverages the power of a cognitive principle called “the law of comparative judgment”—simply put, this is the idea that people are better at making comparisons between pieces of work than at making absolute judgments about quality. Humans are

---

<!-- Page 259 -->

likely to learn more by comparing one piece of work to another, rather than to an abstract standard.13 Want students to see the subtle differences between good and great writing? Show them two different examples and suddenly the conversation will accelerate—and the subtler the differences, the more advanced and more nuanced a conversation they will yield. In other words, if you want to do really rigorous study of student writing, compare a very good example to a great one. Or show the class two similar approaches and study how the small differences allow them to achieve different ends. “I want to talk about which one is strongest,” Rousseau tells the class in his reveal. Then notice how he reads the two student answers aloud, one immediately after the other, to make subtle differences as apparent to students as possible.

The video *Rose Bernunzio: Good Catch* also shows the benefit of using *Show Call* to compare two students' work, and it’s worth comparing some of the similarities and differences between Rose’s approach and Rousseau’s. Both begin with a question that emphasizes perception—essentially, what’s the difference—and both intentionally try to boost their ratio in this critical moment, getting every student to discuss via a *Turn and Talk*. They want everyone doing this cognitive work. But whereas Rousseau asks students to “snap it up” for two classmates whom he identifies, Rose deliberately keeps the identities of her students anonymous. Balancing anonymity and credit is a variable you can consider in the “reveal.”

There are also variables in the “take,” the name we use for another key culture-setting part of the *Show Call*, the moment when you take a student's paper. Do you explain why? Do you merely take it and presume it’s understood? Do you ask? In this case, Rose subtly asks the student whose paper she takes. It’s more of a courtesy than anything else. Rose also diffuses the pressure a bit by

---

<!-- Page 260 -->

saying, “Lots of people are making this mistake.” Ironically, the “take” is often smoother if it’s simpler. Rousseau, like Denarius and Paul, uses an “unnarrated take.” He does not ask permission. It’s important to note that he can do this because, in his classroom, *Show Calling* is an established procedure that students understand clearly. And because a *Culture of Error* is intact, an unnarrated take won’t work without those things in place. Another important difference between the clips is what happens afterwards. Rousseau asks students to revise their answers. Rose asks students to apply the same method to parts B and C of the problem. Two slightly different applications of an idea we also saw in Ijeoma’s *Show Call*, which ended with the phrase “Make sure you have this written on your paper.” The message in all three cases is: *We just spent a lot of time learning something important; make sure you have it down.* This foreshadows technique 14, *Own and Track*.

*Show Call* can also help students to see and understand their mistakes by showing the solution rather than the error. You can see Sarah Wright do the first of those in the video *Sarah Wright: Show Call Discussion*. In her study of the novel *Esperanza Rising*, her reveal explains the purpose of her *Show Call*: “We are going to *Show Call* some students’ work, have them explain their work a little bit, and then you’ll be able to add to your paper.” She’s *Show Called* some of the strongest pieces of work in the room; she wants the rest of the class to take notes on the gaps between their own work and these examples. Multiple times she returns to Trey’s paper to point out what’s excellent about it. She uses Trey’s observations, perhaps the strongest in the class, to start a conversation in which students expand and elaborate on his ideas. What they ultimately write down is Trey’s answer plus the class’s further reflections on the best-written ideas that emerged.

A final note: *Show Call* appeared in TLAC 2.0 as part of a section on Building Ratio. And, indeed, it does boost the amount of cognitive work that students do, but it's most powerful, I have been arguing, as a tool to respond to error as a group, and so I have moved it to an earlier spot in the text. That said, as Sarah intimates here, it is also an excellent tool for revising and expanding ideas and so I will return to it in [Chapter 8](#), “Building Ratio Through Writing.”

# During the Show Call: Two Key Moments

There are two especially important moments to manage during a *Show Call*: the *take*—the moment when you take a student's paper off his or her desk with the intent to project it—and the *reveal*—the moment when you show the work to the class. What you say and how you frame what you are doing are especially important at these points of inflection.

## The Take

The goal is to make the *take* feel familiar to a student. We want to remind them that *Show Call* is an everyday event and that almost everyone's work will be projected at some point. And we want *Show Call* to feel safe. Nothing bad or humiliating will happen. In many ways those things go together. A seamless “take” where the teacher calmly selects a students’ paper from their desk and says very little—perhaps offers a nod of thanks or a brief smile, or whispers “Can I borrow this?” mostly as a courtesy—communicates best the calm normalcy of *Show Call*. It suggests routine.

That said, “If the culture is built right” is a statement not to take lightly. Strong positive cultures constantly need reinforcement and reinvigoration, so mixing in a bit of positive framing is also sometimes helpful. Arielle Hoo offers a great example of that in the video *Arielle Hoo: Strong Work*. “I’m coming around to look for strong work to *Show Call*,” she says matter-of-factly, reminding students that *Show Call* is an honor. Suddenly, Ms. Hoo lingering at your desk is a sign that all is well. Then you’ll notice when she takes Tyler’s paper she looks at it admiringly but says nothing:

---

<!-- Page 263 -->

An alternative might be a quiet explanation to a student to remind them of the purpose: “Your work is really interesting. I'd love to share it with the class.” You might do more such framing early on in your use of *take*, transitioning later to more unnarrated takes. But less is often more. There are definitely times to say, “Oh, this is great. I can't wait to share it,” but if you have to say it every time you wish to “take” a paper, it becomes nearly meaningless.

In some cases (it's early in the year and you're building culture; or a student may be self-conscious about the mistake they've made) a bit more of an “ask” is appropriate with the take, but often a simple statement of purpose preceding the question is helpful: “I'd love to share this with the class, OK?” is even better than “Can I share this with the class?” A smile or some positive

---

<!-- Page 264 -->

words of affirmation, “You're doing fine; I'd love to share your work,” always helps. It can also help to crouch down and put yourself on an eye level with the student.

It's up to you whether you want to give students the right to say no when you ask, but for most teachers, it's more of a courtesy than a real option. That said, if a student were to object, you might respond with, “Well, let's see how it goes. I really think it will be worthwhile,” or “OK, how about if I keep you anonymous?” or “Why don't I start, and if you get uncomfortable you can signal me to stop.”

## The Reveal

The way you “reveal” written work to the class frames the way students interpret it and sets the tone for the rest of the Show Call. One factor to consider is whether you want to name the student whose work you show. Naming a student can help you make Show Call feel like a reward, but anonymity can be effective as well, especially if it makes you and your students more comfortable being constructively and positively critical in the revision stage.

Another important part of the reveal is whether and how the work is read. You could have students read it silently, but often you or a student may want to read part of it aloud. Reading written work with expression, careful attention, and appreciation is one of the best and most sincere ways to show how much you value and appreciate it. It also unlocks much of the meaning and expression in the words.

A last factor in the reveal is whether you want to tell students what they should look for (“Let's look to see if Martina has used active, dynamic verbs. What do you

---

<!-- Page 265 -->

think?”) or use a nondirective reveal (“Here's what Martina wrote. What do you think?”) A directive reveal can help you be more efficient and focused, ensuring a tight, productive discussion on what’s *most important*. Giving students more latitude via a nondirective reveal can allow students to simulate the revision process more closely and to identify issues they consider relevant. Noting what students observe unprompted can also be a useful source of data.

Arielle Hoo's clip is a model of subtlety. The reveal, “Let's take a look at Tyler's work. Tyler, please explain what you did to check,” is a model of *Culture of Error*. She's calm and steady but withholds the answer. Only after Tyler's description of his own work does it turn out that he's checked his work in a way that a few students have forgotten to do. Then there's further study by the class of all the reminders of strong mathematical habits that his solution provides.

## Low-Tech *Show Call*

No document camera in your classroom? So be it. While you're in the process of petitioning district higher-ups to provide the single most useful and affordable piece of technology to enhance teaching available, here are four ways to do a low-tech *Show Call* in the meantime:

1. *Show Call* a piece of writing from yesterday's class or last night's homework by collecting it and making a transparency for use with the 1980s version of the document camera: the overhead projector. There's probably one sitting in a closet somewhere.
2. If there's no overhead projector, you can always simply copy the student work (last night's homework or yesterday's in-class writing) and ask students to edit at their desks.
3. Ask students to work on “slates”—mini whiteboards students can write on at their desks. Select one and show it to the class as your *Show Call*.
4. Transcribe a crucial sentence from one student's work on the board and “live edit” it with the class. My colleague Paul Bambrick-Santoyo recommends using flip chart paper for this purpose. Then the notes that capture the class's analysis can live on in your classroom as a permanent record of your collective thinking.

## TECHNIQUE 14: OWN AND TRACK

One morning a few years ago I stopped in on Bryan Belanger's math class. Bryan had given his students this

---

<!-- Page 267 -->

problem to solve:  
Which of the following functions would be parallel to the line y = 3x? Select all that apply.

A y = -3x -5 B y = 3x -5 C y = -3x  
D y = -3x +5 E y = 3x +5 F y = 3x +0

He *Cold Called* students to name the correct answers, and most students understood the problem very quickly and eliminated A, C, and D, though one or two choose A as the correct answer, so Bryan quickly reviewed: “What must every answer need to have to be correct?” he asked.

“A slope of 3,” a student replied, so Bryan annotated the problem, writing “m = 3” above the prompt and asked his students to do the same. He didn't want to just correct the understanding, he wanted them to have a record of it.

Then Bryan challenged his students. “Actually,” he said, “one of the three other answers is also not correct. Can anyone tell me which one and why?”

He took hands here, and one of his students observed that “F had the same slope but also the same y-intercept.”

“Yes,” Bryan said. “That's subtle but important. It's the same line and a line can't technically be parallel to itself.”

Then again Bryan locked down the teaching point through mark-up.

He asked students to be sure to cross out answer F in their packets and to write in the margin “same line” so they remembered not only that F wasn't correct but why. Then he had them add a note so that above parallel they wrote: “Same slope but different y-intercept.”

Thus in the end students had in front of them a perfect record of what they'd learned. It looked something like this:

---

<!-- Page 268 -->

Which of the following functions would be parallel to the line y=3x? Select all that apply.  
*M=3 but parallel= same slope but different y-intercept*

A: y=-3x-5  
B: y=3x-5  
C: y=-3x  
D: y=-3x+5  
E: y=3x+5  
F: y=3x+0  
*The same line*

Bryan's actions were intended to increase the value of the time he spent studying common errors by making sure that students took careful note of what they learned. They knew not only which were the right answers, but which one had fooled many of them and why. And they had the rule as they now understood it handy for easy review. That's the idea behind *Own and Track*. If you're going to invest time studying mistakes, make sure students get the most out of it by “owning” the learning and tracking it.

Studying mistakes can be powerful but it's not without risks. It can lead to confusion on the part of students. They could walk away unsure of which part of the discussion was correct, with the muddled and confused memory that there were lots of ways to be wrong, but, hmmm, which was right? In fact, there's research to suggest that discussing wrong answers can result in students, especially the weakest students, failing to differentiate correct answers from incorrect ideas and merely remembering even better the errors you describe. One study found that “incorrect examples supported students' negative knowledge more than correct examples.” Error analysis benefited only students who had a strong working knowledge of how to arrive at the answer already, and students needed an “advanced” level of understanding before they were ready to benefit from analyzing errors. For other students, it actually made things worse! Now that is a note of caution!

---

<!-- Page 269 -->

An additional way in which error analysis can go awry would be that you invest a ton of time studying mistakes and students just don't attend to it very intently. The cognitive scientists Kirshner, Sweller, and Clark point out that any lesson that does not result in a change in long-term memory has not resulted in learning. A terrific discussion is important to building understanding but hasn't achieved learning yet. Students have to remember it. Thus, the more time you invest in studying error, the more important it is to end with students having a written record of key insights, terms, and annotation. They need a record of what they've learned both to refer back to later and to build their memory as they go by, causing them to engage with the intention of remembering. These kinds of activities are part of the final CFU technique, *Own and Track*.

We will distill this *Own and Track* process down to three possible steps that teachers can encourage students to follow:

1. Lock in the “right” answer in writing.  
   Make sure at the end of your error analysis that students know what the right answer was.

2. Get “meta” (metacognitive) about wrong answers.  
   Have students take notes on why wrong answers were wrong. That's often where you spend most of your teaching time. It's immensely valuable because it's a window into students' confusion. But as we know, forgetting happens fast. They should track the learnings so they can review them later and be more likely to remember them.

3. Get “meta” about the right answers, too.  
   It's also useful to have students make notes on why correct answers were correct.

---

<!-- Page 270 -->

Below you can see an example of all three from science teacher Vicki Hernandez's class. Her class was discussing photosynthesis.^14 As you can see, the right answer is clearly marked. And in the box the student has explained to herself why that answer is right. She's also explained why each wrong answer is wrong. This is a student with deep understanding of the question and a record of it for future reference.

Certain poisons are toxic to organisms because they interfere with the function of enzymes in the mitochondria. This results directly in the inability of the cell to...

A) Store information. (nucleus DNA, nucleus stores DNA)

B) Build proteins. (proteins ≠ energy) Ribosomes do this!

C) Release energy from nutrients

D) Dispose of metabolic wastes (cell membrane does this, not mitochondria)

C is correct because the function of mitochondria is to provide the cell with energy, and so toxins would interfere with the release of energy.

In the video Vicki Hernandez: Let’s Make a Note, Vicki starts with appreciation for the student whose work she has Show Called, praising him for correcting his own answer. She also has the work clearly displayed on her document camera, so the students can see Vicki make notes on the correct answer. She's seen that the common error was a confusion around grass, so she asks them to lock in what they learned about what confused them. “Grass,” she says (and writes), “is a producer because it is a plant and goes through photosynthesis.”

---

<!-- Page 271 -->

Own and Track is a critical time for Circulation and Active Observation, as you provide time for students to explain the right answer, appropriately denote the wrong answer, and label their errors. You'll see that in Vicki's clear scan at the end of her clip—she knows the bit of information about grass is critically important for her students, and so she takes the time to make sure everyone has jotted it down.

Another way to help students engage with the content as they correct their answer is to have them reflect on the steps that they did (or did not) take, as Paul Powell did at the end of the video *Paul Powell: Show Call*. Paul and his students have established the correct answer for a multiple-choice question. “Are you showing your work even on a multiple-choice question?” he asks. “Pick your pencil up and give yourself a check for each one of these steps.” By building in this written reflection for students, Paul not only ensures they walk away with a clear understanding of what is right (and what is wrong); he also guarantees that their papers reflect the process they took to arrive at the accurate answer; a valuable engagement task turns into a record of lasting value. Some things you could say to help students Own and Track include:

- “Give yourself a check for every one of these steps that you got correct. If you're missing one, make a note to yourself.”
- “Circle answer B and write a margin note that explains that it uses the wrong operation.”
- “Draw a line through the [insert grammar mistake] and rewrite it correctly in the space in the margin.”
- “Make your paper look like mine.”
- “Reread your response. Add at least one piece of evidence from our discussion to better support your answer.”

---

<!-- Page 272 -->

"I'm coming around to check that you've defined *fortuitous* in the margin and that your definition includes the word *lucky*."

You can see the benefit of this written record of learning in action in the video *Jon Bogard: Back to Your Notes*. After a robust conversation trying to determine the nature of a classmate's error, a student, India, has the chance, as Jon puts it, to “arbitrate.” To determine who is wrong and who is right, she refers back to her notes—with great glee, I might add—to prove that her conclusion is correct. (Don't miss the snaps of support from her classmates, which validate India's scholarly engagement and the high-five from the student in front of her after she drops her evidence on the class.) Here we see the long-term benefit of a clear *Own and Track* system. India is able to engage in this analysis independently because she has referred back to notes that she took the previous day. Then we see the system in action: Jon says to his students, “Fifteen seconds, back to your notes, update what you had before in light of what India just said.” He capitalizes on the moment of her insight by asking every student to record it, both increasing the chances that they will remember it and creating a record of it that they will be able to refer back to.

# Lessons from Online

Some of our greatest lessons from remote and online instruction have to do with *Checking for Understanding*. The video *Sadie McCleary: Get You There*, for example, is an exceptional example of how to create a *Culture of Error* online. The first thing you'll notice is that the video is a montage of tiny moments from one of Sadie's chemistry lessons at Western Guilford High School in Greensboro, North Carolina. *Culture of Error* is built up through the aggregation of tiny moments from throughout your lessons. It's a seasoning you are frequently shaking on the meal. But if AP Chemistry is challenging in the classroom, it's exponentially harder when learned on your laptop. Sadie normalizes the struggle constantly and gracefully. She asks Sierra to explain the impact of solution B on reaction rate from a slide she's projecting. “I'm going to be honest, Ms. McCleary,” Sierra replies. “I'm so confused.”

“That's OK,” Sadie replies, but then continues, “I'm going to ask you a couple of questions to get you there—because I know you can get there.” Her tone is steady and without judgment. She expresses her belief in Sierra. And then they get to work. So much of what students are responding to when they develop a sense of trust in a teacher, my colleague Dan Cotton observes, is the teacher's competence. Sadie is calm and confident when she finds that the material is difficult for Sierra and she reminds Sierra that it's a struggle, not a crisis—they'll get to work and solve the problem.

Later in the lesson Sadie is more proactive. “Finding the units for K is always the hardest skill of this unit and if it feels tricky that's OK ... we'll continue to practice it.”

---

<!-- Page 274 -->

She's reminding students beforehand that parts of chemistry are difficult—for everyone—and that they don't need to respond to difficulty with panic or frustration but with steady diligence and the willingness to practice.

Later again in the lesson Sadie asks Kendall to explain how to get the exponent in an equation. Kendall's answer is wrong, but Sadie's first words are telling: “I'm glad you said that. That's not why. That's not where we get our exponents, but Kendall has lifted up something that is a common mistake. The coefficients do not matter ... you have to use your concentration data, and we're going to keep practicing that.” Earlier I noted that one key to building a *Culture of Error* was to diffuse defensiveness and anxiety about mistakes while still making it clear that mistakes were mistakes. Sadie does that beautifully here. It's a useful answer, she notes—she's glad Kendall offered it—because it's wrong. Sadie's management of her tell is impeccable: She's warm and supportive and unflappable. Her first words are of appreciation and then she gets down to explaining the useful lesson of Kendall's answer.

# Notes

1. The first Forgetting Curve was drawn by Hermann Ebbinghaus in 1885, tracing the rate at which he remembered (or failed to remember) nonsense syllables. The findings have been replicated in principle but how quickly forgetting happens in any specific case depends on who is trying to remember what and under what conditions. Still the principle endures across settings: forgetting starts right away and is always at work. Repetition matters.

Clark, “Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching,” *Educational Psychologist* 41, no. 2 (2006): 75-86, doi: 10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1.

3. You might be wondering *How many times do I have to review a concept to get it into long-term memory?* There's no clear answer—a lot depends on who is learning what, when—but in his long-term study of student learning, *The Hidden Lives of Learners*, Graham Nuthall found that he and his colleagues could predict with 80-85 percent accuracy whether a student in a given class would learn something they did not previously know, based on whether they had encountered the full concept three different times during class. Given that students are sometimes not paying full attention or do not get the whole concept and that facility and speed of access continue to increase and improve one's ability to perceive and connect, there may be an argument for more than three repetitions for many concepts, even if Nuthall is correct.

4. Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel elaborate on elaboration in *Make It Stick*: “Elaboration is the process of giving new material meaning by expressing it in your own words and connecting it with what you already know. The more you can explain about the way your new learning relates to your prior knowledge, the stronger your grasp of the new learning will be and the more connections you create that will help you remember it later” (p. 5).

5. Factual knowledge enhances cognitive processes like problem solving and reasoning. The richer the knowledge base, the more smoothly and effectively these

cognitive processes—the very ones that teachers target—operate. https://www.aft.org/periodical/american-educator/spring-2006/how-knowledge-helps.

6. “What you know determines what you see,” write Karl Hendrick and Paul Kirschner; it is the knowledge you have deeply encoded in long-term memory and can access simply and easily in the blink of an eye that allows you to see more—literally and figuratively.

7. For this reason I don’t personally use the term “aggressive monitoring” as it can unintentionally reinforce this transactional feel in application. “Active Observation” is a bit more neutral to me but if you prefer “aggressive monitoring” that’s fine. It’s a common term and there’s an argument for using *lingua franca*.

8. She also does a nice job of double-checking on Juliana by asking her to rework the original problem while others start in on a new problem. This is a demonstration of the effort Dani has put into building a *Culture of Error* that results in students feeling psychological safety. See technique 12 for more on how teachers like Dani do this.

9. The idea that both Hilary and Jessica use a ticket metaphor for their *Affirmative Checking* is coincidental and actually fairly atypical.

11. You can see examples of this in two clips from Jon Bogard’s classroom from this chapter. Note the snaps of support “India” gets in the video *Jon Bogard: Back to Your Notes* from the technique *Own and Track* and in the support various students get in the clip *Jon Bogard: Go to IP*.

13. As I note in [Chapter Five](https://teachlikeachampion.com/blog/dylan-wiliam-advises-forget-rubric-use-work-samples-instead/), Dylan Wiliam has applied this idea to the idea of self-assessment. Giving students work samples to compare to their own is far more effective than using a rubric.
