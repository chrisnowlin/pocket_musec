# Chapter 9  
## Building Ratio Through Discussion  

Stephen Covey observed more than thirty years ago that “most people do not listen with the intent to understand. They listen with the intent to reply.”^1 This observation has perhaps never been truer than today, when we risk running classrooms that echo the increasingly dominant and counterproductive forms of discussion evidenced on social media—one side blasting a point of view they are sure cannot be wrong or even nuanced at the opposite side, who are busy preparing an equally righteous return salvo. The goal of being proven right in a discussion is very different from the goal of learning from it. Without careful listening, a clear shared purpose, and a sense that discussion is supposed to add to our collective and individual understanding, we’re not really getting what we should out of it. Perhaps without those things we’re not even discussing at all.  

It is at least worth asking whether our classrooms might unintentionally be contributing to the larger social trend of discourse characterized by an excess of righteous pronouncements and far less listening or seeking nuance. Do we teach our students to listen well? That a question can be more powerful than a pronouncement? To assume their first impression might be wrong, and just maybe to believe they have succeeded if and when they changed their thinking? Wisdom, mostly, is realizing how little you know. How much talking there is and how avidly it’s offered is often the criteria by which we measure our discussions. Talking, after all, is easy to see and measure. But we might be better served by socializing students to listen and proceed with a mindset that says, “I probably have a lot to

---

<!-- Page 623 -->

learn from others.” It would be harder but perhaps more valuable to measure our discussions based on listening as much as talking.

*Effective* discussions in the classroom are rare. Many people might say this is because it's hard to get students to talk. In fact, what teachers *tell students* they want them to do during discussion is almost always to talk more. Students are graded on their participation and that usually means how often they talk, and perhaps with bonus points for strength of opinion. A *good* discussion, in this paradigm, is lots of students talking, and a *great* one is lots of students talking *and expressing opinions strongly and confidently*. Colby argues forcefully and repeatedly about the Kansas-Nebraska Act and we are happy. Look at him fighting for his ideas!2 He knows what he believes and won't be swayed!

To talk a lot is to succeed. To talk louder, to be more ardent in one's opinions and beliefs, is to succeed more.

But talking only improves student thinking if it is part of an exchange and if people are listening to one another—ideally with open minds inclined to consider and potentially change initial reactions and opinions. A true discussion requires students to listen well and respond after careful consideration. Perhaps the idea that Colby is sure of what he believes and won't be swayed is not an entirely good thing.

Further, for a discussion to be effective, the purpose must be more than to prove that you are right and others are wrong. The name for that is a debate. In the classroom, the goal should be to learn from rather than win the discussion—to inform rather than confirm what you thought you knew. All participants then are working to ultimately answer the question: what have I or we learned from this process?

In this chapter I am going to talk about talking but I am going to try to talk at least as much about listening. While we should encourage speaking, it's the listening—and maybe ideally the speaking in conjunction with careful listening—that's most valuable in our discussions.

A clear mental model is a good starting point. Something other than “talk more and talk louder” should shape our purpose. If we aren't clear on how discussion is different from students merely talking, students talking may be all we get.3

In this chapter I discuss tools for building more productive discussions. I'll begin with *Turn and Talk*, a procedure for pair discussions. One benefit of a classroom where pair conversations are excellent is that those conversations can support and improve many of the habits that support larger whole-group discussions. Second, I'll talk about *Habits of Discussion*, which describes how to build productive habits to foster collaboration and cohesiveness in discussions. I'll then discuss *Batch Processing*: letting students speak after and respond to one another often in short sequences. I'll close with *Disciplined Discussion*, which suggests that helping people stay on topic and follow a thread is an overlooked skill. We tend to valorize “outside the box” ideas but “inside the box” comments are often far more valuable.

## TECHNIQUE 43: TURN AND TALK

*Turn and Talk*—a short, contained pair discussion—is a common teaching tool used in thousands of classrooms and it offers a lot of benefits. Among others:

- It boosts Participation Ratio. You say “Why is Scout afraid? *Turn and Talk* to your partner for thirty seconds. Go!” and suddenly fifteen voices are going at

---

<!-- Page 625 -->

once instead of just one. In a short time you've allowed almost everyone the chance to share an answer.

- It can increase reluctant students' willingness to speak in larger settings. A student rehearses an idea she might not offer in front of thirty people, and finds it comes out well or earns admiration from her partner. She becomes more willing to share her idea with the whole group.

- It's a great response when the class appears stuck. You ask a question, get only a smattering of hands or perhaps none at all, and respond: “Hmmm. No one seems quite sure. *Turn and Talk* with your partner for thirty seconds. See if you can come up with some ideas. Go!” Suddenly you have a workaround for explaining the answer.

- It can allow you to listen in on conversations and choose valuable comments to start discussion with, as in, “Maria, would you mind sharing what you and Justine talked about?”

But there are challenges to go with the benefits. Because it *can* result in fifteen people talking at once does not mean it *will*, and a disengaged *Turn and Talk* where there's little turning and even less talking is a culture killer. And there are a variety of accountability challenges:

- Conversations may wander off the assigned topic and may never even address the topic at all. (It is, after all, exciting to have the chance to chat with your friend in the middle of class.)

- There is the risk that students in a *Turn and Talk* listen poorly—that their partner is merely a target for their own words and not a source of insight.

---

<!-- Page 626 -->

- Even if everyone is on topic and listening their hardest, erroneous information could still spread. Billy Knowsforsure tells Tammy Tendstobelieve that to take the square root of something means to divide it by two; she nods, begins committing it to memory, and you never know it. Education researcher Graham Nuthall, carefully observing students during lessons, 4 found that students frequently persuaded their classmates that erroneous information was true. The most credulous were likely to be those with the weakest knowledge on a topic.

So *used frequently* does not always imply *used well*. The details of execution are critical. BreOnna Tindall's execution of her *Turn and Talk* in the video *BreOnna Tindall: Keystone* provides a road map. Students have read a short passage about the idea of “blind justice” and have been asked to discuss whether the idea of justice being blind is supposed to be a positive or a negative symbol. BreOnna gives a direction: “One minute to *Turn and Talk*. Share out your response with your face partner. Go!” Suddenly, the room crackles to life.

Her success starts with the directions. They are crisp and clear, without an extraneous word, *economy of language* exemplified. The speed and energy of the transition capped off by the cue to action “Go!” means that everyone starts at exactly the same time. No one has time or incentive to glance around and see if their peers are really doing it. In these ways her directions exemplify technique 28, *Brighten the Lines*.

Of course it's critical that *Turn and Talk* is a familiar procedure. BreOnna has taught her students how to do *Turn and Talk* well and they've practiced it. You can see their familiarity with it in the video. They know who their partner is without having to ask; they start their

---

<!-- Page 627 -->

conversations comfortably and naturally; they speak at the appropriate volume. And perhaps most of all, the practice has taught them that since everyone is going to join in the *Turn and Talk* with energy and enthusiasm, they can safely do the same. This lack of hesitation is one of the main reasons why just seconds after the prompt, the room crackles to life.

Interestingly, it's not just one procedure. As the phrase “*Turn and Talk* with your *face partner*” implies, there are *face partners* and also *shoulder partners*. BreOnna can keep things fresh by shifting which partner students talk to. Her room layout is designed around *Turn and Talk*!

And don't overlook her phrase “share out your response” as it implies something important. Of course, they have plenty to say. Students have written first and are sharing what they wrote. As with whole group discussions, writing first means a more substantive and inclusive partner discussion (see [technique 40](#), *Front the Writing*). As we will see, *Turn and Talk* works best when designed for synergy with what happens before and after.

Finally, BreOnna tells her students they will have (just) one minute to talk. This helps them gauge the appropriate length of their comments. And, ironically, keeping the *Turn and Talk* short maximizes its value. It's a preliminary to the larger class discussion, so BreOnna wants students to have more to say, still, when it's over. She doesn't want them to say everything yet.

You can see many of the same themes in the video *Sarah Wright: Keystone*. First, Sarah asks a question: “Imagine you are Tio Luis [in Pam Muñoz-Ryan's novel *Esperanza Rising*], what would you say?” This is a reiteration of a question they have already responded to in writing, and now they get to share their brilliance. There are hands in the air. Lots. Students are eager to talk so this might seem

---

<!-- Page 628 -->

like a surprising moment to choose a *Turn and Talk*. One of its best uses, I noted earlier, is to help build engagement when students are hesitant. But here it's useful for the opposite reason. When you have lots of eager hands, *Turn and Talk* can be a great way to let everyone get to talk and to minimize the *I had a great answer and didn't get to share it* frustration.

Like in BreOnna's classroom, Sarah's directions are crisp and clear with no extra words. They end in a consistent in-cue—the same as Breonna's, “Go!”—and again the room crackles to life. You can then see Sarah circulating, listening to answers, sharing her appreciation, and also perhaps deciding whom to call on.

But again, not every *Turn and Talk* looks like these. How does a teacher build this level of energy and productivity?

The first step is ensuring that students feel responsible for doing the task in front of them to the best of their ability. Once you've done that, you can begin to design the activity for maximum rigor. This “all in” attitude is achieved mostly through intentional habit-building. In the videos, neither BreOnna nor Sarah tells their students, “Be attentive; be active; do your best, and talk about the topic at hand.” Those things are understood. Students do them automatically, which means they are carefully taught and reinforced until they become routine.

## Build the Routine

A *Turn and Talk* is a recurring classroom procedure; a common means for students to engage ideas. The more frequently something recurs in the classroom, the more important to make it a routine—to map the steps of the procedure, then rehearse and repeat it until it happens smoothly and with almost no drain on working memory. You can read more in [Chapter Ten] about installing routines but

---

<!-- Page 629 -->

some specific aspects of the *Turn and Talk* routine deserve specific comment.

“My *Turn and Talks* actually used to be pretty ineffective,” BreOnna shared. “[Students] would not talk—or they would talk about something else.” Now, though, she builds in “an extensive rollout where I explain ‘this is what I’m expecting [active on-topic conversations; asking questions of each other], this is the type of language I want to hear [academic vocabulary]. I want to see these actions [nodding; facing each other; showing your partner you’re listening].’ It could seem a little Type A but I honestly think kids just don’t know how to have an academic conversation in a way that brings out the best in their partner. I try to make sure they have all the tools before they need them.”

Who partners with whom should be set in advance so that conversations can begin without further action or discussion, as they do in BreOnna’s and Sarah's classes. Generally, partners should be pairs who are sitting side by side and should commonly remain partners for the duration of a lesson—although, as I noted, BreOnna's students have two potential partner pairings: a shoulder partner and a face partner. In Sarah's class, there is just one partner but in both cases, that partner is clearly established before class begins.

The value is not just in the fact that when students are chatting with a partner within two seconds, they’re using time efficiently. It’s that a fast and familiar transition preserves continuity of thinking. Whatever was on their mind as they were writing remains in their working memory as they enter the *Turn and Talk*. Five or ten seconds spent looking for a partner or scanning the room to see if everybody is doing the *Turn and Talk* is more than enough to remove a key thought from working memory.

---

<!-- Page 630 -->

In other words, for the sake of the thinking, the transition needs to be smooth, precise, and almost invisibly efficient.

## The In-Cue

Watch the students during the *Turn and Talks* in the video *Christine Torres: Keystone*. The first one starts with Christine asking: “How does the image show *implore*? Fifteen seconds with your teammate. Go!”

A few minutes later she asks: “What *caustic* remark might the judge have made? Fifteen seconds to *Turn and Talk*. Go.”

In each case the cue is short, crisp, and sharp and the response is decisive momentum-building energy—enthusiasm might be a better word—from the class.

Think high school students won't do that? Watch Denarius Frazier's students at the beginning of the video *Denarius Frazier: Keystone*: “Tell your neighbor what you want to remember every time we're doing synthetic division.” Or Sadie McCleary's at the beginning of her *Keystone*: “With your partner: What happens as you increase temperature to the pressure of a gas and why, based on particle motion? Go!”

There's not an ounce of reluctance or cynicism in sight. Students in these videos are showing us that they perceive and react to classroom norms. If students look around the room and see hesitation, if they don't see others turning and talking right away, they won't perceive the activity to be the norm. Some students won't do it and those who do will be likely to feign as much participation as is required but to seek to do the bare minimum.

But if students perceive in the first fractions of a second that universal positive engagement is the norm, or if they assume—as they anticipate the *Turn and Talk* coming—that

---

<!-- Page 631 -->

everyone will naturally participate with interest and enthusiasm, then you get the kind of crackling energy you see in Christine’s, BreOnna’s, Sarah’s, Denarius’s, and Sadie's classrooms.

It's critical that *Turn and Talk* become a familiar and well-rehearsed procedure, in other words, and it's critical that it be launched with an in-cue that is both a direction—here is what to do—and signal to start and so should be short, crisp, and clear. You need just enough words to clarify the question and the task; beyond that, keeping the in-cue short and punchy creates energy.

It's no coincidence then that the in-cues we see are so similar.

The recipe is **Frame. Name. [Time]. Go!** in almost every case. Teachers frame the question clearly, then identify that the task is a *Turn and Talk*, and then (sometimes) set a time context. Then they give a consistent signal to start. That the signal is so often “Go!” is no surprise, given the goal of building an immediately visible norm of positive engagement.

It's worth lingering for a moment on the first step, framing the question. Once a strong procedure has been installed (see [techniques 49] and [50] in particular for guidance on this critical step), the framing is the trickiest part. It's very hard to jump into a discussion with energy and verve if you're not clear on the question or what it means. And this means, for teachers, the question for discussion should be carefully phrased and quite possibly drafted in advance. Sometimes you will use one reactively in the moment—“Hmm. We're a little divided on the answer. Turn and discuss with your partner...”—but for the most part teachers like the ones we've watched have likely drafted their *Turn and Talks* in their notes. You can see an example of how Christine prepares this part of her lesson in [Chapter Two].

---

<!-- Page 632 -->

It's worth noting, too, that there might be cases in which you'd want to vary your cadence, tone, and inflection when framing a question. For example, if I thought the question was especially challenging and thoughtful and wanted students to think carefully as or before they began to *Turn and Talk*, I might give my directions with a slower cadence and a reflective tone. I watched Rue Ratray (then of Edward Brooke Charter School in Boston) do this masterfully in one of his lessons recently. Students were reading an interview with Lois Lowry about her novel *The Giver*; and came upon a sentence that required close reading. “I agree with Nijah,” Rue said. “We do need to break down the phrase ‘Rejecting the authority and wisdom of the governing body.’ What does that mean?” he asked. He spoke slowly and tilted his head slightly in apparent befuddlement. He paused for a few seconds to let the question sink in. Then: “*Turn and Talk* to your partner. Go!” As he said this the class came to life. The phrase Rue used, “*Turn and Talk* to your partner. Go!” was central to this success. It was familiar because he'd been using it steadily for weeks as he dispatched them to *Turn and Talks*. But here he combined it with a bit of *Wait Time* beforehand … four or five seconds to begin reflecting before they spoke. Denarius Frazier, too, uses a long stretch of *Wait Time* before his crisp cue to *Turn and Talk* at the beginning of his Keystone to set a cerebral and reflective tone.

If the transition into *Turn and Talk* is crisp and the routine familiar, you can cue up a *Turn and Talk* on the spur of the moment. Notice how the *Turn and Talk* unfolds in the video *Alonte Johnson: Mother's Courage* during Alonte's lesson on on Edna St. Vincent Millay's poem “The Courage That My Mother Had.” Alonte's *Turn and Talk* is unplanned—a reaction to the small number of hands he sees when he asks his question. He thinks—Ah! They're reticent. I'll let them talk it out to build their ideas and their confidence.

---

<!-- Page 633 -->

He even shares that intention with them at the end: “Glad to see so many more hands....” Only when the routine is seamless and clear can you drop it in impromptu like this. But if you can it's an ideal tool for responding to crickets.

## Managing Turns and Listening Behaviors

A quick, consistent *Turn and Talk* in-cue helps foster energetic discussion among all students. But to return to one of the themes of this chapter, the value of the discussion that comes after relies as much on the quality of the listening as it does on the quality of the talking, so it's worth taking a moment to consider some of the ways teachers can build and reinforce listening behaviors during *Turn and Talk*.

One of my favorites is the occasional use of managed turns—intentionally cueing one partner or the other to start first. This is valuable because we can make two important assumptions about most *Turn and Talks*. First, the talking within them won't be split evenly. Sometimes the first person to talk will talk through the whole *Turn and Talk*. This can be for legitimate reasons—the *Turn and Talk* is short, and it takes a while to make a point, or they're caught up in an idea. Second, we can assume that some students are more inclined to talk than others. They are likely to interpret the phrase “*Turn and Talk* to your partner, go!” as a cue to start talking themselves. Others are more reserved by nature. They are likely to interpret the phrase “*Turn and Talk* to your partner, go!” as a cue to glance at their partner and encourage them to start talking. Not always, of course, but there are tendencies, stronger or weaker, among specific students. If we pair them neutrally, those who tend to talk more will talk more—when perhaps it would be more beneficial for them to practice listening—and those who are quieter will be more inclined to listen—

---

<!-- Page 634 -->

when perhaps it would be good for them to talk a little more.

Eric Snider of Achievement First Bushwick Middle School used the idea of managed turns to address that in a recent lesson. His class was reading Ray Bradbury. During a tense scene, Eric looked at his students. “What is David, the son, feeling worried about?” Pausing briefly, he added, “Long hair to short hair.” That phrase was their prompt to *Turn and Talk*. It meant that the member of each pair with longer hair would start the conversation. Other times when Eric used the in-cue, he would say, “Short hair to long hair,”⁵ to reverse whose turn came first and ensure balance in participation. Other times, of course, he would not specify who began and would leave it to students instead. The idea is to occasionally increase voice equity by balancing the talking and listening roles.

A related tool that can balance voice equity during *Turn and Talks* is to insert an intentional switch point. For instance, “We're halfway through your ninety seconds. Please be sure switch partners if you haven't already.”

Another useful tool for socializing listening in *Turn and Talks* is to ask students to refer to their partner's idea when calling on them afterwards, as in: “Rodrigo, what did you and Kelsey talk about?” Or, after Rodrigo says, “I think the reaction is going to give off heat energy,” asking, “Did Kelsey agree?” Or, on occasions when students spontaneously mention their partners’ thinking—“We weren't sure but Kelsey thought it would be exothermic”—saying “Thank you for referencing your partner's ideas.”

You could also be more meta: “I'd love to hear from some class members whose partner shared a particularly useful example during the *Turn and Talk*.” Or “I'd like to start with someone whose partner said something surprising.” Letting students know that we notice and care when they

---

<!-- Page 635 -->

show they value their partner's contributions is one way to get them to do more of it.

“In questioning after a *Turn and Talk*, I ask about the conversations,” Bill Wilkinson, deputy head of science at Beechen Cliff School, in Bath, England, noted. He suggests asking such questions as: (1) Which pairs disagreed on the answer at first? (2) Which pairs agreed by the end? (3) Which of you changed your mind? Tell us why. (4) Don't tell me what you thought, tell me what your partner thought.

## The Accountability Challenge

Here are some tools that can help to ensure that your *Turn and Talks* are accountable and focused—that is, that students feel gentle pressure to do their best work and stay on task.

Use *Cold Call* (technique 34) to set the expectation that everyone should be ready to talk about some insight he or she gleaned after the *Turn and Talk* is complete. Have a positive tone and make sure you sound genuinely interested: *Magalie, tell us a bit about what you and Donald spoke about...* If this is relatively predictable, students will know they have to be ready to summarize their conversation. You can often make this likelihood of a *Cold Call* more transparent by letting students know beforehand that it’s likely to occur: “One minute to discuss the imagery you noticed with your partner. I may *Cold Call* a few of you to share, so be ready with what you and your partner discussed. Go!”

Circulating during the *Turn and Talk* and listening in on conversations gives you a double bonus—it allows you to show appreciation for and interest in good work and tacitly ensure students are focused and productive. You can see in the following pictures of Christine Torres, Sarah Wright, and BreOnna Tindall how they use body language and

---

<!-- Page 636 -->

posture to show their interest in what they hear students say as they circulate. In some cases they are actually responding verbally. In others they are merely listening and showing how much they appreciate top effort.

Turn and Task. You can also turn your Turn and Talk into a Turn and Task. You can see a great example of this in the video Gabby Woolf: Keystone. After a round of FASE Reading (technique 24) with her class, Gabby assigns students to read the next section of text to one another in pairs. It's partner work but the work they do together is something other than discussion. That might mean saying: “With your partner, come up with a list of three words to describe the setting,” or “With your partner, write a hypothesis describing the results you think you might see from the experiment.” “With your partner, solve problem 4. I'll Cold Call some of you to hear your answers. Go!” Having a clear deliverable emphasizes accountability a bit more because the task is clearer. If it's a written task, it serves this purpose even better: you can observe the writing as you circulate. You can ask students to “share what you wrote.” You can even collect the work to review it later.

One small lesson for teachers from the year 2020 and online instruction comes from doing Turn and Talks online via breakout rooms. The most common reason why pairs are off task in an online breakout room is that students

---

<!-- Page 637 -->

can't remember or are not clear on the question! So making sure that the question is absolutely clear—and possibly even written down somewhere if the *Turn and Talk* is more than a minute in length—can help remind people of what they are supposed to be discussing.^6

A final note on accountability and focus. Students engage fully in *Turn and Talks* in large part because it is their habit to do so. We want to avoid letting them get into the habit of sitting looking at each other during a *Turn and Talk* because they have little to say. In fact we want to avoid their even having that experience. We want them to assume the conversation will be active and useful. One reason why students might have experiences with disengaged and passive *Turn and Talks* is because otherwise productive *Turn and Talks* went on too long and resulted in awkward moments when they and their partners were all talked out. That’s my first topic in the next section, but it’s worth noting that keeping *Turn and Talks* short also plays a role in keeping students engaged.

## Design and Sequence for Rigor

Recently I watched a lesson from a middle school science class. The topic of the lesson was friction. The class had read an article on how friction might affect the movements of a basketball during a game, and the teacher asked his students to *Turn and Talk* to discuss what they’d learned. The teacher’s in-cue was crisp, and he had established a culture of positive accountability, so students buzzed into action, sharing their energy, their excitement, and, as it turned out afterwards, a great deal of misinformation.

When the teacher asked students to share the ideas they’d discussed in pairs, the first three out of four shared ideas that misapplied or misunderstood how friction worked. Almost everyone, the data was telling him, had shared and

---

<!-- Page 638 -->

believed misreadings about the article. Suddenly, he had some mopping up to do.

There are times, this story reminds us, when even with efficient and accountable systems, *Turn and Talks* can be dominated by the spread of low-quality ideas—or erroneous ones. In the class I watched, the teacher stumbled on this fact through the good fortune of hearing answers that revealed the problems, and the wise decision to process the *Turn and Talk* through a broader, teacher-led discussion afterwards. But let’s pause here to consider all of the *Turn and Talks* where misinformation has blithely and earnestly been spread among participating students who did not know that what they were hearing (or saying and driving into memory) was dead wrong, all without the teacher being aware of it. As Graham Nuttall points out in *The Hidden Lives of Learners*, peer-generated misinformation can be profoundly influential on student thinking.

A *Turn and Talk* by itself is a great tool for boosting Participation Ratio, then. It multiplies voices and gets everyone going by giving them a low-stakes way to share ideas, rehearse a larger thought, develop their first impression, or hear an alternative reaction, all in semi-private, where saying, “Whoops, actually that was a really bad idea!” is fine. But *Turn and Talk* can also involve students sharing ideas that need development and clarification. It can involve the spreading of misinformation and confirmation bias. It can generate thinking that requires more reflection and direction.

Perhaps the most useful way to think about *Turn and Talk* is as a rehearsal for some other activity: a whole-class discussion, a written synthesis, a charting and comparison of ideas generated. The *Turn and Talk*’s purpose is generative—let’s get a lot of ideas going, figure out what makes sense, and why. After a *Turn and Talk*, the ideas that

---

<!-- Page 639 -->

were generated get analyzed, studied, clarified, and confirmed—maybe even edited, revised, and prioritized—in a public way, so that students see what was good, what was better, and possibly what was wrong.

Here, then, are three key “after” activities to make sure that *Turn and Talk* brings rigor and high standards to your classroom.

## Whole-Class Analysis

Teach students that the first idea is not always the best idea, that developing a strong answer often requires going back through your initial thoughts and considering them in light of further criteria or analysis. This might sound like “Let's look at some of the ideas we came up with and see which ones make the most sense,” or “Let's try to use what we know about friction to test a few of our ideas and see if they were accurate.” Or you could try something like “Let's put a couple of these on the board and list the evidence that seems to support (or not support) some of our ideas.”

## Whole-Class Discussion

Use *Turn and Talk* as the starting point for a deeper whole-class discussion that builds on and stretches students' initial thinking. This might sound like “Let's build on the thinking we've started,” possibly with a coda, like “As we talk, feel free to add to what you already wrote down.” Or you might try “Now let's try to put our ideas together to come up with a few ‘best’ examples.” Or, finally, you could just acknowledge that the initial *Turn and Talk* was a warm-up: “Now that we've started to discuss some ideas, let's take a look at the sentence together and see if we can make sense of what it means.”

## Whole-Class Note-Taking

---

<!-- Page 640 -->

Follow up the *Turn and Talk* by processing those initial thoughts—by having students share, improve, and prioritize the contents of their collective “pair” discussions. The expectation here is that they take what they talked about in their *Turn and Talk*, develop it by listening and comparing to what others took from the discussion, and track a wide array of thoughts on the topic, not just their own. This might sound like “Add two sentences to the bullets on page three” or “Now let’s look at the passage and circle all the evidence we found as a group. Make sure to take notes on your sheet so you’ve got all of our class’s ideas in your notes.”

## What Comes First?

Another way to build more Think Ratio into your *Turn and Talk* is to add an activity before it occurs that boosts ratio. Letting students write first is the most obvious. We can see the effects of this in BreOnna Tindall’s classroom. What students are discussing in pairs is not their spur-of-the-moment reaction but something they’ve been wrestling into words for several minutes. The Think Ratio is higher. As I discuss in the chapter on writing for ratio, writing first helps any discussion—even a pair conversation. It adds rigor and allows people to listen better.

Think time prior to a *Turn and Talk* can also help. It’s simple and fast and provides some of the benefit you get from allowing students to write first. That’s what Rue Ratray was doing when he posed his question to his students about *The Giver*—“We do need to break down the phrase ‘Rejecting the authority and wisdom of the governing body.’ What does *that* mean?” As you’ll recall he paused for four or five seconds before sending students to a *Turn and Talk*. Letting them reflect and generate initial

---

<!-- Page 641 -->

ideas. You could easily stretch out this think time and make it more transparent

T: “We do need to break down the phrase ‘Rejecting the authority and wisdom of the governing body.’ What does *that* mean? Take ten seconds to think about what that phrase means before I let you talk to a partner about it. [Ten seconds elapses] OK. Share your thoughts with your partner. Go!”

Or

T: “We do need to break down the phrase ‘Rejecting the authority and wisdom of the governing body.’ What does *that* mean? Take fifteen seconds to jot down some ideas. What does that phrase mean? Then I’ll let you talk to a partner about it. [Fifteen seconds elapses] OK. Share your thoughts with your partner. Go!”

In these two examples, you would make the *Turn and Talk* even better by making sure the question was jotted on the whiteboard or student packet, and thus helping students to remember the question once the conversation actually begins.

Inserting a *Turn and Talk* when you’re stuck can also be a useful tool. Here you’re not so much planning a preliminary activity as spotting a place where the Think Ratio is high and some more active thinking would help. That’s what Alonte Johnson and Denarius Frazier are doing with their impromptu *Turn and Talks*. The moment when students are stuck is a great time to let them “think it out” in pairs.

## Priming

A final thought on building more rigor into *Turn and Talks*: In addition to a clear question, a time frame and a cue to begin, your *Turn and Talk* directions can also prompt

students to use or discuss specific key ideas. For example:

> “Take forty-five seconds to discuss what's happening with your partner. Strive to use the words ‘spindle fibers.’ I'll put it up on the board to help you remember. If your partner doesn't use that phrase, ask them to restate using the key term, as we will be using it when we share out after your conversations.”

## Crest of the Wave and Precise Time Limits

Two general rules of thumb can help you to manage time (and timing) during *Turn and Talks*. The first, *crest of the wave*, relates to the observation that a *Turn and Talk* is almost always a preliminary activity. It's rarely the capstone to work on a topic, but rather a midpoint where ideas are rehearsed and developed before they are harvested, refined, and developed. If you are transitioning from a *Turn and Talk* to an activity that allows for better synthesis, you want students to still be actively wrestling with ideas and eager to take them forward, rather than feeling “done” with an idea as the *Turn and Talk* ends. If it goes on too long and students have talked through all of their ideas, running out of things to say as the clock keeps ticking, this will sap energy and cause students to perceive *Turn and Talk* as an activity in which there's not much urgency to discuss things because there's likely to be dead time to fill. This perception will likely infect behavior in all *Turn and Talks*.

If you were to graph the level of energy during a *Turn and Talk*, it might look like a normal curve with a fat tail at the end. Ideally you would end it at its maximum point, when ideas were bursting and students eager to get to the next steps, before the long slope downward. That's the crest of the wave (see Figure 9.1).

## Precise, Clear Time Limits

---

<!-- Page 643 -->

Another general rule is to be precise with time. Imagine you're a student and are participating in a *Turn and Talk*, but you don't know how long it's going to last. Forty-five seconds? Two minutes? Fifteen minutes? Not knowing this basic information can make it hard for you to gauge how much to say. Do you need to get the basic idea out and stop so that the other person can broach an idea? Is your conversation about deep analysis? Should you ask your partner a thoughtful question? Informing participants of the time parameters helps them manage their comments and their conversations to make the best use of time. Saying “*Turn and Talk* to your neighbor for the next thirty seconds” means just share some initial ideas. Be quick and then let the other person talk. Saying “Two-and-a-half minutes to discuss the role of setting. Go!” provides guidance; further, your use of specific and odd increments shows that your time allocation is careful, specific, and intentional. It tells students that time and its careful use matter to you, so they should matter to them. If you use a stopwatch to track those time allocations, it also helps you keep yourself accountable for moving the lesson forward and not losing track of time while checking in with a stuck or highly engaged pair, for example. And, over time, it will help you make smarter and more specific time allocations for *Turn and Talks*.

**Online Lessons: Remote *Turn and Talks***

*Turn and Talks* were critical to engagement during remote teaching. They allowed us to boost the ratio and let often isolated students talk to one another. But online *Turn and Talks*—breakout rooms in pairs—were also doubly challenging. The video *Ben Esser: Shorter Turn and Talk* shows how Ben solved many of these challenges. Students have written answers first, so this *Turn and Talk* is an opportunity to rehearse and explain ideas. Perhaps for that reason the time allocation is short, and Ben emphasizes this fact by telling students it will be short. He wants them to come out ready to talk to the whole group. Being clear about time helps students gauge how long to talk and making sure they have plenty to say helps overcome some potential awkwardness of being in a breakout room without much to say. You can also see that he's managing turns here—the person with the name that comes first in the alphabet goes first. He also addresses the possibility of students being off task by dropping into a few pairs conversations. In fact, Ben *Cold Calls* Suraya to speak because he dropped into her group and thought she had a strong idea. She most likely knows this and sees the *Cold Call* as an approval of her thinking.

**TECHNIQUE 44: HABITS OF DISCUSSION**

Imagine for a moment that we're sitting with a group of people. You say, “I just finished *The Giver*. It's so good and psychologically jarring.”

---

<!-- Page 646 -->

I say, “I’m almost done with *The Hunger Games*. It’s so violent but still pretty good.”

Then our friend Corinne joins in. “I just couldn’t get into *The Hunger Games*,” she says.

This series of comments does not quite qualify as a discussion—at least not in the fullest sense. Instead, it exemplifies what’s often missing when we call disconnected verbal interactions a “discussion.” Was my comment, “I’m almost done with *The Hunger Games*,” a response to your comment about *The Giver*, for example? Did I say that because they are both dystopian novels and I see some connection? Did I hear your point about it being psychologically jarring? Am I comparing that to the violence of *Hunger Games*? Am I just using the opportunity to talk about a book that I like instead of one that you like? Am I trying to talk about *The Giver* or changing the subject? If I’d said something like, “I hear you about *The Giver*. Someone told me *The Hunger Games* would be similar but it’s not as good to me. Maybe because it’s so violent,” I would be connecting my comment to yours and making it clear how they were related. And I would be making it clear that I had listened carefully to what you said.

Corinne’s comment was similar. When she said, “I couldn’t get into *The Hunger Games*,” was she changing the subject due to her inability to finish books? Excusing herself from the conversation on the grounds that she hadn’t read the book? Or was she saying she had stopped reading *The Hunger Games* because it was so violent? Was she following up on my comment? Did she hear it? A bit of framing—“Funny the violence didn’t bother me but I couldn’t get into *The Hunger Games*. It just wasn’t as well written as *The Giver*”—could have helped us to see those connections and knit our comments together. She was in

<!-- Page 647 -->

fact comparing the books we’d both mentioned and showing that she was thinking about the connection.

We all could have connected our ideas and demonstrated that we were listening, but we didn’t. Our comments were related, but not really a discussion so much as a series of statements loosely grouped around an idea.

Conversations in the classroom are often similar. A discussion is supposed to be a *mutual endeavor* by a group of people to *develop, refine, or contextualize an idea or set of ideas*, and that’s different from a series of loosely related comments. What characterizes discussion in the most successful classrooms is a commitment to connecting and relating ideas and opinions. A discussion that’s valuable will feature comments that are consistently useful to others, not just interesting to those who made them, and which establish the speaker’s understanding of and interest in what was previously said.

People who make a conversation effective *show* they are listening carefully by occasionally offering brief summaries of other participants’ comments or by making a specific effort to connect the point they’re making to what someone else said. A comment that refers back to earlier ideas and strives for that connection makes for a discussion—for example, saying “Funny, the violence didn’t bother me” both clarifies the argument and shows appreciation for what other conversants have said. And it makes us feel like we belong and have things to contribute. It convinces us to share more, and perhaps to believe ourselves to be a little more capable.

Generally, of course, people don’t consciously think, *I’ll make it clear I’m building off someone else’s point or I’ll reinforce that I value the person I’m talking to right now even though I disagree*. Most positive discussion-building actions are habits triggered by a conversant’s intuitive

---

<!-- Page 648 -->

sense of how discussion should work—a mental model. So if a teacher can instill strong conversational habits and an effective mental model, she will help students quite naturally build discussions that are connected, in which participants show appreciation for one another.

Cultures that express appreciation during discussion and especially when there is disagreement are important for more reasons than cordiality. Jonathan Haidt explains in his book *The Righteous Mind* that people are much more likely to change their opinion when they like the person they are talking to and know he or she likes and cares about them. Ideas that change us come from people we perceive as allies. We like and trust them first; then we listen with openness. This is especially true when we already believe something. Someone who confronts us almost never changes an established belief; only someone we *want* to believe does that, Haidt finds. So when mutual respect and psychological safety pervade, and where the ethos is collaborative, and the message is *We are working together to understand this*, then, true open-mindedness and maximum learning are likely to occur.

In most cases, good discussion skills, those that allow certain people to bring out the best in their colleagues, are not “naturally occurring.” Especially not today, when abrasive models of conversation are so commonly normalized on social media. To reliably have great discussions in your classroom, it’s necessary to instill such behaviors deliberately. Doing so is a technique I call *Habits of Discussion*, and it’s a powerful tool. The return on the investment in teaching students how to discuss is immense.

The first step in building strong *Habits of Discussion* is a series of nearly invisible behaviors displayed by participants in a conversation that signal the importance of the endeavor and remind other participants of their

---

<!-- Page 649 -->

belonging in a community that values them. These include things like establishing and maintaining eye contact and engaging frequently in *prosocial nonverbal behaviors*, such as nodding to show understanding and others I described in the critical technique *Habits of Attention*. “A small signal can have a huge effect on people's sense of belonging and membership,” social psychologist Gregory Walton tells Daniel Coyle in *The Culture Code*. “But the deeper thing to realize is that you can't just give the cue once.” It has to occur frequently and steadily.

The fundamental actions participants take to build a strong discussion are listening carefully and showing speakers they care about what they're saying. No one makes a discussion-changing insight to a room full of people whose body language says *I don't care*. Maintaining eye contact not only helps communicate both ideas but helps students discipline themselves to “lock in” on the person they're listening to and helps them “hear more.” By looking at the person talking, a listener picks up gestures and facial expressions that add meaning to the words themselves.

An additional fundamental comes from the technique *Format Matters*. Students have to speak loudly enough to be heard clearly. This works best when it is a habit. Nothing breaks the thread of a discussion like the teacher saying, “Carly, we can't hear you,” or, worse, the situation going uncorrected. *It’s fine if we can’t hear you* makes a pretty clear statement about the importance afforded to Carly's thoughts. Not only can people not respond to what they can't hear, but when people are straining to hear, their facial expressions and body language change. You cannot make a what-you-are-saying-is-interesting face when you are making an I-can-barely-hear-you one.

To the importance of eye contact, listening behaviors, and reinforcing voice volume, we can add three specific

---

<!-- Page 650 -->

additional fundamentals: names, reciprocal looking, and rephrasing.

Consider this moment from a discussion in an eighth-grade classroom about Lincoln's inaugural address.

“I think Lincoln looked weak and maybe conflicted in extending an ‘olive branch’ to the Southern states,” Jabari says.

“No,” Jamila counters, “He says he will enforce federal laws in states that secede. He's drawing a clear line in the sand but trying not to seem like he's provoking conflict.”

Jamila is looking at the teacher as she says this, implying that the teacher is the person whose opinion matters most. Jabari, and the fact that the argument she is responding to is his, is just not that relevant to Jamila.

Now imagine the scene slightly differently. Michelle turns to Jabari. “Jabari,” she says, “I don't read Lincoln's words as ‘conflicted.’ He says he will enforce federal laws in states that secede. He's drawing a clear line in the sand but trying not to seem like he's provoking conflict.”

In looking at Jabari, in using his name in the response and implicitly summarizing his point and using his exact words —“I don't read Lincoln's words as conflicted”—Michelle has emphasized the fact that she is responding to him directly. Her actions say, I listened carefully to your argument; I understood and respect it. Alex Pentland, who leads the program on Connection Studies at MIT, notes that studies on team performance have found that cultures where “members communicate directly with one another ... not just the team leader”7 tend to be the most successful and collaborative learning environments.

Reciprocally looking at Jabari—looking back at him to show she is responding to him—rephrasing his argument and using his name all build the fabric of support and

connection. They reinforce a sense of community in the classroom throughout the discussion.

Perhaps this is why I often see positive outlier teachers reinforce this expectation in class, either verbally—“Great; turn to Janelle and tell her that”—or nonverbally, with a brief point of the finger or eyes reminding students to look at the person they're responding to. They're reminding their students of how important it is for people who intend to discuss an idea to talk to each other.

Now let's upgrade Michelle's response even a little more. If Michelle said, “I read that passage differently, Jabari. I don't read Lincoln's words as ‘conflicted,’” her words “I read that passage a little differently” show that she is relating her argument to his. *I agree that these are important words; here's a different way to think about them.* Making the effort to frame the connection shows that she thinks Jabari's comment was important. Participants who, like Michelle, tacitly reference preceding comments via syntactical structures embedded within the grammar of their sentences, make them important. Some typical phrases that do that include:

- “I understand why you'd say that, but ...”
- “I was just thinking of something similar, that ...”
- “And then there was another example of that ...”
- “The thing that doesn't take into account is ...”
- “I want to build on what you said ...”

In each of these examples—whether the new speaker is agreeing with the first speaker, disagreeing with her, or somewhere in between—the comment begins by framing the relationship between the present comment and the previous one, ideally in some respectful way. Teaching

---

<!-- Page 652 -->

students to use frames like this to weave their comments together with those around them results in more cohesive discussions. It is usually accomplished through the use of sentence starters—short phrases that teachers socialize students to use and adapt, that facilitate building off someone else's idea.

Many teachers start by posting sentence starters like these on their wall and spending a few days asking students to practice using basic ones, saying things like, “Great; can you use a sentence starter to frame that response and talk directly to Aleisha?” or “Today I'm just going to listen for how well you use our sentence starters to build off one another during our discussion.” Or, as BreOnna Tindall described, praising effective use of them, “Oh, you built on that idea so well. That was so good!” Over time, the list itself would become less critical as using the sentence starters and adaptations of them become a habit.

The simplest sentence starters are “I agree because …” or “I disagree because …” These are useful, especially, for getting students started in responding to one another and situating their comments within the larger conversation, but as many of the teachers I know have developed their use of sentence starters over time, they've pushed to get beyond “agree” or “disagree” pretty quickly. But sentence starters don't just reflect how students think during discussions; they shape it, too—in this case tending to socialize students to take sides, to focus on “winning” the discussion, to dig in their heels and try to prove their original comment was right. The best discussions are less about proving oneself right than they are about finding nuanced common ground. Agree/disagree is an acceptable starting point but students can and should think in more complex ways. So it’s important to introduce students to sentence starters that push them to find other ways of connecting their arguments' to others:

---

<!-- Page 653 -->

- “There's another piece of evidence to think about ...”
- “There's some evidence that makes me not sure what to think ...”
- “I'd like to build on ______'s idea ...”
- “I think there are two ways of reading that ...”
- “There's another example of what ______ is talking about ...”
- “Another way you might interpret that is ...”
- “I think it's more complex than what we've been saying because ...”

Nonverbals, too, can be critical to building up the habit of using sentence starters. Maggie Johnson, a reading teacher at Troy Prep Middle School, developed different hand signals that her students used when they wanted to develop someone else's idea as opposed to making a new comment. When they want to make a new point during a discussion, they raise their hand in the usual fashion. When they want to “add on,” develop, or respond to the previous point, they raise two fingers. This allows Maggie to shape the direction of the discussion even without participating in it. She can decide whether it's more valuable to stick with the present point or move on to a new one, and she can move in that direction merely by choosing whom she calls on to go next. In fact, keeping a discussion focused on a point of importance or value is one of the most important things for a teacher to attend to during discussion, a topic I will discuss in technique 46, *Disciplined Discussion*.

A last element of *Habits of Discussion* is the addition of teaching moves that cause students to build the habit—and ideally a mental model—of one speaker building off the previous. Follow-on questioning—an adaptation of the “follow-on” from the *Cold Call* (technique 34)—and follow-

---

<!-- Page 654 -->

on prompting can help. In a follow-on, the teacher consistently asks one student to respond to something another student has said, whether or not the second student has volunteered to do so. Something as simple as, “Skylar, do you agree with Markus?” (asked in good faith and not as a “gotcha”; see *Cold Call* for more details) establishes the expectation that Skylar must always be listening well enough to be able to offer a reasonable response, even if only to say that he's not sure about a particular point. Expecting Skylar to be able to respond reinforces peer-to-peer listening and, importantly, reinforces that listening is an expectation no matter who is speaking—it is a courtesy not merely reserved for the teacher. Of course to build the habit of follow-on in discussion you could use it without the *Cold Call*. Skylar might have raised his hand and instead of simply calling on him by saying his name you might remind him of the expectation that he develop the previous comment by saying, “Skylar, what do you think of what Markus just said?”

Instead of asking a directive question like, “Skylar, do you agree with Markus?” follow-on prompting is nondirective, with the result that it disrupts the thread of the conversation less and avoids steering the second student's response, which in some cases is part of the purpose of discussion. A teacher who's using follow-on prompting might keep his students on their toes and listening to one another by using fast follow-on prompts five or six times per class—enough to be predictably unpredictable without breaking the flow of students responding directly to one another via *Cold Call*.

You can see Christine Torres doing this in the second half of her Keystone video. She asks students to opine on whether Kirsty is brave when she talks back to Nazi soldiers in a key scene of *Number the Stars*.

---

<!-- Page 655 -->

Mark says yes: She's young and vulnerable and brave in speaking up to those in power.

“Build on, Jasmine …” Christine says. This prompt reminds Jasmine to refer back to Mark's answer and contextualize her remarks accordingly. Like saying *develop* or *weigh in* or *say more*, *build on* reminds a student to both refer back to the previous comment and stay on the topic at hand, but unlike the more commonly used *agree or disagree* (or *do you agree?*) it also allows for a wider array of possible responses. Encouraging students to agree/disagree focuses them on who’s right rather than more nuanced forms of thinking. It narrows the range of potential responses.

In this case Jasmine chooses a relatively straightforward connection between her comment and Mark's: “I agree with you, Mark,” she says, “and I'd like to build on to it …” She's connected directly to Mark to show it's a discussion and indicated how her comment is related. She will be describing further evidence of Kirsty's bravery.

Next to be called on is Nate. “What do you think, Nate?” Christine says. It's a subtle reminder to situate his remark relative to Mark and Jasmine's comments.

“I respectfully disagree with you, Mark and Jasmine,” Nate begins.

Through this approach, prompts like *develop* allow Christine to remind her students to practice responding to one another with little intervention from her.

There's a certain amount of sophistication and maturity evident in a class that uses *Habits of Discussion*, but the technique is effective even with younger students. For example, Anthony in Akilah Bond's Keystone video responds to Cheyenne about halfway through by saying, “I kind of agree with you, Cheyenne,” and Michael begins to add, “What we're missing from Sonoa's response is …”

<!-- Page 656 -->

**TECHNIQUE 45: BATCH PROCESS**

You can see some of the elements of strong *Habits of Discussion* and other elements from this book in the video *Jason Brewer: Batch Process*. Discussing changes in labor brought about by the early stages of industrialization in the United States, student are attentive and supportive of one another. Their prosocial listening behaviors and tracking (see *Habits of Attention*, [technique 48](#)) are strong. It feels like the kind of classroom where you can have a substantive conversation in a supportive environment.  
You'll probably also notice Jason's outstanding *Wait Time* ([technique 33](#)) before he calls on his first student, Mahaira. Her answer is wrong, but her classmates remain supportive and respectful and Jason manages his tell (see [technique 12](#), *Culture of Error*) beautifully. He merely says, “Agree or disagree? ... Nyesha ...” It's a textbook follow-on prompt, reminding Nyesha to ground her comment in Mahaira's.  

“I respectfully disagree with you, Mahaira,” Nyesha begins, proceeding to point out how the rise of replaceable parts required less skill from laborers, allowing factory owners to replace them as they wished. She speaks directly to Mahaira and refers back to her classmate’s answer gracefully.  

Jason then calls on a third student, “Marty, what do you think?” reminding him to sustain focus on the present topic with a follow-on prompt that gives wide latitude and opens the opportunity for him to incorporate his classmate's comments into his own reflections.  

It's a short discussion but a productive one. Jason says almost nothing about the content of the conversation in the spaces between his three students’ comments except to call on the next speaker and gently remind them of discussion norms. He doesn't say, “That's right, would anyone like to

---

<!-- Page 657 -->

build off of Nyesha's idea?” or “Marty has made an important point!” or “Almost, Mahaira, but I think you’ve left something out.” Only at the end after three comments from students does he step in, asking the class questions about a hypothetical example in which Drayvon works in a factory and asks for more pay.

In addition to socializing strong *Habits of Discussion*, Jason is *Batch Processing*, establishing very short sequences in which students have mini peer-to-peer discussions even within other lesson activities, such as direct instruction or questioning (see [Chapter 6]()). Jason doesn’t have to stop class and announce: “OK, we’ll have a discussion now.” Merely by letting three students have turns directly in a row and not taking a turn himself until the end, he allows a mini-discussion to emerge naturally. He speaks only after three students have offered their commentary rather than responding to each individually. Rather than playing tennis (comments going student-teacher-student-teacher-student-teacher) in Jason’s class, they play volleyball: the comments go student-student-student-teacher.

You can see another example in the video *Josh Sullivan: Say More About That*. As they respond to his question, Josh chooses to let three students speak in a row without comment from him. Or at least without verbal comment. His expression and gestures and the notes he silently writes on the board show that he is listening and that ideas of merit are emerging as students speak. In an environment where strong norms like *Habits of Attention*, *Habits of Discussion*, and of course volunteering through hand-raising are in place, this can facilitate short bursts of student-to-student discourse in the midst of other activities.

Obviously the key is to resist mediating every comment and allow short strings of three or four students to speak in a row. (Then you can step in to comment and steer.) But it’s

---

<!-- Page 658 -->

also important to model thoughtful, attentive listening. Not only does this reinforce the importance of student comments, but it helps you resist talking since much of what we say between comments is designed to show the sort of interest and approval we can often express without words. I personally prefer saying students' names rather than just pointing at speakers and it's also sometimes useful to add low-transaction-cost reminders of established discussion norms, such as, “Build on that, Henry.” It's still *Batch Processing* if you speak between student comments as long as what you say is merely to manage the process (i.e. choose who's next) as opposed to commenting on ideas. And of course it can still be beneficial for the teacher to comment on ideas offered during *Batch Processing*—you just have to wait a bit so students get to talk to each other first.

Another benefit of *Batch Processing* is that it meshes perfectly with our understanding of deliberate practice. Short iterations of spaced practice will build a skill more completely than larger but less frequent doses. Do something a little bit every day—for two minutes, say—and you'll get better at it than if you do it twice a month in a larger block—forty minutes, say. In one school we worked closely with, where students were especially adept at discussion, the key to transformation was the principal's request that all teachers take one minute during every lesson to practice the fundamentals of peer-to-peer discussion. That small amount of daily practice turned out to be more productive and easier to orchestrate than the more elaborate forms of discussions that required fifteen hypothetical minutes everyone was hoping would still be there at the end of a lesson.

History teacher Ryan Miller used this approach for student-to-student discussion at Williamsburg Collegiate Charter School in Brooklyn. In every lesson, Ryan asked what he

---

<!-- Page 659 -->

thought would be a challenging and interesting question, set a clock for two minutes, and then stepped back and let students talk and respond directly to one another with little mediation or intervention from him except to identify the next speaker. He found two minutes to be plenty of time, and transparently using a timer brought out the best ideas—students had to make valuable contributions, not fill time—without letting things go on for too long. Suddenly he could drop into a two-minute discussion at any point: *Let's pause as Kennedy and his cabinet are planning their response to the missiles and put two minutes on the clock. What were some alternative actions they could have considered?*

Some other points Ryan made about his daily *Batch Process*: he's always disciplined about making the conversation connect to the central idea of the lesson. And he trained his students carefully on *Habits of Discussion* so they were effective at responding to building off each other's ideas. Ryan would step in to guide students in staying on task and avoiding off-task comments, straying from the topic, or not developing the previous idea. Those actions are part of the final technique in this chapter, *Disciplined Discussion*.

My colleague Hannah Solomon, who has made a habit of running schools characterized by rigor and joy, offered some suggestions to consider if you choose to try this idea:

- Student preparation is critical for this to succeed—kids need to be clear on the question, have ample processing time (preferably in writing, so teachers can use *Cold Call* to stir the pot if the conversation slows), and have received support in how to respond to each other (i.e. *Habits of Discussion*) before the teacher sets the timer and sits back.

---

<!-- Page 660 -->

- Teachers need to choose intentionally whether or not to summarize key takeaways at the end of the two minutes—either by clarifying misconceptions or by stating something like, “Let's keep wrestling with this challenge as we move forward.”

- Teachers should be transparent about the *Means of Participation*—is it all volunteers or some *Cold Calls* or some other model?

- One challenge with techniques similar to this in younger grades is that so much misinformation can get shared that teachers then need to tidy up after—so the role of knowledge feeding is important to consider. This is an activity that works much better when everyone has learned a lot and has strong background knowledge.

# Charting Aids Discussion by Aiding Memory

One way to help students stay on topic and validate their classmates' ideas is to help them to remember them. This may seem trivial but we know that people can only keep one or two ideas in working memory at a time and that recall fades quickly. Thirty seconds after hearing Kimani's great idea it will be hard for his classmates to remember exactly what he said. You can write a brief reminder on the board. “Jonas alarmed by feelings bc he doesn't know what they are” or perhaps simply “‘Jonas doesn't know what feelings are’—Kimani.”

Now students can think about Kimani's comment. Remember it. Refer back to it. Even with several comments made in between, they can use *Habits of Discussion* not just to build off of the most recent comment but those that happened several minutes ago. It provides the assist when a student says, “I'd like to build off of what Kimani said earlier about Jonas not knowing what feelings are ...”

You can do this on the whiteboard, the overhead projector, or chart paper. It's important to note that it is different from *technique 22, Board = Paper*, because students may well *not* be writing what you write. You are the memory scribe. Their job is to listen. Here's Jessica Bracey doing that as Omar comments in her Keystone video.

---

<!-- Page 662 -->

She is helping to keep his idea alive for students to use throughout discussion and you can see the results.

Of course, as with anything else, there's some explicit instruction to be done. Students won't know what you're doing and how to make use of it when you chart unless you tell them: *I'm writing down key ideas up here so you can refer back to them and tie your ideas together. It will help us have a real discussion where we connect and remember one another's ideas.*

# TECHNIQUE 46: DISCIPLINED DISCUSSION

---

<!-- Page 663 -->

An effective discussion needs a shared purpose—on two levels. It needs a specific topic participants tacitly agree to discuss, and it needs a shared mental model of what it means to discuss something. If people are just trying to prove they are right, it's a debate. Discussion should involve some reflection along the lines of, what have I, or we, learned here? And a discussion is often better if it's cohesive. “If you chase five rabbits you catch none,” a friend of mine says, meaning that if you try to talk about everything, you resolve nothing.

With that in mind, here's a key moment from a discussion in Rue Ratray's English class, taped when he taught at Edward Brooke Charter School in Boston. The discussion was about Lois Lowry's novel *The Giver*, specifically the relationship of individuals to authority. The community was very accepting of government dictates, students observed. Then a student named Sofia commented that Jonas was an exception. He was “not willing to accept or agree with the ideas of the government.” Rue called on another student, Khalid, but Khalid suddenly shifted the subject.

“Carol and I talked about how we liked this phrase that …”

“Wait a minute, Khalid,” Rue enjoined. “What do you think about what Sofia said?”

When Rue redirected Khalid before he could share his idea, he risked disrupting his train of thought. He might forget what he had been about to say. Why do that? The reason is that Rue's eye was on the long game—he was reminding Khalid that a comment too disconnected from the previous comment or topic detracted from discussion even if it was interesting to him. Rue was teaching students a critical aspect of having a successful discussion by reminding them of the self-discipline necessary to discussion. Effective contributors to a discussion recognize when changing the subject detracts from the overall conversation. Giving

---

<!-- Page 664 -->

students the opportunity to practice the skills of discussion means supporting them as they develop this meta-awareness.

Unfortunately, in many classrooms, the moment when someone finishes a thought means it's open season; there's no expectation that the next comment will stick with the same topic and the result is conversations that have a fractured and scattered feel. In fact, students will often say, “What I was going to talk about was …” which implies that they are changing the topic (and that the previous comment was relatively unremarkable). Do this enough and you prevent the substance and depth that come from wrestling with the nuances of a specific issue. And it suggests to previous speakers that their comments weren't worth making. Why keep contributing if you say something you've been thinking about and it's ignored by the next speaker as if it never happened? It's easily overlooked, in other words, that one of the most important characteristics of a good discussion is topicality.

Ryan Miller used a similar move in a recent lesson. Students were examining primary source documents about President Teddy Roosevelt's intervention in Panama. One student commented that Roosevelt's claims that the United States was not involved were an effort to hide the government's intentions. The subsequent student made a sudden change of topic, almost as if the previous point had never been made, so Ryan stepped in: “That's interesting, but I'd like to hear someone respond to Sara's comment before we move on to another one.”

Ryan’s and Rue's goal in these interventions was to have students internalize a mental model of discussion that includes self-discipline and a recognition of the need to read one's audience among participants. In a good

discussion people don't just talk about anything they want at any time.

## Managing the Meta

This is an example of what I call *managing the meta*, the first part of the technique *Disciplined Discussion*, which encourages focus and self-awareness in discussion. That sometimes requires keeping a discussion “inside the box,” and reminding students “Let's stay on our original topic right now” or asking, “How is this connected to the topic at hand?”

## Intentional Reflection

The second part of *Disciplined Discussions* is *intentional reflection*, an adaptation of *stamping*, a term Paul Bambrick-Santoyo uses to describe writing after a discussion in which participants summarize key ideas or, in this case, reflect deliberately on questions like: “What did I (or we) learn from our discussion?” or “How did your opinions change?” Writing about these topics gives them importance and permanence and ensures that time spent in discussion isn't wasted. As Paul Kirschner and colleagues remind us, learning is a change in long-term memory. The discussion may be rich but unless students remember it, they won't have learned much. Writing helps bridge that gap.

The more time you spend in discussion, the more important it is to make sure that clear takeaways are framed and the process of encoding them in long-term memory is begun. *Intentional reflection* means a discussion doesn't just end with the teacher saying it's over. It ends with the teacher saying something like:

> “Take a minute to jot down your takeaways from the discussion.”

Or (to emphasize listening a bit more): “Take a minute to jot down a summary of some of the more useful comments from your peers.”

Or (to emphasize openness to new ideas): “Take a minute to jot down the ways your perspective changed in the course of the discussion.”

This would also be a great occasional application of *Art of the Sentence* (technique 41):

“Great discussion. Two minutes now to capture your most important takeaway in one carefully crafted sentence.”

Or, “Great discussion. Two minutes to capture the two differing points of view we heard in one complete sentence.”

Of course you don't have to be a purist about using *Art of the Sentence*. *Silent Solo* could suffice. “Two minutes to capture the three key historical events we discussed and how they were connected. Go!”

I prefer writing over *Turn and Talk*, though. Writing encodes ideas more deeply in memory—we remember what we think about, Daniel Willingham tells us, and writing is usually a harder form of thinking than talking. Plus it leaves students with a written record they can refer back to.

Interestingly, in her Keystone, Arielle Hoo concludes her class discussion of parallel overlapping lines with a written summary, but she makes it a shared class activity. She provides a sentence starter and various students contribute ideas. She refines and selects from among them, creating a summary that is superior in content to what any single student could have created. Students then copy this down as their record of the proceedings. My team and I call this sort of written summary—one that’s both a shared creation and curated by the teacher, one that results in an exemplar of higher quality than any individual might produce—a

Collectively Worked Example. It's a great way to end a class.

# Managing the Meta—The Case for Inside the Box

We tend to valorize “thinking outside the box.” The phrase evokes creativity, cognitive leaps, and the raw stuff of insight. In classroom discussion, however, keeping it *inside* the box—staying focused on a specific topic, maintaining steady, deep reflection on all sides of an idea—is often more valuable. Of course, the two aren't mutually exclusive, but there is a certain tension between them. Students sometimes reach for comments that are far afield rather than focused and topical because they believe that's how “outside the box” happens. We sometimes even encourage their doing so. Still, if we don't teach students how to keep insights on topic, we are guaranteed great leaps sideways, occasionally at the expense of forward progress. Let me give you an example.

I spent some time observing classes in a school near me, and one of the things that struck me was the way the discussions differed among classrooms. In some, students made relevant and insightful contributions. In others, comments were interesting to the student who made them, but not as useful or thought-provoking to others. They were arcane and solipsistic—smart, perhaps, but so self-absorbed that it was hard to say. The curious thing is that I was observing the same group of students in different rooms. I started to wonder, “Why were they so alert to their peers' perspective in one class and the opposite in another?”

In one classroom, the teacher asked, “What is fairness?” One student answered with an obscure quotation from a comic book that no one else had heard of. Another replied

that it was like pizza. They veered from one obscure analogy to another. They were certainly outside the box. The teacher too made obscure connections. The text they were reading was like “that commercial on TV.” Then it was “like that song,” and he quoted some lyrics. He called these text-to-text connections, but they weren’t. Their effect was not to cast the text in a new and revealing light but to distract the class from any sustained reflection on it. Student comments mirrored his choices. They referred to something arcane or comprehensible only to them and he never helped them think about how useful their comments were to others. Perhaps his mental model was vague and he didn’t envision discussions as being characterized by comments that were topical and timely. I once had a professor who would occasionally respond to comments, “How does that relate to what we were just talking about?” His doing so helped us see very quickly that discussion was not just about us and our desire to talk about what thoughts were on our minds, but about the mutual goal of developing shared insight on a topic.

The power of framing expectations about discussion was evident in the math class many of the same students had been in earlier in the day. It was their first day studying rate of change, and their teacher had just observed that time was almost always an independent variable when it appeared in a rate-of-change problem. “It’s going to be your independent variable 99 percent of the time,” he said. He asked students if they had any questions. Several ensued in which students reflected on how certain rate-of-change problems would be represented on a line graph. Then a student asked for an example of a situation in which time could be the dependent variable, and the teacher said, “To think of an example, I’d have to come up with something pretty obscure. Maybe we’ll do that later, but for

---

<!-- Page 669 -->

now let's just assume it's going to be the independent variable."

Despite his hint, another student raised her hand and began brainstorming “what ifs,” wondering aloud how time might become a dependent variable. It was great that she was asking herself this question, and although many teachers might have encouraged it, her comment was less useful to others in the room. The teacher was trying to help the class come to a collective understanding of rate of change at a conceptual level, not to digress into an area he'd just indicated was not worth the time. His response was brilliant: “You're thinking outside the box. But I want us to focus on thinking inside the box right now, on really understanding rate of change, what it is and how it works. So let's stay there right now.” Then he smiled genuinely and sincerely and they went back to talking about rate of change.

Although some teachers might be reluctant to circumscribe discussion in this way, his doing so was immensely productive. Essentially he said, “Here's what we're doing as a group right now. That's something you should pay attention to when you speak up—what the group is trying to do and why.” Part of a teacher's responsibility is to teach students when and how to participate productively in a discussion.

In short, you *manage the meta* when, through feedback and modeling, you guide students in the dynamics of building conversation, specifically how to make the kinds of comments that are most productive in a given setting. Rather than assuming they know how to make a discussion valuable, you invest in teaching them as they struggle forward. Perhaps there are times when you want *more* outside the box. If that's the case, you might use meta comments like, “I want to hear some people who are willing

to make some broader connections.” Either way, managing the meta relies on two key tools: modeling the kind of participation you want in a discussion and providing constant supportive feedback on how to engage your peers in a meaningful, connected, and mutually productive way.

# Notes

1.  Most people, you may have noticed, are confident that this applies to people other than themselves.

2.  We should realize another risk: students often recognize that expressing ardent opinions—even ones they may not truly hold—shows interest and is a route to a higher grade. Colby may well know that punching up his passion about the Kansas Nebraska Act is a great way to enhance his grade.

3.  To be clear, there are times when we encourage talking to allow students to process or to increase Participation Ratio. This is great, but is different from discussion, when we must support students in remembering and building their skills for the listening portion of the process.

4.  There are several vignettes about this in *The Hidden Lives of Learners*.

5.  There are lots of different ways to designate the two halves of each pair—“window” and “door” or “wall” (designating which part of the classroom they are closer to) often works.

6.  Another realization about *Turn and Talks* that comes from online teaching is that a lot of time gets wasted in the awkward social dance of starting the conversation. Who will go first? What do you say to begin? Shaping the

routine early in the year—for example, by saying “When you get to your breakout room, simply greet your partner and say ‘What did you think?’ ”—helped a lot of teachers with this. Perhaps there's a classroom equivalent.
