### TECHNIQUE 15: NO OPT OUT  

Consider this moment from a recent lesson in Denarius Frazier's tenth-grade geometry class (video: Denarius Frazier: Quadrilateral). His students are about to attempt to prove that a given shape is not a square, but first Denarius pauses and asks the class, “Before we get into that, what is the definition of a square?” It's important that every student start with sound knowledge of the basics.  

He calls on Aaron, who responds: “All four angles and all four sides are equal.” It's a solid answer, one that might suffice in another class, but Denarius says, “Hmm … that's about 80 percent of the way there. It can be a little more specific.” It's a bit of a *Right Is Right* moment (technique 16)—Denarius is holding out for *all-the-way right* rather than *mostly right*, even while acknowledging the value of Aaron's answer.  

Next Denarius calls on Anastasia, who has raised her hand. She adds precision: “A quadrilateral with four 90-degree angles and four congruent sides.” At this point, with the fully correct answer having been shared, many teachers might simply move on and return to the proof. But Denarius has something else on his mind, and he instead returns to Aaron: “Back to you, Aaron. What was the difference?”  

Aaron says, “I didn't add the quadrilateral.”  

“The quadrilateral and …?” asks Denarius.  

“And the degrees of the angle,” Aaron finishes.

---

<!-- Page 279 -->

“Yes, so it's, 90-degree angles and all four sides are congruent.” Denarius confirms before moving on to the proof: “How can we prove that this is not a square?”

Denarius's standard of correctness is high and that helps make his classroom a rigorous place. And his preparation is impeccable. But the heart of the interaction is something else subtle but powerful called *No Opt Out*, which is the name for the moment when he returns to Aaron, whose initial answer was not correct.

When a student does not answer correctly, teachers often call on another student or provide the correct answer themselves. But the class hearing the right answer is different from the original student understanding it and being accountable, with caring and humanity, for expressing that understanding.

When Denarius returns to him, Aaron explains the difference between his own answer and Anastasia's. The “return” closes the loop and ensures understanding.

There are a variety of ways to return productively in a *No Opt Out*. For example, Denarius could have asked Anastasia not to answer herself but to provide a cue (a focused and productive hint) to Aaron and then returned to him for the answer. Or he could have asked Anastasia for the correct answer but, in returning to Aaron, had him begin by repeating Anastasia's answer in an effort to encode it in long-term memory. Or he could have shared a gold standard definition of a square himself and then returned to Aaron to ask for the gap between the original answer and the model. He could have asked Aaron to both repeat Anastasia's answer and explain the gap between his own and hers. If it had been a problem such as *What's the measure of the angle here?*, he could have given Aaron another example to try and succeed on, upon returning to him. I'll discuss these variations later, but the core idea is

---

<!-- Page 280 -->

that when a sequence beginning with a student unable or (as we will discuss) unwilling to answer ends with a return in which the student answers successfully the result is progress toward mastery—and a culture that promotes learning.

For now, though, it's most important to focus on Denarius's tone. He's emotionally constant, signaling steady support with his voice and body language: *In this class, we get things wrong and then get them right and we keep moving. That's normal. You're doing fine.* A teacher executing a No Opt Out should avoid indicating frustration at the original response but also, in most cases, go easy on the “awesome awesomeness”—that is, in praising a student's small success so highly that the teacher seems either disingenuous or surprised by the student's success (*OMG, you got it right!*).

In this example, Denarius chooses his words wisely in other ways as well. “About 80 percent of the way there,” he says, which both diffuses any anxiety for Aaron—after all, he's mostly right—and also cues him to attend carefully to Anastasia's response because there's a fair chance that Denarius is coming back to him to close the loop. In some cases—for example, earlier in the year before students have come to understand that Denarius commenting on the almost-ness of the answer is a signal that he is probably going to coming back to with a question—Denarius might be more explicit: “Not quite. Listen to the next answer and I'll come back to you.”

It's worth noting that teachers often promise students they “will come back” to a student when they struggle publicly but, barring their use of No Opt Out, often forget to do so. I suspect this is because (a) our working memory is always taxed when we are teaching, so the longer the amount of elapsed time, the harder it is to remember that a student

---

<!-- Page 281 -->

got it wrong or what she got wrong, or (b) we intend to go back but can't exactly imagine what that would look like, so mostly we are announcing our intent. *I am concerned that you struggled and know I should address it. I should not leave this as is.* If we don't have a technique for putting that intent into practice, we're likely to insert a bookmark that we never return to.

One of the benefits of *No Opt Out* is that it gives you a model—or a series of models—for how to go back to a student and quickly so you don't lose sight of the moment. This is not to say that you should use the tool reflexively—not every erroneous response needs to trigger a *No Opt Out*. A thousand good things exist in balance and compete for time and focus in a classroom. There's plenty of discretion to be had in when, how often, and what type, but the idea is powerful—returning to a student who hasn't gotten an answer correct and allowing, encouraging, sometimes prompting them to answer again ensures that students rehearse success rather being left dangling when they don't succeed. Done well it often goes a step further, affording a student who's struggled an opportunity to “get it right” in front of peers. It can also be an effective response to learned helplessness—the awkward moments when a student simply won't try. But we will come to all of that.

For now, let's watch a second example from one of Denarius's classes. In *Denarius Frazier: Cosine*, ninth-grade students are solving algebraic equations during guided practice. “Two cosine theta equals the square root of 2,” Denarius says, explaining the next step to students.

“Wrap this problem up … Shayna,” Denarius says. He's going back and forth between modeling steps himself and allowing students to solve parts of the problem, using what Barak Rosenshine would define as guided student practice

---

<!-- Page 282 -->

and others might call the “we” stage in an overall lesson arc of I do/we do/you do. The class's pace is quick and efficient—the *Cold Calls* are predictable—and Shayna hasn't raised her hand but she also doesn't seem the least bit surprised to be called on. And the tone is supportive.

“Divide [by] two on both sides,” Shayna advises.

“And we're left with what?” Denarius asks. Shayna responds and Denarius sends the class into a *Turn and Talk* (see technique 43) to solve the problem in pairs (“Turn and talk to your partner; I want an answer for theta in thirty seconds”).

Out of the *Turn and Talk*, Denarius *Cold Calls* Deandrea and she's ready with the answer: “Forty-five degrees.” Other students snap to show they agree.

But Denarius wants to test for reliability, to make sure students understand the process Deandrea used to solve. “What do we have to do to get that forty-five degrees? Michael?” It's a *Cold Call*—crucial in checking for understanding, as Denarius is doing here. And it's a good thing he asked because, despite snapping along in support of his classmate, Michael is a bit unclear. “Um … reverse?” he says, before trying again, “Oh, I'm sorry … secant?”

Michael is confused and, rather than waiting for further guesses, Denarius steps in. “We're coming back to you,” he says, warmly and without judgment, before calling on Kayla, who begins: “We have to do the inverse of cosine …” Moments later Denarius returns to Michael: “Why do we have to do the inverse of cosine, Michael?” Whereupon Michael explains the importance of solving algebraically.

Denarius’s tone is supportive throughout, but he also signals normalcy. Of course some students were momentarily confused. Of course Michael got it right in the

---

<!-- Page 283 -->

end. “Go ahead and flip to your *Exit Ticket*. You have three minutes,” he says.

Before his “return” to Michael, Denarius uses that phrase, “We’ll come back to you” here. The powerful thing is that with a clear procedure or recipe to follow that outlines his reaction—a technique he’d made familiar almost to the point of automaticity—he actually does return to Michael and helps him progress in his understanding.

## Theme and Variation

*No Opt Out*, as I mentioned, comes in various forms and it’s worth comparing the two examples from Denarius’s classroom to begin considering both themes and variations.

In both cases, going back to the student who was initially incorrect (or partially correct) provides them the opportunity to improve or clarify their original answer. It also gives another student in the room the opportunity to provide an “assist.” Allowing students to help their peers in a positive and public way builds community and culture—or, more precisely, if you’ve established an intentional culture where teamwork thrives, and students support one another, then *No Opt Out* enhances that culture richly and lets students help their peers via their academic accomplishment.

In both cases, tone matters: Denarius is consistent, clear, and steady. *Culture of Error* (technique 12) thrives: Mistakes are useful learning tools. When confusion emerges, the class works through it. There’s no blaming of the learner but also not a profusion of “awesome awesomeness.” In most cases a sprinkle of subdued positivity suffices (“Well done, Aaron” or “Now you’ve got it, Michael”). There will be occasions when celebration is warranted; it will sing more if it is reserved mostly for those moments.^1

---

<!-- Page 284 -->

A subtle difference between these two clips also highlights the flexibility in the technique. Michael is confused; Aaron's response was strong and very close to gold standard, so Denarius “previews” for Michael—that is, he lets him know explicitly that he'll be coming back to him. This makes the process transparent and reminds Michael to listen carefully to Kayla's response.

The setting is also worth noting in the two clips. The first happens during a brief interval of retrieval practice. The second comes at the end of guided practice and right before students solve on their own. Both of these moments of transition are critical from a Check for Understanding perspective when you would especially want to ensure student knowledge. You can't always use *No Opt Out* but Denarius has chosen his timing strategically.

The second example also might have offered Denarius the alternative of using a cue if he'd wanted to. That is, instead of asking Kayla for the answer he could have first previewed—“OK, Michael, let's get you some help. I'm going to come back to you”—and then asked, “Without giving Michael the answer, who can tell him one word that will help him here?” Let's say that here Kayla raises her hand and replies, “Inverse. He has to use the inverse of something.” He can see now in Michael's face that this has been enough and returns to him: “Ready now, Michael?”

“Yes. We need to take the inverse of cosine and then …”

We've come across three terms that are helpful in using to the technique so far. The *return* is the part of the *No Opt Out* when you go back to a student who initially struggled to answer fully. A *preview* is when you tell that student explicitly that you are coming back to them to encourage them to listen carefully to peers, as in: “OK, listen carefully and I'll come back to you.” You don't have to use a preview, but it can be helpful in establishing familiarity with and

---

<!-- Page 285 -->

transparency in the process for students. Just make sure to remember to return to a student when you've said you will! Finally there's the *cue*. That's the idea that you can sometimes ask additional students you call on to provide key information that the initial student can use to answer after the return rather than the complete answer. This allows the initial student to do more of the work (and show that he or she can do more of the work). Note that, as I discuss below, a *cue* is different from a hint because the teacher guides the student to give especially useful information.

---

<!-- Page 286 -->

# On Cues, Hints, and Questions

If I ask James to identify the subject of the sentence “My mother wasn’t happy” and he can’t answer, I might say: “Can anyone give James a hint to help him find the subject?” and a helpful student might offer, “It starts with the letter *m*.” This would help James guess the answer, but it wouldn’t teach him anything that would help him in future situations.

I use the word *cue* in place of *hint* then to refer to a prompt that offers additional information that is useful in building understanding.

Five types of cues are particularly useful in a *No Opt Out*. Here are some examples and the answers they might yield. You’ll likely find even better ways to cue students in your own subject and grade.

1. The place where the answer can be found  
   “Who can tell Julia where she could find the answer?” [It’s in the diagram at the top of page 3.]

2. The next step in the process that’s required at the moment  
   “Who can tell Justine what the next thing she should do is?” [Justine, try to distribute first.]

3. Another name for a difficult term  
   “Who can tell Kevin what *distribute* means?”  
   [Kevin, when you distribute you multiply the outside term by each term inside the parentheses.]

4. An identification of the mistake  
   “Who can explain what Roberto might have done wrong here?” [He might have dropped a negative

---

<!-- Page 287 -->

sign when he distributed.]

5. A word that might be useful  
“Who can tell Michael a word that might be useful to him in solving?” [Michael, the word *distribute* is really important here.]

An alternative to cuing is to allow students to ask questions as part of a *No Opt Out*. I got this idea from Michael Towne, one of the winners of the 2014 Fishman Prize, a national award given to top teachers in the country. “If I ask them, ‘What's the speed of the magnetic flux here?’” Michael told me, “I want them to be able to say, ‘I'm actually not that clear on what you mean by magnetic flux.’” To Michael that's a sign of maturity, so he explains to students that they always have this option and encourages them to use it. But the sequence still ends with a *No Opt Out*: “OK, now that we've clarified what magnetic flux is, what's its speed here?”

You can see a really engaging example of cuing in the video *Derek Pollak: Fifth Root*, shot at North Star Academy High School in Newark, New Jersey. Notice Derek's warm and encouraging demeanor as both he and then a peer provide cues to a student solving a problem during retrieval practice.

I mentioned previously that there were variations to the *No Opt Out* technique. I'm going to map them out a bit more now.

## Options for What Happens Before the Return

Go to another student and ask for the answer. Return.  
“Not quite. Who can tell us the definition of juxtaposition?”

---

<!-- Page 288 -->

*Go to another student and ask for a cue. Return.*

“Not quite. Who can give Kayla an example of juxtaposition? And then, Kayla, I’ll ask you to tell us the definition.”

*Give a cue yourself. Return.*

“Not quite. Kayla, what if I told you that juxtaposition always involved two characters, images, or things. That help?”

If it didn't help, you might go to another student for the answer—“OK, who can give us a definition of juxtaposition?”—and then return yet again to Kayla after: “Great, now, Kayla, you tell me.” The last step might seem unnecessary, but it does several key things. It ensures that Kayla listens to the answer. By causing her to repeat it, it helps her to encode it in long-term memory, and it reduces the chances that Kayla might use “I don't know” on purpose to avoid having to answer. I'll return to this idea later.

*Give a gold standard answer. Return with “Try to tell me that back.”*

“Not quite. I'll give you what I think is the ideal definition of juxtaposition, then you try to tell me back. Juxtaposition is when an author places two unlike objects or characters in close proximity within the text to emphasize their contrast. See if you can tell me back?”

This is the least common form of *No Opt Out* (I'll discuss at least one application later), but if you do use it be sure to follow it with a *Stretch It* (*technique 17*) to give the student the chance to show that they can do more than repeat. As in, “Good. Now that you've got the definition, can you think of an example from the play?” Or, “Good, now that you've got the definition, who is Callie being juxtaposed with in the novel?” Or, to use a different example:

---

<!-- Page 289 -->

"Jasmine, an inverse is what I multiply a number by to get a product of 1. What's an inverse?

"What you multiply a number by to get the product 1."

"Good, so what would I multiply one-half by to get 1?"

"Two."

"Good, and what's the inverse of one-half?"

"Two."

"Yeah, and what's the inverse of two?"

"One-half."

"Beautiful. Now you've got it."

## Options for What You Ask a Student to Do After the Return

The point of No Opt Out is to cause the original student to give the correct answer and successfully solve the problem or encode the information. After that you can add other steps that increase the value of the interaction.

*Explain why the answer is the answer.*

Ask the original student to explain or analyze the answer in some way. Denarius uses this in the second example. “Why do we have to take the inverse of cosine, Michael?”

*Explain the difference between original and final answers.*

Denarius uses this in the first example: “Back to you, Aaron. What’s the difference?” Aaron has to note what he left out.

*Apply the idea or complete a similar example.*

“Good, now that you’ve got the definition, Kayla, who was the author juxtaposing Martina to in the opening scene?”

Or perhaps:

---

<!-- Page 290 -->

“What's eight times six? Justin?”

“Fifty-six.”

“Hmm. Listen carefully to Danielle because the eights are tricky. Danielle, what's eight times six?”

“Forty-eight.”

“What's eight times six, Justin?”

“Forty-eight.”

“Good. What about eight times seven?”

“Um … fifty-six.”

“And eight times eight?”

“Sixty-four.”

“Good. And eight times six once more?”

“Forty-eight.”

“Well done.”

**Some Combination of the Above**

Once a student gives you a correct answer, you may want let them use it or apply it in a variety of ways. Balancing the needs of time is always a challenge. There's only so much time you can spend doing No Opt Out, so you won't be able to do it with every wrong answer. But often it's surprising and unexpected to a student to have a teacher cause them to succeed on a question when they first appeared to struggle, so occasional opportunities to let a student shine a bit after the return can be powerful.

---

<!-- Page 291 -->

**Aidan Thomas Sticks with It**

You can see another example of *No Opt Out* in the video *Aidan Thomas: Y Intercept*. The clip starts with Aidan calling on Jahiem to plot a point on the graph of a line. He's asking for the y-intercept, in other words the point (0, X). It looks as if Aidan thinks this question will yield a quick and easy right answer, but Jahiem answers that it's the origin. “No,” Aidan chimes in. “That’s the trick. Not anymore.” His language is masterful here in normalizing the error and making Jahiem feel supported. Jahiem learns that what he thought was the answer (the same answer to a recent problem) was in fact “a trick.” This suggests that a common and natural mistake has been made.

He refers the question to Shawn, who answers that the y value is -1 and Aidan quickly makes his return: “Yeah, why is it -1, Jahiem?” The return shows faith in Jahiem. By asking him to explain Shawn's answer, he's arguably giving him the harder question. My reading of it is that Aidan thinks he'll get it right and have a chance to shine.

Unexpectedly, Jahiem struggles a bit, but with a bit of prompting, fixes his mistake. Aidan's response—“Nice self-correction,” he says, in a steady constant tone—is another bit of culture building. It reinforces the idea that making a mistake and catching it is normal and natural and lets Aidan give Jahiem credit for doing something well: spotting and fixing a mistake. Note that he doesn't overdo the positive reinforcement.

But the data also tells him Jahiem is confused, so eight minutes later, he *Cold Calls* to ask a question that again causes Jahiem to find the y-intercept. “What's the point

---

<!-- Page 292 -->

on this graph that we know ... [pause for everyone to think] ... Jahiem?"

Again we see Aidan's mastery of creating an environment characterized by a supportive tone but that also ensures that Jahiem is caused to get lots and lots of practice at something he hasn't yet mastered. “You're just using the wrong language,” he says when Jahiem struggles. There's no judgment or frustration in his tone. If anything, he's reminding Jahiem that he's closer than he thinks, but he avoids the temptation to gloss over his mistake (e.g. “You meant to say ‘y-intercept,’ right?”) and instead causes Jahiem to use the correct term.

Still Jahiem guesses wrong. Aidan goes to Tavon for the answer (0,2), and then returns again with a *Cold Call*, informed by the previous question Jahiem could not answer. It's still part of the *No Opt Out* in my mind —“That's called the what, Jahiem?” Jahiem's a little flummoxed, but once DJ gives Aidan the correct answer, he circles back to Jahiem and another student, CD, to make sure they lock in the term and, incidentally, hear themselves getting it right.

Throughout this sequence of events Aidan's tone remains warm and supportive. His positivity and equanimity show students that this *No Opt Out* is an expression of caring from an adult who seeks to ensure that they solidify their knowledge and help them succeed.

One thing you've probably noticed about the classrooms in which we've studied *No Opt Out* is the larger culture. Denarius has clearly established a climate of trust with his students. In both cases his students give full effort on the initial question and on the return. In Aidan Thomas’s and

---

<!-- Page 293 -->

Derek Pollak's classrooms, they persist even on multiple
returns.

What if that's not the case? What if individual students or a
roomful of students are not yet willing to struggle forward
like that? What if they do not yet fully trust the process and
are reluctant or resistant? What if they start not at a very
good answer, as Aaron does, but at “I have no idea”? How
to help them then?

Worse, what if they start at “I have no idea and am not sure
I wish to try”? Or even “I have no idea, so leave me alone”?

The reality of teaching is that we are often tasked with
addressing reluctance, resistance, learned helplessness, or
even outright refusal on the part of students. Some
students may give up in the face of what seems to us like a
minor challenge. You ask and the answer is very quickly “I
don't know.” Others may not be willing to even try in the
first place. You ask and the answer is “I don't know,” and
whether they realize it or not, if the *I don't knows* continue,
they create an easy out for themselves because in many
cases teachers don't know how to respond to “I don't
know”—times 100 if it's delivered with a bit of sharpness,
as if to say *I already told you I don't know*. When teachers
don't know how to respond to that, the result is often that
they leave the student alone for the rest of the class.

Or the rest of the week.

Or the rest of the year.

It's a case of the Band-Aid Paradox. We're asked to do
what's difficult and sometimes scary. It's easier to make
“the deal” with students, which is basically, *I will expect
nothing challenging or effortful from you if you agree not to
disrupt my class or behave negatively*. You can sit in the
corner and I will call on someone else. We all know that
there are classrooms where this happens. Students may not

see the long-term consequences of this terrible bargain, but teachers should be able to. I hope it is obvious to say that adults who care about young people cannot leave students alone like that and allow them to opt out of learning. That's not love and that's not respect.

Let me be clear—I recognize the complexity of such situations. They reflect Adeyemi Stembridge's observation that “Learning depends on trust that the ground will not give way beneath us, trust that effort is worthwhile.” Fixing a context where some students seek to opt out of learning requires a broad range of remedies. We always have to be building trust, for example—in the processes, in ourselves as teachers, or in the endeavor of school—and seeking to ensure that students who don't yet feel that trust come to do so. We need to build cultures that make students feel safe, successful, and known. Much of this book is about that struggle. It's why robust positive cultures that seek not just to limit negative behavior but build positive pro-learning behaviors like *Habits of Attention* ([technique 48](#)) are so profoundly important. People's actions are shaped, more than any other single thing, by the norms of others around them. When students are asked a question in class, whether they see their peers' encouraging faces supporting them, or the backs of uninterested heads goes a long way toward determining whether they take the risk of revealing what they know and what they don't. Similarly, we have to build cultures of error ([Chapter Two](#)), seek to motivate and inspire, and establish the caring and expectations of *Warm/Strict* ([technique 61](#)).

But even as we do these things, even if we have accomplished them for the majority of students in our classes, the moment will come when a student will not be able to answer or won't want to answer and will choose to opt out. The student will say *I don't know* in one of the ways described above, or will say nothing at all, or will say

---

<!-- Page 295 -->

nothing at all with their words but a great deal with their eyes, and no matter how much you understand the imperative of trust and relationships, in that moment you will still be standing there in need of a solution that can bring the situation toward a positive resolution, set basic expectations around effort, and reinforce both caring and accountability. Just telling students you care and want the best for them every so often is not likely to be sufficient to shift established behaviors and mindsets. You will require some option other than “the deal.”

Using a *No Opt Out* in this situation gives you a viable and productive response. In order to help students make the change from reluctance or refusal to effort, teachers must first reduce or eliminate the pathway to the “easy out,” forestall the opportunity for students to not engage a question when they don't know or don't want to try. It reduces the chances that a student might use “I don't know” on purpose to avoid having to answer because you have required effort of them (even if merely repeating an answer) and so have reduced the incentive. Then teachers must make a base level of effort a habit. That teachers should do this with understanding, humanity, and emotional constancy and that students should do it in a safe environment characterized by mutual respect and decency among students goes without saying.

*No Opt Out* can also help you to understand the student more. If you're not sure whether a student is trying, then simplifying the task, even to the point of asking for a mere restating of an answer, helps to reveal whether you are dealing with a confused student or an unwilling participant. A confused student can always make an effort to repeat. Once they've done that, you can start building them up, via little successes, *Stretch Its*, and positive reinforcement. The path forward involves showing them that they can

---

<!-- Page 296 -->

succeed—at first perhaps at small tasks and because you have insisted. Their success will grow from there.

In fact it's worth noting that while the culture you see in Denarius's classroom clearly supports his use of *No Opt Out* it is also in part a result of his use of the technique as well. His students eagerly engage because Denarius has insisted along the way, with care and humanity, that they do so. He has forestalled the easy out and his students, encouraged to take the riskier path, have mostly come to appreciate that and to trust him. In the end most students know the teacher who makes “the deal” is not the one who cares most about them.2

And while the progress a student makes in answering correctly via *No Opt Out* may seem trivial, research on motivation tells us that succeeding makes students want to try more. This is true even of small successes. So when students are stuck and they don't know, letting them see themselves answering correctly not only helps in the short run but in the long run.

And if your *No Opt Out* reduces the task to something very simple and a student persists in refusing to try, then you know clearly that you will have a time for limit setting, a different conversation, perhaps in private, along the lines of: “Charlie, you don't have to get the answers right in my class, but you will be expected to try. You're too capable not to.” There are, sadly, students for whom we will have to make it harder not to try than to try. I hope that most of your use of *No Opt Out* is not in such settings. I too wish that such cases were not the reality of our world, but they are and it's our responsibility to be prepared.

## Adding Rigor to *No Opt Out*

Over time my team and I have found that *No Opt Out* often works best when it is most rigorous—the more it rehearses

---

<!-- Page 297 -->

success and lets a student have something to be genuinely proud of at the end of the sequence, the better. This turns setback to triumph and I've often noticed that many of the most able teachers with *No Opt Out* follow up right away to add a challenge or an extra practice, much as you'll read about in *Stretch It* ([technique 17](technique_17)).

Consider this very basic interaction:

*Teacher:* What's three times five? Carson.

*Carson:* Eight!

*Teacher:* It's not eight. Who can tell Carson what operation he used?

*Jalani:* He used addition instead of multiplication.

*Teacher:* That's right. So, Carson, what's three times five?

*Carson:* Three times five is fifteen.

*Teacher:* Yes, good. And what's five times three?

*Carson:* It's fifteen, also.

*Teacher:* Good. And four times five?

*Carson:* Twenty.

*Teacher:* Oh, you've got it now! I can't stump you.

This teacher not only gives Carson extra practice at a skill he struggled with but also engineers the experience so the sequence ends with Carson showing that his success was no fluke. He answers several questions correctly; his teacher can't "stump" him. Consider how this sort of interaction turns the tables after a "wrong" answer. Or consider how some small tweaks of this interaction could make it not only positive but more rigorous:

*Teacher:* What's three times five? Carson.

*Carson:* Eight!

*Teacher:* It's not eight. Who can tell Carson what operation

---

<!-- Page 298 -->

he used?
Jalani: He used addition.
Teacher: That's right. So, Carson, what's three times five?
Carson: Three times five is fifteen.
Teacher: Yes, good. And if I wasn't sure, what operation could I use to check that?
Carson: You could use division.
Teacher: Good. Tell us how.
Carson: Well, you'd divide fifteen by five and get three, and you'd know your multiplication was right.
Teacher: Thank you, Carson.

In this case, the teacher has focused on asking not another version of the same question, but a different, related question. In both cases, she is using her follow-up to shape Carson's experience of success, as well as to push his skills.

The following case studies show ways you might use a "stretch" after a successful No Opt Out to build rigor and culture.

# Case Study 1

*Ms. Klein:* What's the definition of *vengeance*? Carla.  
*Carla:* Um ...  
*Ms. Klein:* Shakani? *Vengeance*?  
*Shakani:* *Vengeance* is violent revenge, getting back at someone who got you.  
*Ms. Klein:* Thanks, Shakani. So what's *vengeance*, Carla?  
*Carla:* Violent revenge.  
*Ms. Klein:* So who seeks *vengeance* in *Romeo and Juliet*, Carla?  
*Carla:* Tybalt, when he says, “This must be a Montague. Fetch me my sword.”  
*Ms. Klein:* Tybalt is doing what when he says that?  
*Carla:* Looking for *vengeance*.  
*Ms. Klein:* And would you agree that examples of people seeking *vengeance* are rare indeed in the play?  
*Carla:* No. Pretty much everyone is seeking *vengeance*.  
*Ms. Klein:* Nice, Carla. It does seem like just about everybody had *vengeance* on the brain.

## Case Study 2

*Mr. Vaca:* What's the multiplicative inverse of negative three, Jason?  
*Jason:* Three.  
*Mr. Vaca:* But if I multiply negative three times three I get negative nine. Who can tell Jason what the multiplicative inverse of negative three is? Carlos?  
*Carlos:* The multiplicative inverse of negative three is negative one-third.  
*Mr. Vaca:* What is it, Jason?  
*Jason:* Negative one-third.  
*Mr. Vaca:* Good. Why, Jason?  
*Jason:* Because negative three times negative one-third equals one.  
*Mr. Vaca:* Good. So now tell me the multiplicative inverse of negative one-fifth.  
*Jason:* It's negative five.  
*Mr. Vaca:* And four?  
*Jason:* One-fourth.  
*Mr. Vaca:* (Smiling) Well, now you're just showing off.  

## TECHNIQUE 16: RIGHT IS RIGHT  

In almost every lesson, there comes a moment when a student's answer is similar to what you hoped you'd get (or, even better, to the exemplar you wrote when preparing your lesson), but something is still missing. The gist is there, or a kernel of the insight, but it's also not a response

---

<!-- Page 301 -->

that fully answers the question or completely captures the key idea. It's not a mistake, it's just not all the way complete.

What happens next? How do we validate a student's contribution while continuing to push for deeper and more precise thinking?

If we struggle in this moment, it may be in part because of our best intentions. We want to encourage students or we want to keep the class engaged or we need to make sure we get to the *Exit Ticket* before the bell rings, so we say “right” or “good” or “yes” to that almost-there response. However, there are real risks to calling “right” that which is not truly and completely right. Students look to their teachers as arbiters of quality. They rely on us to communicate with honesty and objectivity, using our expertise to evaluate whether responses have answered a question fully and well, so that they may better understand their own progress in learning. If we are not fully honest when we say, “Yes, you have done work of merit,” we not only misinform them but sow seeds that eventually erode that essential trust.

*Right Is Right* is about how to respond in the way that's most beneficial to students when an answer is almost right—pretty good, but not 100 percent.

Although it seems obvious that we should set a high standard, we often drop our standards unintentionally. Consider a common teacher habit that I refer to as “rounding up.” Rounding up involves a teacher responding to a partially or nearly correct answer by affirming it and in so doing, adding critical detail (perhaps the most insightful or challenging detail) to make the answer fully correct. Imagine, for example, a student who's asked at the beginning of *Romeo and Juliet* how the Capulets and Montagues get along. “They don't like each other,” the

---

<!-- Page 302 -->

student might say, in an answer that most teachers would, I hope, consider to be not fully correct—the gist, perhaps, but none of the detail and specificity that indicate a quality understanding. “Right,” the teacher might reply. “They don’t like each other, and they have been feuding for generations.”

Did you catch the rounding up? The student hadn’t included “and they have been feuding for generations.” That was the teacher's work, though she gave the student credit for it.

Sometimes a teacher will be even more explicit in giving a student credit for the rounding up, as in “Right, what Kiley said was that they don’t like each other and have been feuding. Good work, Kiley.” Either way, the teacher has set a low standard for depth and accuracy. The student who answered may think, “Good, I did it,” when in fact she didn’t. Moreover the teacher has crowded out Kiley’s own thinking by doing cognitive work that she could—and should—do herself. She has eliminated the opportunity for Kiley to recognize the gap between what she said and what would have constituted a top-quality answer.

Over time, persistent rounding up may cause students to internalize a low standard—they may believe they’re prepared and ready to succeed when, in fact, they’re not. The story of the American high school, TNT’s *Opportunity Myth* tells us, is an overwhelming number of students believing they’ve done everything right and still not being prepared to succeed in college. Resisting this kind of subtle erosion of expectations is part of our responsibility to students.

Another, possibly more likely outcome of persistent rounding up is an erosion of trust in and respect for the teacher. Students are highly attuned to moments of inauthenticity in the classroom. Rather than feeling the

---

<!-- Page 303 -->

boost of confidence her teacher might have hoped for, Kiley might be thinking, “That’s not what I said … Was she actually listening to me?” Perhaps she thinks it’s funny and she laughs. Or perhaps she thinks *I didn’t say any of that*, and she starts to suspect that her teacher will accept the bare minimum from her. As Adam Smith points out in *Theory of Moral Sentiments*, “It is only the most … superficial of mankind who can be much delighted with that praise that they themselves know to be … unmerited.”

Is “in the ballpark” good enough for Kiley? For all students? Rather than giving students the chance to persevere through a challenge or marshal additional cognitive resources, the teacher takes over and, in so doing, may actually (and paradoxically) signal a *lack* of confidence in Kiley’s abilities. As Peps Mccrea writes in his study of the science of motivation, “Success is not about making things easier for pupils. It is about helping them to do something they couldn’t do before.” Perversely, rounding up devalues students’ voices and insights, denying them that chance. False attributions of quality “only serve to undermine motivation and erode trust.”

Fortunately, a few specific actions can make it easier to consistently help students arrive at academically rigorous answers. Of course, in talking about right answers, I also acknowledge that there are questions for which there is no right answer. Every teacher asks questions that are open to interpretation or require nuance, but even in such cases, there remains a standard for what constitutes a complete, high-quality response. That standard too requires our daily attention and self-discipline.

## Holding Out for All-the-Way Right

The most basic form of *Right Is Right*, holding out for all-the-way right, means using phrases that cause students to

---

<!-- Page 304 -->

elaborate on and add to their initial thinking and so come to recognize what fully correct looks like—the opposite of rounding up. A teacher might use one of the following phrases in response to Kiley's answer about *Romeo and Juliet*:

> "True. They don't like each other. But can you observe a bit more about their relationship?"

> "Good start, Kiley. Can you develop your answer?"

> "Can you elaborate on what you mean by ‘don't like each other,’ Kiley?"

> "Thanks for starting us off, Kiley. Can you talk about the word Shakespeare uses to describe their relationship [that is, *feud*]?"

> "OK. Kiley said the Capulets and Montagues don't like each other. Can we put some more precise language to the task here?"

> "Thanks, Kiley. When you say they don't like each other, is that how they'd describe it?"

> "Thanks for kicking off our discussion, Kiley. Can you point us to some language in the Prologue that can help us get more specific?"

In holding out for all-the-way right, you set the expectation that ideas matter, that you care about the difference between the facile and the scholarly, and that you believe your students are capable of the latter. This faith in your students' ability sends a message that will guide students long after they've left your classroom. They will have been pushed and know they can do it if they push themselves.

There are two excellent examples of holding out for all-the-way right answers in the video *Akilah Bond: Keystone*. As students strive to figure out why Cam is helping Eric in the

---

<!-- Page 305 -->

Cam Jansen story they are reading, Cheyenne gives a strong answer that includes one of two possible reasons. At about 2:00 in the video Akilah says (with students chiming in): “Nice work, Cheyenne,” and praises her for having talked about both characters. She’s reinforced her effort. But then she adds, “There is something else we know about both characters that makes me think there’s another reason Cam is helping Eric.” There’s positive reinforcement for Cheyenne and also clarity about the fact that they’ve not yet arrived at a fully correct answer and Kimayah weighs in to add the critical detail.

Later Akilah asks Sonoa to explain why Eric asks Cam a question. Sonoa’s response is good, but afterwards, Akilah notes, “We’re missing something from Sonoa’s response. What are we missing?” she asks, and by not accepting an almost-right answer or not crowding out student thinking by rounding up herself, she allows Michael to do the work (and, as you’ll notice, be the hero).

A word about tone. Holding out for high standards does not imply being harsh or punitive—in fact, the opposite is true. As you read the responses to replace rounding up above, I hope you imagined a teacher smiling gently, nodding to encourage her students, and/or speaking in a supportive tone. “Personal warmth combined with active demandingness,” Zaretta Hammond writes in *Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain*, “earns the teacher the right to push for excellence and stretch the student beyond his comfort zone.” Students must feel that you believe in their ability to produce ideas of depth and quality, and when this is the case it yields a happy irony: Using *Right Is Right* demonstrates that you value the student as much as the answer. The goal isn’t simply to get the right answer spoken aloud (by someone), but to help each student push their answer to the level of precision and accuracy you

---

<!-- Page 306 -->

believe them capable of, and in so doing to believe themselves capable of excellence.

You can see that dynamic—personal warmth and high expectations for the quality and correctness of answers combining to express an ardent belief in what a student is capable of—in the video *Emily Badillo: Traitor*, which shows Emily's fourth-grade classroom at Excellence Girls Charter School in Brooklyn. After a student, Chassity, offers a convoluted (if earnest) response to her initial question, Emily explains with patience and emotional constancy what the question was asking and offers Chassity a moment to get her thoughts together. Chassity, perhaps feeling Emily's belief in her, does not give up and her hand is soon back in the air. Emily does not forget her. “Back to you, Chas,” she says lovingly, but again Chassity struggles. There's lots of thinking there, but not yet a right answer. “Eyes here,” Emily instructs the class, drawing attention away from Chassity for a moment to ease any tension she might feel. She then explains what the question is asking for, making the presumption that if Chassity is unclear, others in the room are likely to be as well. She wants a description of the change from one opinion to another among the soldiers. This time she gets an excellent answer from a classmate, but Emily still wants Chassity to get it right. And she wants Chassity to believe she can get it right. So she goes back to her. Chassity again struggles to focus on the question, so Emily steps in, again with warmth and care, to help her focus on the question as she begins framing her response with a sentence starter.

At this point Chassity's answer is dramatically improved. That's the good news. But it's still not right. And Emily thinks Chassity can get all the way there. So where most teachers would pull the ripcord and says “Great work, Chassity,” or round up and say, “What Chassity means is...,” Emily tells her, “You are so close. Add in your ... keyword

---

<!-- Page 307 -->

about the soldier's perspective. At first, what?” and now, at last, Chassity nails it. And when her classmates celebrate with her, she knows her accomplishment is real and that she has done something of merit. When Emily says Chassity's work is good, Chassity knows it's good. Recall what we've learned from Peps Mccrea: “Success ... is about helping [students] do what they could not do before.” When that happens, he observes, their motivation increases.

It’s important to note that it can take quite a bit of time, as we see in this clip, to help a student get from “not quite” to “nailed it.” In this case, Emily knew it was worth investing the whole class's time (as opposed to privately intervening with Chassity at another time) because Chassity's thinking was going to form the thesis of the essay every student was about to draft. They all benefited, culturally and academically, from Emily's investment in their peer.

## The Power of Scripting “Right”

Many factors account for why we sometimes don't hold out for all-the-way right answers. There's a time investment in pushing students to find the rest of the answer instead of simply providing it yourself, and we're always under pressure for time. “OK,” we think, “I have ten minutes left, and I just might make it through everything I planned,” and then we get an answer that's almost what we wanted. It's easy to jump at the quick fix. Another reason is that we want to be encouraging. It is the first time you can recall ever seeing Linda raise her hand. Her answer isn't perfect, but you want to be positive, make her feel successful, and encourage her to raise her hand again. So you avoid any implication of “not good enough.”

It turns out that preparation is one of the keys to keeping standards high. If we haven't clearly defined what a high-quality answer will include beforehand, it's hard to hold

---

<!-- Page 308 -->

out. If you're not sure of exactly what a great answer should contain, you won't be able to hold students to an exacting standard. Therefore, *Exemplar Planning* (technique 1) can help you do some of the “Is that good enough?” and “Is that all-the-way right?” thinking in advance. Of course this doesn't mean you can't override your initial model answer when you're surprised by an unexpected insight from a student; it just means you've started with a more concrete sense of the end goal, particularly for the most critical questions.

## Keeping “Almost There” Phrases in Your Back Pocket

A final reason why we sometimes accept answers that are less than fully correct is that we are not neutral observers of our own lessons. At the end of the day, we evaluate ourselves as teachers based in large part on how much we think our students learned. It's not just our students we're assessing but also ourselves, and we have a vested interest in telling ourselves that our students were successful. In a sense, if we give students credit for a correct answer, we give ourselves credit too. The phrase “I know what she was trying to say,” which is sometimes heard among teachers, acknowledges the problem; the unsaid second part of the sentence is, “but she didn't actually say it.” A lifetime of caring about students, of wanting to believe in them, and wanting to believe we've served them well puts us at risk of giving full credit for partial answers and pits us against some of our strongest impulses as educators.

Getting the most out of *Right Is Right* often means crafting two-part phrases that capture how we feel about our students' effort on one hand and how correct their answer was on the other. This makes it easier to be honest about both—that you *like what they've done so far* and that they're *closing in on the right answer*, that you *think they*

---

<!-- Page 309 -->

*know more than they said* but that *there's still some work to be done* or that you want them to *push themselves to be even more precise with their words*.

Take, for example, a scene from Lauren Harris Vance's class some years ago at Roxbury Prep Charter School in Boston. Lauren asked a student for the slope of a line. The actual slope was negative four-fifths, but the student gave the slope as four-fifths. Where another teacher might have said, “Right, except you need a negative sign,” Lauren said, “Hmm. I like *most* of that”—expressing in five short words both “You did some good work” and “You're still not all the way there, but I know you can close that gap.” The positivity, honesty, and simplicity of Lauren's response provides a road map for *Right Is Right* responses. To be effective with *Right Is Right*, reply to “almost right” answers in a way that is appreciative and often upbeat about what's been accomplished.

It's worthwhile to come up with a few commonly used phrases of your own—planned ways of saying just what you want in common situations. Keep them at the ready—in your back pocket, so to speak. Once you've come up with two or three phrases, use them to simply and consistently enforce *Right Is Right* and make rigorous answers a habit for your students.

Your phrases should:
- Show appreciation for good work that's been done.
- Be clear and honest about the fact that more work is needed.
- Be fast enough in the delivery to allow you and the student to quickly get back to the thinking.
- Be simple and familiar enough that you can use them with near-automaticity.

---

<!-- Page 310 -->

Finally, it's important—and often difficult—to remember that *Right Is Right* is a technique you use when an answer is mostly right rather than when it's just plain wrong. When you encounter a fully wrong answer, you'll want to use more of the techniques described in *No Opt Out*. Affirming a fully wrong answer as partially correct may only lead to additional confusion (and potentially consume more class time).

## Beyond Holding Out: More Versions of *Right Is Right*

Imagine a typical student in your classroom. You've called on her to explain Shakespeare's use of light and dark imagery in *Romeo and Juliet*, and she gamely gives it her best shot. While she's done the reading, you can tell as she begins her response that she's not exactly sure where she's going (and might be hoping to find her way onto more solid ground as she shares). Eager to please, this student may inadvertently reach into a bag of tricks many well-intentioned students before her have discovered. They include:

### The Kitchen Sink:

Sometimes students who are confused or unsure will simply start talking and say everything they can think of about the topic. The right answer might be in there somewhere, but so is a lot of other stuff and it's not at all clear that they know which is wheat and which is chaff. We should recognize that such “kitchen sink” answers require us to ask students to narrow in on the most important ideas. “Let me pause you for a second because you've said a lot there. Which part of what you said best answers the question?”

### Bait and Switch:

Students may at times choose to answer the question they *wished* they'd been asked

---

<!-- Page 311 -->

instead of the one they were asked. This could be because they misunderstood what you were specifically asking or because they understood one aspect of the text or question better than another and want to keep the discussion in “safe” territory. Thus students often need reminders to answer the actual question. “Yes, she's an inspiring hero. But just to bring us back a bit, the question was about how we'd characterize her relationship to her sister.”

**Heartfelt Topic:** Students may feel more comfortable sharing personal opinions, anecdotes, and affective responses because these opinions and observations are low-risk ways to engage with challenging material (and are unlikely to feel like “wrong” answers). And it's easy as a teacher to want to reinforce and respond to stories that start “something this made me think of that happened to me once was …” Sometimes the best response is to say, “Love that you're making connections, but for now let's stay focused on the question at hand… .”

**Vague Vagaries:** Students who are hazy on the details might respond in vague language, relying on pronouns or abstractions instead of names and concrete details. Rather than assuming we know (and the class knows) what they mean, we can push for precision, ensuring that we're all on the same page while helping students practice specificity in their language. We might say, “When you say “she gave it to her,” just tell us who ‘she’ is and who is the ‘her’ that she gave it to.”

To see *Right Is Right* in action, look at the video of Jennie Saliba's Year Five (fourth-grade) class at Great Yarmouth Academy in Great Yarmouth, England, where students are reading a nonfiction text on factory workers' lives in Dickensian England. “What made life in the workhouse so

---

<!-- Page 312 -->

tough, Alf?” she asks. Alf, eager to demonstrate his comprehension but perhaps not as focused on the precision of his answer as he might be, offers: “What made life in the workhouse so tough was the jobs, and that many people had … they were too young, too old, too ill to work, and also many people had to work.” Though his answer isn’t wrong, it’s imprecise and unclear. He has included several ideas, commingled, and Jennie can’t be sure if he knows clearly. “You gave me three or four answers there in one,” she responds with emotional constancy. “Just give me your first answer again, please.” Given the chance to revise his answer, Alf shows a more precise understanding of the text. “What made life so tough in the workhouses was that … . some jobs were very physically demanding,” Jennie seizes this moment not only to appreciate Alf’s answer, but to show him (and the rest of the class) how his increased precision improved the quality of his response. “In your first [answer] you gave me four bits of quite vague information. In that one, you perfected it with … the words you chose.” Jennie has both given Alf a chance to shine and moved the class toward a more specific understanding of the text—and how to respond with clarity.

There are other reasons why students sometimes answer a question other than the one you asked. For example, they sometimes conflate different types of information about a topic. For example, you ask for a definition (“Who can tell me what a compound word is?”), and a student replies with an example (“Eyeball is a compound word!”); or you ask for the description of a concept (“When we refer to the area of a figure, what are we talking about? Who can tell me what area is?”), and a student replies with a formula to solve for it (“Length times width”). In the thick of the action, it’s easy to miss that these are right answers to the wrong question. And as you begin to listen for them, you’ll find that these kinds of exchanges are far more common than

---

<!-- Page 313 -->

you might expect. If you ask students for a definition and get an example, try saying, “Kim, great example, but we need a definition.” After all, knowing the difference between an example and a definition matters and students need authentic opportunities to practice responding accurately to each type of question.

When student responses are vague, you can respond with a slightly different approach—asking for technical vocabulary or precise language. A student might indeed answer your question, but answer it like a horoscope—in such generalities that the answer could apply to any person or situation. Whereas *good* teachers get students to develop effective right answers using terms they are already comfortable with (“Volume is the amount of space something takes up”), *great* teachers get them to use precise technical vocabulary they're developing comfort with (“Volume refers to the cubic units of space an object occupies”). This response expands student vocabularies and builds comfort with the knowledge students will need throughout the unit (and even when they are in college). These teachers ask for specificity and follow up to reinforce.

To help you remember the scenarios in which we're most at risk of failing to set a high bar for right answers, here are four common scenarios and names to help recall them:

1. Hold out for all-the-way right: When we resist “rounding up” and saying that a student is right when he or she is only partially so.

2. Answer my question: When we push students to be disciplined about answering the question they were asked.

3. Specific vocabulary: When we ask students to lock down the details in precise words and technical

---

<!-- Page 314 -->

terminology.

4. *Leaner language*: When we ask students to improve an answer by using *fewer words* ... and sometimes clearer syntax.

# TECHNIQUE 17: STRETCH IT

In the classrooms with the highest academic expectations, right answers aren’t the end of the learning process; instead, they open the door to further challenge. “The reward for right answers will be harder questions,” is how music teacher John Burmeister describes it to his students, and over time *Stretch It*, the simple habit of responding this way—perhaps not every time but often enough—builds a powerful culture of self-confidence and curiosity.

What does this look like in practice? Let me start by showing you two classrooms where this happens. The first, the video *Arielle Hoo: How Did You Know?*, is a middle school math class. Even before Arielle starts questioning her students, you can sense the heightened level of expectations that have become part of Arielle’s classroom culture. Her student, Sarah, explains how she knew a proposed solution to a system of equations would be false: “I knew by looking at the graph, because the two lines are parallel so they would never intersect, which shows there is no solution.” Without being asked, Sarah uses technical vocabulary, and offers a full explanation for her response in a cogent and precise sentence.

Arielle is probably fairly happy with Sarah’s response. Proud of her even. But instead of saying simply, “Great work Sarah,” she responds: “How did you prove that algebraically? What method did you use?”

Arielle’s response to Sarah’s answer shows both cause—how does one get a classroom where students answer like

---

<!-- Page 315 -->

Sarah—and effect—what do you do to push the learning even further when you start to get answers like this.

“I used elimination,” Sarah says. “After I eliminated the x and the y I saw that it ended up with 0 = 2, but that's not true, so that's a false statement.”

“Awesome,” says Arielle before moving on to a question about a pair of coincidental lines.

Jaheem volunteers to answer this one and again we hear complete thoughts with technical vocabulary rather than simple one-word answers.

“The way you can figure out how many solutions [the system of equations] has is by looking at the graph, and you'll find that it has infinite solutions,” Jaheem says.

Which is true. And which causes Arielle to ask, “How do you know?” She wants to challenge Jaheem but also make sure the right answer is not a lucky guess. She wants to understand how he approached the problem and ensure he (and other students) can repeat the process on other problems.

Moments later, noting a tiny slip-up Arielle asks, “By two?” This allows him to catch his own error. “You'd multiply it by four and you would get the same equation,” he clarifies.

“Talk about the result,” Arielle continues, subtly giving him the opportunity to connect what he's said to other pieces of knowledge and thus build schema (connected bodies of knowledge).

Jaheem keeps going: “The result will be 0 = 0, which is infinite solutions.”

“Great,” says Arielle, “because it's what kind of statement?”

“A true statement.”

---

<!-- Page 316 -->

“Nice job. Send Jaheem some love,” she says to the class. His classmates make a gesture of support to “shine” on him while she says with a bright smile, “I loved your explanation.” This puts a bow on the interaction but even without the praise, I suspect Jaheem knows he's done well and feels a growing, well-earned confidence. He's connected the ideas he's begun learning into something cohesive. It's a great example of what a cognitive scientist would call elaboration, which takes place during retrieval practice. Arielle prompts Jaheem to review his understanding of an idea, connecting pieces and straining slightly to describe it in a new context and with new words. This elaboration will build Jaheem's knowledge and long-term memory, along with his confidence.

You can see a similar process in the video *Michael Towne: Red Dye*, from Michael's Physics classroom. Gathered around two beakers of water, one heated and one at room temperature, Michael places drops of dye in each and gives students a brief opportunity to discuss observations with a partner. The basic observation he knows they'll make is that the dye spreads more quickly in the warmer water. “It's way faster,” you can hear one student observe. But Michael's focus is not just on a simple observation but rather a deeper understanding of what students are seeing—as becomes clear when his questioning begins.

“What do you notice happening here? Go ahead,” he says, *Cold Calling* one student.

“The dye disperses faster in the hotter water than it did in the cooler,” the student responds. As in Arielle's classroom, you can almost hear him anticipating Michael's expectations: he's careful to use technical vocabulary (disperses) and to be precise in noting that he is comparing the “faster” movement of the dye in the warmer bath than in the cooler water. A correct observation made in a

---

<!-- Page 317 -->

scientific manner. But this correct answer has opened the door to a new challenge and Michael decides to *Stretch It*.

“OK, so what?” he responds.

The student pauses briefly, suddenly realizing he will now have to explain what's happening at a more substantive level. He's unsure at first but as he starts to articulate what's happening at a molecular level, he starts to gain confidence.

“The hotter the molecules get, the faster they move around in the beaker so if you put …”

Michael steps in briefly here:

“Which molecules?” he asks.

“The water molecules,” his student answers, but the challenge continues:

“Can you see any molecules?” Michael asks.

“No, but the dye movement shows how they're moving around,” the student pushes on.

Now Michael turns unprompted to another student—the *Cold Call* reminding everyone of the importance of listening to peers—and asks, “What's he talking about, Melanie?” subtly giving the first student credit for knowing something scientific after holding up under a challenging bout of inquiry.

You can see Melanie composing herself before she answers. It's going to be a challenge to put all of this into scientific terms but after steadying herself, she goes for it.

“He's talking about that, when you put another liquid substance in the water, that's … the atoms are moving faster, so in this case when it's hotter, the atoms are moving faster than the ones that are in the cold water.” Again we see the idea of elaboration at play here, retrieving an idea

---

<!-- Page 318 -->

from long-term into working memory but also connecting it and expanding upon it. It's long-term knowledge formation.

“Tell me more,” Michael says turning to yet another student. The *Cold Call* here seems part of the fun. The message to students is *We're being pushed to the limits*. Treated like working scientists; everybody's in the game of imagining ourselves in that setting.

“Atomic theory says that everything's made up of matter and the atoms in it,” the next student answers as the video closes—a small scene from a classroom marked by constant questions. No answer taken for granted. Always searching for why. Being in this classroom is like being a real scientist, in other words, and it just may be the kind of place that makes young people decide to pursue further studies in science.

When you give students ways to apply their knowledge in new settings, think on their feet, and tackle harder questions, they usually like it, at times quite a lot. This kind of questioning keeps them engaged and sends the message that we, their teachers, believe deeply their intellectual capability. *Stretch It* shows young people what they can do. You can almost see that in Melanie's response. She wonders for a moment, braces herself —she's beyond her comfort zone—but then she carries on and finds that she is up to the task. To find you can, over and over in the face of challenge, is to come to believe in yourself.

It's not just that students learn more in classrooms like Michael's and Arielle's; it's that, if you asked them, these would be those classrooms where they felt important as learners, valued and respected as students, most capable as thinkers. They're the places where young people rise to the challenge and start to think: *Yeah, I'm a math kid*, or *Yeah, science is my thing*. Many times, by challenging students, we tell them more about what we think they are

---

<!-- Page 319 -->

capable of than when we say, “I think you are smart. I think you are capable of science.” Kids want proof, and in these classes, they get it, seeing themselves succeeding in the face of real challenges.

What Arielle and Michael show us is that by treating correct answers as a step in the learning process, *Stretch It* can help students build long-term memory, expand and connect pieces of knowledge into cohesive schema, and build curiosity and confidence. The greater challenge brings about a cultural change.

*Stretch It* involves:
- Making a habit of asking follow-up questions in response to successful answers
- Asking a diversity of types of follow-up questions
- Building a culture around those interactions that causes students to embrace, and even welcome, the notion that learning is never done

## Other Advantages of *Stretch It*

*Stretch It* can often also help you learn more about student thinking and ensure the reliability of correct answers. In Jaheem’s case, for example, I read Arielle to be deliberately making sure he understood the initial answer he gave and why it was true, challenging him to accurately explain his correct response rather than accepting it at face value and moving to another student. This allows you to avoid false positives—moments when luck, coincidence, or partial mastery can lead you to believe that students have achieved a more complete understanding than they really have.

Further, in classes in which there isn’t necessarily one “correct” answer—analyzing complex literature, for

---

<!-- Page 320 -->

example, or formulating a hypothesis—*Stretch It* questions give students the opportunity to pursue their singular train of thought, supported by their teacher's authentic curiosity about their insights. *Stretch It* is an opportunity to demonstrate your interest in students' thinking (rather than simply accepting a student's response that aligns with your objective or exemplar) and thus create an academic culture in your class that values students' perspectives and thoughtful engagement with the content.

*Stretch It* can also help you solve one of the thorniest classroom challenges: differentiating instruction for students of different skill levels. Asking frequent, targeted, rigorous questions of students as they demonstrate mastery is a powerful and much simpler tool for differentiating than breaking students into different instructional groups. By tailoring questions to individual students, you can meet them where they are and push them in a way that's directly responsive to what they've shown they can already do.

## Varying Your Questions

In the next section, I describe six different categories of *Stretch It* questions. My purpose in doing so is to help teachers provide a rich and diverse range of ways to extend student thinking. Although there's value in categories, it's also important not to get too hung up on them. The categories are merely tools to help you think about how to bring variety to the important task of challenging students in the moment of success.

## Ask How or Why

The best test of whether students' answers are reliable—of whether they can get questions right consistently on a given topic—is whether they can explain how they arrived at the answer. Asking a student “why” can push them to

---

<!-- Page 321 -->

explore their own thinking and go beyond a “simply” accurate answer into new depths of insight or nuance. In his sixth-grade English classroom at Brooke East Boston, Rue Ratray stretched a student in this way during a discussion of a pivotal moment in *The Giver*:

**Teacher:** What can we infer about how Jonas's father feels about what he did?

**Student:** He didn't give much thought into what he did to the baby and he acted fine with it.

**Teacher:** Why?

**Student:** He was talking to the baby like he talked to Gabriel.

**Teacher:** Why?

**Student:** On the last sentence, it says, “a shrimp” and he's acting like this always happens, and he's talking to the baby in a baby voice.

## Ask for Another Way to Answer

Often there are multiple ways to answer a question. When students solve it one way, it's a great opportunity to make sure they can use all available methods. Arielle Hoo is essentially using this approach in her math class when she asks students to “solve algebraically” what they have understood from looking at a graph of the system of equations, and you can tell from Jaheem’s and other students' responses that they almost expect, having initially solved graphically, to be asked to solve via another method as a follow-up.

Alternatively, imagine a teacher is reviewing a short, written paragraph by a student about a scene in *A Raisin in the Sun* as she circulates around the classroom. The student has written:

---

<!-- Page 322 -->

Responding to Asagai, Beneatha says, “You didn't tell us what Alaiyo means … for all I know, you might be calling me Little Idiot or something.” This reveals her skepticism.

Her teacher might respond. “Nice choice of supporting evidence, now see if you quote Beneatha indirectly rather than directly.”

The student might then revise:

> Beneatha reveals her skepticism by asking Asagai what Alaiyo means and suggesting, perhaps with a hint of cynicism, that it might mean “Little Idiot.”

The teacher, circulating around the class a few minutes later, might follow up with a further Stretch It: “Nice change. How do you think it changed the argument to quote the play indirectly rather than directly?”

## Ask for a Better Word

Students often begin framing concepts in the simplest possible language. Offering them opportunities to use more specific words, as well as new words with which they are gaining familiarity, reinforces the crucial literacy goal of developing vocabulary. Pushing for the inclusion of vocabulary can also develop students' confidence in their thinking and support mastery of new words.

I mentioned regarding the video of Michael Towne's class that the first student to answer seemed to me to be anticipating Michael's follow-up question and deliberately using the most technical vocabulary he could. You could imagine a day previously where a student might have said, “The dye spreads faster in the warm water.” To which Michael might have said “Can you use a scientific term?” or “a term from our Knowledge Organizer,” or perhaps, “a more precise term for that idea.”

---

<!-- Page 323 -->

“The dye disperses.”

“Yes, thank you.”

Similarly you could imagine the day when a student said in Arielle's class: “The lines cross once.” And she said, “What's the technical term for that?” allowing the student to retrieve the term “intersect.” Students make a habit of using advanced vocabulary because teachers push them to. Once that becomes a habit they do it even when not promoted. They *self-stretch*.

This can also happen in nontechnical cases.

“How did Kika respond when she received the trophy?” a teacher might ask her students.

A student responding, “She smiled” would be correct, but the teacher might stretch her by asking: “Can you capture more of the feeling of her response in your word choice?” Or “Can you use one of our vocabulary words?”

Hopefully she'd then get a more powerful word, like “She beamed.”

If she got a response like “She smiled strongly” or “She had a broad smile on her face” the teacher might stretch again. “Yes, much better. Glory for you if you can capture ‘a broad smile’ in a single precise word. Can you?”

**Ask for Evidence**

By asking students to describe evidence that supports their conclusion, you emphasize the process of building and supporting sound arguments. In the larger world and in college, where right answers are not so clear and the cohesiveness of an argument is what matters, this will prove invaluable practice. You also avoid reinforcing weaker subjective interpretations, a task that is often challenging for teachers. You don't have to label an

---

<!-- Page 324 -->

argument as inadequate; instead ask for the proof and give the student an opportunity to reflect, refining her response and potentially revising herself.

You might ask students for evidence to support a student's assertion that Beneatha is struggling to express her identity in *A Raisin in the Sun*. Or for evidence of times when she seems more and less confident in what she believes. Or you might say, “Yes, I think that's true. But many people remark on the way she subtly changes in the course of the play. Can you find me some evidence to support or refute that reading?” Or perhaps, “Yes, I think that's true, but can you find me an example of how that struggle becomes more intense when her mother is present?”

## Ask Students to Integrate a Related Skill or Additional Knowledge

In the real world, questions rarely isolate a skill precisely. To prepare students for that, try responding to mastery of one skill by asking students to integrate the skill with others recently mastered.

*Teacher:* Who can use the word *stride* in a sentence?  
*Student:* “I stride down the street.”  
*Teacher:* Can you add some detail to show more about what *stride* means?  
*Student:* “I stride down the street to buy some candy at the store.”  
*Teacher:* Can you add an adjective to modify *street*?  
*Student:* “I stride down the wide street to buy some candy at the store.”  
*Teacher:* Good. Now, can you add a compound subject to your sentence?

---

<!-- Page 325 -->

Student: “My brother and I stride down the wide street to buy some candy at the store.”  
Teacher: And can you put that in the past tense?  
Student: “My brother and I strode down the wide street to buy some candy at the store.”  

For students to encode concepts in their long-term memory, they need to consolidate knowledge from multiple sources. *Stretch It* questions can help students practice this consolidation.  

Teacher: What might Bradbury be alluding to in this image?  
Student: Maybe a bomb that went off, destroying the whole town.  
Teacher: What do we know was happening in America at the time Bradbury was writing?  
Student: The United States ended World War II by dropping nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  
Teacher: So what might Bradbury be alluding to specifically?  
Student: This image might be an allusion to nuclear destruction, like what happened in Japan in 1945.  

**Ask Students to Apply the Same Skill in a New Setting**  

Once students have mastered a skill, consider asking them to apply it in a new or more challenging setting.  

Teacher: Which letters make up the digraph in the word “stop”?  
Student: “ST.”  
Teacher: Excellent. What word in this sentence contains a

---

<!-- Page 326 -->

digraph? “Last, he jumped.”  
*Student:* “Last.”  
*Teacher:* And what is the digraph?  
*Student:* “ST.”  

**Prompting**  
For the most part, the six types of *Stretch It* I've presented are directive: They guide students to think further *in a specific* way about something they've shown mastery of. Questions like “Can you give me a better word?” or “Can you tell me why?” and “How would the answer be different if the exponent was a zero?” shape the way students think about their original answer, and that's part of their strength. There are times, however, when it's also valuable to be nondirective. Prompting is a form of *Stretch It* that is nondirective, and the teacher's intervention is kept to an absolute minimum. Saying “Tell me more” or “Can you develop that?” doesn't tell a student how to think, merely to think further. Nondirective prompts allow students to decide what they think is most important to talk about and help students develop intellectual independence.

Prompting is often beneficial because it minimizes the disruption to a student's thinking. “Say more” comes faster and with less disruption to a student's train of thought than does a specific question about the author's purpose. It's easier for a student to immediately pick it up and develop it, so student thought remains center stage. As the buzzing of our electronic devices constantly proves, even a few seconds' distraction is enough to break the spell of deep thinking. The absolute simplicity of prompting is critical, and many of the ways we see champion teachers prompting are about minimizing interruption and shifting the ratio toward student thinking. Prompting is also helpful for those moments when you just need to know more about what a

---

<!-- Page 327 -->

student is thinking in order to know how to respond. A simple “tell us more” opens up the floor for them to expand on their idea without influencing the content, and gives you valuable data about what the student is able to understand independently and in what areas he or she may need additional support.

The most common type of prompting is the verbal variety, whereby a teacher vocally indicates that a student should continue developing a particular idea. Some typical examples include:

“Say more.”  
“Keep going.”  
“Develop.”  

As teachers make prompting a habit, they can begin to remove the verbal portion of the prompt and replace it with a nonverbal prompt, which yields the ultimate in minimal transaction cost. It's also the least directive type of Stretch It. Effective nonverbal prompts include:

- Making a rolling gesture with your hands, like the “traveling” signal in basketball  
- A head nod and/or sounds of encouragement (“Mmm hmm”)  
- Raised eyebrows or other distinctive facial gestures  

One caveat to offer on nondirective prompts is that while they clearly offer students more autonomy, and that can certainly be a very good thing, people often assume that increased autonomy always leads to increased rigor. It's not necessarily true that prompting a student with “Say more” is more rigorous than asking, “How is Langston Hughes's vision of internalized anger different from that of another

---

<!-- Page 328 -->

author we've read this semester?" In fact, the opposite is often true. The specificity of a good teacher's question is just as likely, if not more so, to result in rigorous thinking as a student's merely adding whatever was on her mind. (It may be helpful to state the obvious here that, of course, teachers will likely be more ready to respond with this kind of directive prompting if they've planned out the target response they are looking for, as discussed in technique 1, *Exemplar Planning*.) Answers that are left open to chance are, well, open to chance, which can mean high-or low-quality answers, answers that are relevant and useful for classmates to reflect on, and answers that are meandering or derail the class's progress toward an understanding.

Given the trade-offs between directive and nondirective forms of *Stretch It*, the best approach is probably to seek balance, in two ways: by using both directive and nondirective prompts or by combining the aspects of both approaches in semi-directive prompts. To do that, a teacher might use the “Say more” prompt, for example, but direct it to a specific part of the answer that she thought was most worthy of follow-up.

Let's say I ask my students how Jonas is feeling during a section of *The Giver* where he is experiencing both horrible and pleasurable feelings for the first time. A student replies, “Jonas is confused and feeling scared. He never felt any of this before, and he feels isolated.” One solution would be to say, “Tell me more about his confusion” or “Tell me more about why he feels isolated.” Now I'm giving my student significant autonomy, but still helping her see where the most productive part of her observation might be. This would be a semidirective prompt.

***

As you're probably starting to recognize, you could put a variety of *Stretch Its* on a spectrum to reflect their degree

---

<!-- Page 329 -->

of directness. Figure 4.1 arranges three different levels of prompting according to the degree of direction they offer.

It's important to see these possibilities as a spectrum, not a hierarchy. Sometimes the power of *Stretch It* lies in your capacity to shape the answer and steer students to the most important ideas and concepts. In other situations, the most important factor is a low transaction cost or a student's decision about what's worthy of further comment. There's a place for both directive and nondirective forms of *Stretch It*, and I suggest using all types. That said, where to strike the balance is a necessary question.

Part of finding that balance lies in recognizing the synergy between directive and nondirective versions of the technique. Asking lots of rigorous directive *Stretch It* questions is likely, over time, to teach students how to think more productively about developing their own answers. Then, when you stretch those students with less directive follow-ups, they're likely to do so, out of habit, in rigorous ways. This suggests that it may be worthwhile to invest time at the outset in directive questions, working in more nondirective prompts over time.

The type of question you're asking and the type of discussion you hope to have will also impact the balance of directive and nondirective versions of *Stretch It* you use in your classes. When you are eager for an array of answers—when exploring affective responses to a text, for example, or engaging in literary analysis that encompasses a range of plausible thinking—nondirective *Stretch It* prompts can yield a fascinating array of student thinking, perhaps even unearthing meaty insights you hadn't predicted. On the other hand, if there is a specific outcome you have planned for, the balance probably shifts in favor of more directive prompts. In short, you'll want to match the decision you make about the balance you strike among *Stretch It*

---

<!-- Page 330 -->

prompts to your objective. If you want students to understand how isolated Jonas feels, be more directive. If you want students to reflect on how Lowry's language reflects his isolation (or identify moments in which they empathize with Jonas's feelings of isolation), be less directive.

| Prompt—Nondirective | Prompt—Partially directive | Prompt—Directive |
|---------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| “And?”              | “Tell me more about the first part specifically.” | “What evidence tells you that?” |

Figure 4.1 Stretch It Prompts: Degree of Directedness

## Stretch It Loves Objectives

Let's assume you asked a student to add three and five. After she correctly gave you an answer of eight, you decided to Stretch It a bit and reward correct work with harder questions. Here are a number of ways you might stretch her:

“Good. What's 13 + 5?”  
“Good. What's 30 + 50?”  
“Good. What's 8 – 5?”  
“Good. What's 5 + 3?”  
“Good. What's 4 + 5?”  
“Good. Can you write me a story problem?”  
“Good. Can you show me how you know?”

These are all fine follow-ups to the original problem, but which one do you choose? With so many options for

---

<!-- Page 331 -->

stretching even a very simple question, how do you keep your stretching from becoming scattershot and haphazard? How do you keep your lessons from stretching all over the map?

Your being aware of a variety of types of questions can help you push yourself to be broad and diverse in the ways you challenge your students; at the same time, some strategic focus can help you ensure that your use of *Stretch It* accomplishes important, *objective-aligned goals* in your classroom.

Regardless of the type of question, it's always useful to remember lesson objectives. Although it's good to do some “lateral” stretching (that is, into new areas), and it's good to do some reinforcement stretching (that is, to keep skills students have mastered alive by circling back to them for occasional practice), reserve *most* of your *Stretch Its* for questions that align most closely to your objectives for that day or your current unit. This will help you keep the technique focused and productive.

**TECHNIQUE 18: FORMAT MATTERS**

There is no one right way to speak a language, especially one as polyglot and complex as English. This is manifested in the fact that nearly every speaker of English is in fact a speaker of “Englishes,” using different versions of the language depending on the setting: at work versus with friends or family, for example. Let me state directly, then: there is beauty and value in everyone's voice and in all our different ways of speaking.

Yet at the same time *teachers have a special responsibility no one else in society has*. We are tasked with developing students' mastery of a *particular* English.

---

<!-- Page 332 -->

It is the version of English in which almost every article, scientific study, legal brief, or memo is written. It is used before the court of appeals, in presentations to the board, among physicians during rounds.

Call it Standard English if you like. Some people don't like that name, but we have to call it something and the fact is that there is a vernacular your students must master if they are to be prepared to participate fully and equitably in civic and economic life.

It may anger you to know that someone might prejudge your students' ideas because they were not communicated in Standard English; perhaps you'd rather argue against accepting a standard form,³ but as teachers we must put those feelings aside. Or feel both things: love for our students and their forms of expression and also embrace the responsibility of ensuring that they are prepared to speak the language of the professions with fluency. School is the institution that provides students with the opportunity to master those language forms. If it does not, then full access to opportunity will accrue only to those whom privilege or happenstance prefers.⁴

“Pretending that gatekeeping points don't exist is to ensure that many students will not pass through them,” Lisa Delpit writes. “To imply to children or adults that it doesn't matter how you talk or how you write is to ensure their ultimate failure.”⁵

Delpit calls language a “game,” with rules students must learn to play by. I might opt to call it a convention,⁶ one that we inherit and that changes more slowly than society,⁷ but whatever you call it, we have a responsibility to prepare students to master it. As the teacher and writer Jasmine Lane observes, “School is a place of preparation, a place where you learn the codes of the mainstream not

---

<!-- Page 333 -->

necessarily because the mainstream is better ... but because if you want to make significant changes to any systems, you have to be able to first get in by the gatekeepers' standards.”⁸

Some people worry that this will cause students to feel like they or their own forms of language are somehow inferior, but why assume that? Would you presume as much about yourself? If you moved to England (or if you are English, if you moved to the United States), you would start speaking differently in certain public settings; do you imagine that you would lose your sense of identity and self-worth? I suspect you would remain very much you despite adapting your language habits in some settings. Our students are strong; why think them less capable than ourselves of making language choices without a loss of identity? If you are worried that some might feel their own language implicitly undervalued, it is certainly something you can address as a teacher. Writing about her own experience in school, Lane observes that she never felt learning to use language differently was a rejection of who she was, “I just needed someone to explicitly teach me the importance of both [ways of using language].”

Our job, in other words, is to teach students—with sensitivity, nuance, and judgment—to master Standard English. For some, our classrooms may be their only chance to learn it. And the best way to do this is to build verbal and written habits. *When we are in the classroom* we shift to a mode of discourse that ensures consistent and sustained exposure to the standard form so that all students will be able to use it naturally and effortlessly.⁹

I’ll begin by describing the *what* of *Format Matters*, but I’ll also discuss the *how*—an issue that is equally important.

There are four specific actions I think teachers can take within *Format Matters*:

---

<!-- Page 334 -->

1. **Grammatical format** involves asking students to phrase (or rephrase) their answers in Standard English.
2. **Complete sentence format** involves asking students to expand answers into full phrases or complete sentences to ensure they get extensive oral practice at sentence and complex syntax formation.
3. **Audible format** involves reminding students to speak audibly. The value of students' ideas is undercut if no one can hear them.
4. Finally I propose an idea called **Collegiate format**. Informed by Basil Bernstein's research on elaborated code, the idea is to prepare students for some of the particular demands of college and university by pushing for comfort not just with “Standard English” but the form of language, more formal and distinctive still, frequently encountered in an academic setting.

## Grammatical Format

When students make grammatical errors (that is, variations from Standard) in class, they are often unconscious of them. Our goal should be to help them to hear when this happens and know how to correct the errors.10 They will be able to assess them themselves. And we want them to build habits so that when they are in the classroom Standard English comes to them naturally. An understanding of working memory tells us that if students have to consciously translate while they are speaking, the effort required to do so will interfere with other uses for working memory. We want our students to not have to use up scarce working memory thinking about how to say something so that it can instead be focused on thinking and perceiving.

If habit is the goal, then it is not enough just to tell a student that they have made an error; it's better to ask

---

<!-- Page 335 -->

them to fix it. In this way their learning isn't much different from what we might experience learning sports or music. Coaches and music teachers will quickly recognize that offering a critique—telling a young person that they need to face the basket or that a note needs to be played more quietly—will not be nearly as effective as giving them a chance to correct and build fluent memory of the desired outcome: “Try that again and let me see you square up to the basket before you shoot” or “Let me hear you play that again but play that last note gently.” It's the doing that builds the habit.

Building a habit also implies a fair amount of frequency and consistency in correcting, and that can be a challenge. Must you correct every single time you hear nonstandard usage? Of course not. There's a delicate balance to be struck. It may be worth skipping a correction in the middle of an especially profound thought, or at least delaying the correction until the thought is compete. Better to wait until after a student says, “We was discussing the ironic nature of a law that says it protects people by taking away their rights,” to say, “Interesting, can you start, ‘We were ... ’” than to interrupt the thought and risk its never being completed. It's hard to keep two things in working memory at once. There's always the risk that thinking about the correction can drive the sentence you sought to improve out of working memory. And certainly there are times when you'll want to be careful not to suggest that your first thought on hearing a student's heartfelt thought was: “Oh, subject-verb agreement.”

Correcting a few times early in class—before you get to the deepest thinking and when you can remind students early of the expectations—is often especially effective.

You'll also want to explain to students what you're going to do and why in advance so they understand it. That means a

---

<!-- Page 336 -->

brief rollout speech, perhaps something like this: “I’ll often help you identify how to say it in the language that college and the workplace will expect of you. How you speak in your lives outside the classroom is beautiful to me, but my job is to help you learn a specific version of the language so you are ready for the world. So I’ll often tell you how to say things in Standard English. When I do, do your best to fix it but know that I’m never judging you. I speak differently outside these four walls too.”

As this rollout suggests, it’s important that corrections be kept judgment-free—our goal is to prepare students for the world while reinforcing their faith in themselves and their ability. In *Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain*, Zaretta Hammond reminds us to make sure that language correction is “instructive feedback” that helps learners focus on making “specific adjustments.” It should always be “timely” and “delivered in a low-stress environment” rather than evaluative.

So the goal is to find simple techniques to identify and correct errors with minimum distraction. Two simple methods are especially helpful:

1. *Identify the error.* When a student makes a grammatical error, merely repeat the error in a gently interrogative tone. You can watch Darryl Williams do this in the video *Darryl Williams: Has to Be*. “It gets to be?” Darryl asks when a student uses that phrase. He then allows the student to self-correct—he’s previously explained that they should plan to correct if he points out an error.

2. *Begin the correction.* When a student makes a grammatical error, begin to rephrase the answer, then allow the student to complete it. In the second example in the video, Darryl begins, “It has …” leaving the

---

<!-- Page 337 -->

student to provide the full correct answer. This version is useful if you try identifying the error and your student fails to self-correct.

Remember to exercise discretion. *There will be times to let the sentence be completed and not step in right away.* If you're doing work where students are expressing especially strong opinions or thoughts, you'll probably want to let them finish their thought before correcting. And there will of course be times not to step in at all.

In *Motivated Teaching*, Peps Mccrea points out the risk that good ideas can become lethal adaptations if teachers aren't careful about how they use them. Often this is true of the most important tools we have, and *Format Matters* is no exception. The most important part of the technique is tone. Students have to know that we care about them, value their ideas, and still have a responsibility to shape their communication habits. Be humane and gracious but also not apologetic. Notice that Darryl doesn't make a fuss about his decision to correct. Sometimes being matter-of-fact draws less attention to a correction and suggests its normalcy.

## Complete Sentence Format

A *notion*, a professor of mine once argued, is a fragment of an idea, an impression, belief, or opinion not yet fully formed in your mind. Only when you put it into words does it finally become an idea. Before it has been encapsulated in language, it is not fully formed. You know you feel something, but you don't yet know what it is until it becomes a string of words. “Language,” as the poet W. H. Auden put it, “is the mother, not the handmaiden of thought.”

---

<!-- Page 338 -->

Our facility with the process of wrestling ideas into words and syntax helps (or limits) their creation. One definition of a sentence is “a complete thought,” which reminds us that sentence creation is therefore complete-thought formation and surely one of a handful of the most critical skills for any student.

Given that, it's a gift to students to give them lots of practice building complete sentences—in spoken as well as written discourse, upon reflection, and on the spur of the moment. A student's truncated answer—in a single word or a fragment of a phrase—in other words, can often be an opportunity to practice using and developing fluency with the syntactic forms that will shape their thoughts for the rest of their lives.

You can start by simply asking for a complete sentence, either *after* a truncated answer, as in:

Teacher: James, what's the setting of the novel?  
James: Oakland, California.  
Teacher: Yes, good … and in a sentence?  
James: The setting of the novel is Oakland, California, in 1968.

Or before the answer is given:

Teacher: Who can tell me in a complete sentence what the setting of the story is?

Notice in the first example that the teacher has *praised the thinking* ("Yes, good") before asking for a revision. This is an easy way to keep the tone positive and underscore that practicing sentence formation is not a judgment on the answer. A smile helps make this point too.

You'll notice, too, in the example that James adds a bit more information (he includes the year 1968). Of course that

---

<!-- Page 339 -->

won't always happen. But often when you ask for a slightly more elaborated answer or a more formal form of expression students sense the expectation and willingly add more details.

Alternatively, you could challenge James by suggesting an interesting way to start the sentence, ideally one that uses challenging syntax:

*Teacher:* James, what's the setting of the story?  
*James:* Oakland, California.  
*Teacher:* Good. Can you tell me again starting, “The novel is set …”  
*James:* The novel is set in Oakland, California, in 1968.

Again the teacher here has praised the thinking before asking for a revision, but the revision has also caused James to use “set” as a verb. This involves taking a noun and turning it into a verb—a challenging task—and applying usage that is less common verbally than in writing. Both are likely to help expand students' syntactic control.

You can see this play out in the video *Jasmine Howard: Unique Output*. Jasmine asks a student to define a function. “It has an output and it's unique,” the student replies. Her answer is largely correct. At least it is if you make some assumptions about what her pronouns refer to, so Jasmine pushes her to clarify:

“‘It has its own output and it's unique,’ she repeats.  
‘What's the ‘it’?’  
‘The input,’ her student replies, and Jasmine now asks for a complete sentence with an encouraging tone and demeanor that affirms the answer: “Go ahead and say that in a complete sentence.” In other words, she's asking her

---

<!-- Page 340 -->

student to embed the second answer in the original answer and express them as a complete thought.

“Every input in a function has a unique output,” her student says. She's not just demonstrated understanding, she's practiced creating an elegant and concise expression of a complex idea in the midst of discussion and she’s further specified her point in adding the word “every” of her own accord.

In another interaction she asks a student, “Is this a linear function?”

“Yes,” the student replies.

“Why?”

“Because it forms a straight line.”

“All right. Say it in a complete sentence and do not use ‘it,’” Jasmine replies. This requires the support of a classmate who ultimately arrives at: “The equation represents a linear function because the points are in a straight line on a graph.”

I hope it's not necessary to add that an argument in favor of frequent practice at sentence formation is not an argument for reflexively asking for answers in complete sentences. As always, judgment applies. Too much of a good thing can make it a bad thing. But please don't overlook the influence of oracy—the ability to express oneself clearly, fluently, and grammatically in speech. Elegant and concise expressions of a complex idea offered in the midst of discussions, along the lines of what Jasmine's student creates, make a student stand out in a class and feel the confidence to express her ideas.

Further, as I discuss elsewhere, it is important to recognize that the data is sadly clear: students read less and less, and the trend is going in the wrong direction. Reading is in a

death struggle against the smartphone and it is losing. Given that written text uses a much wider range of not just vocabulary but also syntax than spoken language, one of the many ways this is relevant is that students are less frequently exposed to those forms of language. Allowing for more intentional use of elaborated and elevated syntax in your classroom can help to bridge at least some of the resulting gap.

## Audible Format

Take a moment to watch the brief segment of discussion about Lois Lowry's novel *Number the Stars* in the second half of the video *Christine Torres: Keystone*. Then watch the clip *Christine Torres: Loud and Proud*, which shows the influence of Christine asking students to speak audibly. In this clip you can see her reinforcement of the expectation during the discussion as well as during a series of moments earlier in the lesson. These results are striking. Students express themselves with confidence as if their ideas were valuable, and their classmates hear them clearly and all the nuances of what they say. The rich discussion you hear comes about in part because of this. Students hear arguments clearly and expressed as if they matter and respond accordingly. Combined with *Habits of Attention* (technique 48) and *Habits of Discussion* (technique 44), this sews the fabric of a culture where people listen to each other, value ideas, and thus speak honestly and openly with confidence.

None of this would happen if, when called upon, Christine's students mumbled or muttered so that other people in the room could not hear them.

There's not much point in discussing ideas with people who can't hear them, in other words; a classroom where marginally audible statements are common suggests that

---

<!-- Page 342 -->

the ideas expressed in those statements don't matter very much. And it's hard to make listening well an expectation unless speakers are audible. If it matters enough to say in class, it matters that everyone can hear it.

Perhaps the most effective way to reinforce the expectation of audibility is with a quick, crisp reminder that creates the minimum distraction from the business of class. Christine uses the phrase *loud and proud*. She's consistent and her implementation shows clearly her respect for students. You can hear this in the additional reinforcement Christine occasionally gives. She is warm, supportive, and occasionally playful, but always insistent on excellence:

> To Mark: “Go for it. Loud and proud. Boom it.”

> To Jasmine: “Louder, you got this, girl.”

> To Didi: “Loud, girl!”

> To Jovon: “Louder and prouder, 'cuz you got this.”

> Again to Jovon: “Pause. Jovon. You got this. Match my voice …”

There are other phrases you might use. Just make sure that what you choose is quick and consistent (always preferable to distracting or disruptive), and heed Zaretta Hammond's advice that corrections of this sort should be “instructive and actionable rather than evaluative.” You can see this over and over in Christine's class. The explicit or implicit message is: your words matter; share them with us so we can hear. “Voice” or “with voice, please” is a good simple and noninvasive option. It might work better, depending on your setting and style—“loud and proud” probably wouldn't work well in a high school classroom, for example.

You can observe a further example for audible format in the video *Gabby Woolf: Keystone*. As Gabby reviews a

---

<!-- Page 343 -->

challenging section of *Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde* to ensure that all students understood the key events, Imran answers the question and Gabby reminds the class, “Good. Can we keep voice loud, please.” She's reinforced this not when Imran's answer was inaudible but as it slipped toward quiet. Catching it early is better, when a reminder will do rather than a correction. Moments later, Ahmed answers and Gabby reminds students again, “Keep your voices loud, please.” Her tone is clear but without pique. Notice that she addresses her comments to the whole class as well, ensuring the universality of the reminder and diffusing any criticism Ahmed or Imran might feel. This too is easier to do when you are reminding students before voices have actually become inaudible. Once they have you'll have to ask the speaker to repeat and draw far more attention to him.

Reinforcing audible format is best when introduced by a rollout in which you explain to students what you'll do and why. You might consider language like “What you have to say is important, so everyone should be able to hear it.” Students may feel uncomfortable at first, so the reinforcement of the purpose behind the expectation is essential in helping them embrace the challenge and contribute audibly to the learning community. So is a bit of warmth as you begin reinforcing the expectation so students understand that it comes from your faith and caring for them. This is evident in Gabby's teaching and in Christine's, where the upbeat tone is as noteworthy as her persistence.

## Collegiate Format

Watch the interaction between Beth Verrilli and her student Ashanti in the video *Beth Verrilli: Hither*. Students are reading a scene from Shakespeare where Lady Macbeth

---

<!-- Page 344 -->

seeks to inspire her husband to ruthless ambition. (Note the beautiful oral reading by Jennifer.)

“What's she going to do when he gets home?” Beth asks, to which Ashanti replies: “She's gonna talk all this evil stuff in his ear.” Which is true and shows a strong understanding of Shakespeare's play, and frankly of Lady Macbeth.

But how would that response play in a college class just a semester or two on in a student's journey? It might work fine. Her classmates and her professor might love the easy casual wisdom of she's gonna talk all this evil stuff in his ear. They might even try to use a bit of it themselves in their own answers; it's fun to capture the essence of Shakespeare so casually, as if it were easy. But Ashanti will also need to write a paper using more academic language She’ll have to be able to sit in the professor's office chatting about Lady Macbeth's “insidious influence on her husband's worldview.” It’s fine to use informal discourse if you know you can shift it up a level or two when you need to.

College and university are settings where words matter and elevated formal discourse is at times expected. No one tells you that explicitly. In fact they will sometimes pretend otherwise but this is only hiding the keys—keeping the secret to themselves. Your ability to shift into such forms of discourse, to frame ideas in precise words or elevated or new words—or frankly sometimes the ability to frame tired and rehashed ideas in new words—is part of the unspoken code of success. These are the forms of language that mark one's expertise in and mastery of a profession—whether anyone tells you that or not.

So consider the value in what happens next. “In AP language, she's gonna talk all this evil stuff in his ear …” Beth says, directing the question back to Ashanti.

---

<!-- Page 345 -->

“She's going to try to impose her negative beliefs onto Macbeth,” Ashanti explains.

Ashanti's first answer was in many ways just as good. In some settings it might have been better. Notice that Beth is clearly expressing appreciation of Ashanti's original answer. She's merely helping her ensure that she's also ready to prove her bona fides by taking it up a level if she needs to. Her request for elevated discourse suggests the quality she sees in Ashanti's thinking.

Collegiate Format, in other words, refers to moments when teachers cause students to practice elevating their discourse and allows them to express their belonging and readiness to contribute in even the most advanced contexts.

# TECHNIQUE 19: WITHOUT APOLOGY

The belief that students can't do an assignment or that content will be too difficult or uninteresting to students can slip unintended into our classrooms ... and mindsets. *Without Apology* offers reminders of some ways that can happen and some language that can be useful in preventing it.

## Apologies for Content

When I returned to campus at Hamilton College after studying abroad my junior year, every other class in my major was full except *British Romantic Poets* with Patricia O'Neil. There could not have been a topic less compelling. I imagined a semester of highbrow recitations on the nature of love, but I needed the credit for my major, and so I walked reluctantly and, if I am honest, a little sullenly into the single best class I took in college.

---

<!-- Page 346 -->

Adeyemi Stembridge points out that a passionate teacher can be the link between student and content, that the teacher's purpose is to model and foster a relationship with the content. So it was that Professor O'Neil somehow convinced me that it was urgent to stay up late reading William Wordsworth and permanently changed the way I think and read. There were classes I took that I knew I would love, but Professor O'Neil managed to inspire me with content that, with my comprehensive nineteen-year-old wisdom, I was sure was irrelevant to me. I suspect most people have had a similar experience, finding that the subject that seemed least interesting came to life in the hands of a gifted teacher.

There is no such thing as boring content, in other words, only content that is waiting for you to bring it to life, to find a way in. In the hands of a great teacher, the material students need to master is exciting, interesting, and inspiring, even if we sometimes doubt that we can make it so. If nothing else, there is always the pleasure of rising to a challenge.

I often hear this argument about book choice: let students choose what they like and they will love reading. That's often fine for independent reading but only by reading the same book can all of us discuss and understand our different perspectives on a given story. Someone is not going to get their choice. Perhaps no one will. And just maybe that's a good thing. It is folly to imagine that an eleven-year-old or a fourteen-year-old knows enough about the options available to know fully what they like. The whole point is to expand young people's horizons, not accept them, and reinscribe them in permanent marker. The more you prove to a fourteen-year-old that his or her knowledge of the world is as yet imperfect, the better. The same child thinks they do not like a certain cuisine because they have not tasted it cooked by an expert. The gift, in

---

<!-- Page 347 -->

fact, is in part learning that what you love may surprise you.

Nor does merely shifting to content that we think will speak to students make a culturally responsive classroom. The foundations of teaching must make the classroom a warm, vibrant, inclusive place that tells students their learning is important. Meaningful teaching helps students feel a sense of belonging in the classroom and connection to the content. As Zaretta Hammond writes, it is “simplistic to think that students who feel marginalized, academically abandoned or invisible in the classroom would reengage simply because we mention tribal kings of Africa or Aztec empires of Mexico.”

## Assuming Something Will Be Boring Is a Big Assumption

We often presume that students will find something boring. Think for a moment about accounting, for example. The epitome of boring, right? And yet there are thousands of accountants who love their job and find it fascinating; who read books about accounting for pleasure. They follow fascinating accountants on social media. Perhaps we assume accounting is boring because we don't know much about it. Perhaps we fail to account for variability in tastes. Someone loves every food that you despise and vice versa. Saying something like, “Guys, I know this is kind of dull. Let's just try to get through it” or even “You may not find this all that interesting” as a way of getting students through a topic is apologizing—it's assuming it will be boring to others—and perhaps a bit defensive: If I tell you I don't like it, then if you don't like it, you'll know it's not my fault. You won't think it's me that's boring.

A belief that content is boring is a self-fulfilling prophecy. No one lights a lesson on fire when they've just announced

---

<!-- Page 348 -->

it's no fun. And yet there are teachers who make great and exciting and inspiring lessons out of every topic that some other teacher considers a grind. Our job is to find a way to make what we teach engaging and never to assume that students can't appreciate what's not instantly familiar or does not egregiously pander to them.

## “They’ll Like It” Can Be Superficial

Just as our reasons for assuming students won't like something can be superficial, so can our reasons for assuming they will. Rudine Sims-Bishop observes that lesson content provides “views of worlds that may be real or imagined, familiar or strange.” She uses the analogy of mirrors and windows. In a mirror I see myself reflected. In a window I see a different world brought to life. All students deserve and respond to both. For example, as Sims-Bishop points out, “children from dominant social groups … too have suffered from the lack of availability about books about others. They need books that will help them understand the multicultural nature of this world.” And it's also true that students of color are just as likely to be moved and inspired by Shakespeare's words as any other students. “All texts belong to all students,” writes Alfred Tatum. Shakespeare—like Morrison, like Marquez, like Neruda, like Hurston, like Murakami—belongs to everyone.

But there is perhaps a tendency to presume that the mirror will be more engaging than the window, to assume that students will only want to see themselves in content, just as many may be inspired by books or lessons about people of different backgrounds from their own. For some, interest and identity align to the terms by which we see them (“I am Latina”). To others it is less visible (“I am a scientist”). A just school is a school in which every child gains the fullest opportunity to pursue their dreams. We have to stay open

---

<!-- Page 349 -->

to the wide variety of their dreams. Some students will find inspiration in Malcolm X and some in Gregor Mendel. We—and, honestly, they—will never know which is going to be which. When it comes to windows and mirrors, every student should have both.

## Blaming the Context

A teacher who assigns the responsibility for the appearance of content in her class to some outside entity—the administration, state officials, or some abstract “they”—starts with two strikes: she is undercutting the content’s validity to students and eroding her own enthusiasm for teaching it. The blaming might sound like this: “This material is on the test, so we’ll have to learn it” or “They say we have to read this, so …” The negativity here is a self-fulfilling prophecy and also a bit lacking in perspective: if it’s “on the test,” it’s also probably part of the school’s curriculum or perhaps your state standards. You’re never going to agree completely with anyone’s judgment on what gets included in the curriculum and standards, but it’s just possible that the (also smart) people who put it there had a good rationale for putting it there. Reflecting on that rationale can be a good place to start: “We’re going to study this because it’s an important building block for things you do throughout your life as a student.”

## Loving Challenge

Carol Dweck’s important work on growth mindset has been widely discussed and applied—sometimes well and sometimes poorly. At its core it reminds us that the fact that something is challenging is a good thing. A willingness to embrace challenge may well cause us to learn more. It certainly prepares us for life’s difficulties. So a tiny shift from “I’m sorry, this is going to be hard” to “This is going to be really challenging (and that’s a good thing)” can help.

---

<!-- Page 350 -->

Here are some phrases that can help turn apology into opportunity:

- “This topic is great because it's really challenging!”
- “Lots of people don't understand this until they get to college, but you'll know it now. Cool.”
- “This gets more and more exciting as you come to understand it better.”
- “A lot of people are afraid of this stuff, so after you've mastered it, you'll know more than most adults.”
- “There's a great story behind this!”

## Apologies for Students

At the first school I helped found, students learned Mandarin Chinese as their foreign language. None were Chinese and many were English Language learners. They were a polyglot of every background culture and color. Knowing how difficult Mandarin is—the tens of thousands of Hanzi, the four tones that cause words to take on new meanings, the simplified and complex alphabets—many outsiders, a few staff members, and even many parents, responded, “How in the world are they going to learn Chinese?” The principal at the time calmly responded that if they'd been born in China, they'd learn Chinese. And so we started. And so they learned. Often with great pride and success. The first step was to believe.

“As educators we have to recognize that we help maintain the achievement gap when we don't teach advanced cognitive skills to students,” writes Zaretta Hammond. We stand at risk of serving students poorly when we “underestimate what disadvantaged students are intellectually capable of [and] postpone more challenging

and interesting work until we think they have mastered the basics.”

Sticking with kids, telling them you're sticking with them, and constantly delivering the message “I know you can” raises a student's self-perception. Here are some phrases that can help frame challenge when you present it to students:

- “This is one of the things you're going to take real pride in knowing.”
- “When you're in college, you can show off how much you know about ...”
- “Don't be rattled by this. There are a few new words, but once you know them, you'll have this down.”
- “This is tricky. But I haven't seen much you couldn't do if you put your minds to it.”
- “I know you can do this. So I'm going to stick with you on this question.”
- “It's OK to be confused the first time through this, but we're going to get it, so let's take another try.”

## Notes

1. Tone and praise are also age-related variables. This means that if you teach kindergarten, make a fuss over every tiny moment. If you teach tenth grade, go a bit easy.

2. This is one of a hundred reasons why behavioral culture matters. It is not enough to eliminate negative behaviors. We have to install and instill learning-positive behaviors among students so the classroom culture supports changes in behavior that benefit young people. Please

remember this moment when you read Chapters Ten through Twelve.

3. I’ve seen several critiques of the idea of reinforcing standard grammar and syntax in school. Several found my argument oppressive or offensive. For what it’s worth, they were all written in impeccable Standard English.

4. Consider for a moment recent articles about the increasing importance of college essays in an era of growing SAT optionality. Ask yourself whether you would consider it an advantage or a disadvantage for your own child’s college essay to be written without mastery of Standard English.

5. *Other People’s Children* (New Press, 1995), pp. 39-40.

6. It’s also possible that it is an inevitability—are there languages in the world where there is not a standard form that must be learned, where “rules,” often passed down and therefore feeling archaic to some, do not need to be followed? If there are, they are rarely written languages. Rules, after all, are the purpose of grammar.

7. Often for legitimate reasons. One benefit of the slowing influence on linguistic change via standardized grammar is that it sustains our access to older texts and ideas. Spelling was far less standardized before the publication of Johnson’s first dictionary in 1755. Reading texts written before that where spelling is unpredictable is extremely challenging.

9. Am I just talking about adjustments in discourse for certain Black and Brown kids? I am not. To varying degrees, learning to use the standard form is an issue across the majority of young people in society. Part of standardization is not about cultural but about generational differences. Young people speak like young people and their parents want schools to ensure that they can speak in a way that is more like how the adults talk. Any student's language habits, in other words, are informed by a combination of influences and factors and it may be a false judgment to assume that a teenager's way of speaking is a representation of his or her culture. For all you know it makes their parents crazy. Most of us went through a process as teenagers of learning to speak in a way that was accessible to the broadest swath of society.

10. This then is something they can choose not to do if they wish; we are empowering choice.
