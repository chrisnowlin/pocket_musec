# Chapter 6
## Pacing

I recently observed Sadie McCleary's Chemistry lesson at West Guilford High School in Greensboro, North Carolina. (You can see footage of Sadie's lesson in the video *Sadie McCleary: Keystone*.) Her topic was particle motion, pressure, and the compound gas law and the lesson was bursting with focused, productive energy. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty minutes raced by as Sadie engaged the whole room in rigorous, thoughtful work that in another classroom might have felt like a slog.

As a timer went off signifying the end of the *Do Now*, students finished writing and Sadie began a quick review, via *Cold Call*, reminding students that they should know relationships between volume, pressure, and temperature by heart. Students who were called on were ready right on cue and those not called on checked and corrected their answers. Her language was clear and precise: “You should have gotten 120 liters. Give me a thumbs-up if you’ve got that. Great.”

She transitioned seamlessly into a *Turn and Talk*, asking students to explain what happened to the pressure of a gas as temperature increased in a fixed container. After ending the *Turn and Talk* warmly and crisply (“Pause where you are”) she *Cold Called* Sterling, whose response was clear, concise, and accurate. “Beautiful,” said Sadie. “That was excellently said.”

Next, she gave students a new problem to consider: How would temperature and volume change when pressure increased in an elastic container? “Tell your partner. Go!”

<!-- Page 437 -->

she said. Students immediately began discussing in pairs, and Sadie listened in on a conversation at the front table.

As the energy of discussion showed its first signs of ebbing, she paused the class and *Cold Called* one student then another to explain the answer. After a succinct and well-stated response (complete with “shine” for both students from their peers), Sadie moved on to a new question. Students shared once again with their partners.

Students then quickly took out their notebooks for notes on a new topic: the Combined Gas Law.

The rest of the lesson was of a piece. Students constantly engaged in rigorous thinking in a variety of formats: taking notes, chatting with a partner, answering questions from Sadie as she checked for understanding. The activities changed with some frequency but tasks were always clear, and always clearly distinguishable from the task before. There was energy and momentum: change and novelty in how students engaged, but consistent focus on the lesson topic.

The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi coined the term “flow” to refer to a mental state in which a person performing an activity is so immersed in it that they begin to lose their sense of time. We've all had that happen: You look up and suddenly class (or practice or rehearsal) is almost over. You'd thought it had just begun! Flow states happen most often when people are highly absorbed in a task that involves a significant degree of ongoing mental stimulation. Discussions of the theory of flow often note the happiness it brings participants. To lose yourself in the work of some task is not just productive, it's gratifying.

This offers a reminder that people mostly want to be positively and productively engaged, and that students are often frustrated when they enter a classroom and realize it

<!-- Page 438 -->

will not be that way. Csikszentmihalyi's chosen name for this state, flow, underscores that it is connected somehow to a perception of motion, of steady forward momentum, and this is something you could feel keenly that day in Sadie's classroom.

Teachers frequently use the term *pacing* to describe the aspects of Sadie's lesson that gave it forward motion, but the underlying idea is difficult to pin down. It has something to do with momentum, but pacing can't just be a synonym for how fast you go through content. While Sadie moved quickly from one question to the next, the class never felt rushed; in fact, while it seemed like things were always changing, Sadie stayed focused on just one or two topics.

There's something ironic there. The work of teaching and learning can feel fast when you're moving slowly—and it can feel slow when you're moving fast. Sometimes you're working on problem after problem, for example, determining the slope of a line or deep-reading just a few paragraphs of *To Kill a Mockingbird*, but there's energy crackling in the air. Sometimes you're discussing three chapters on the American Revolution, but the minutes tick slowly away, and students stare blankly. We sometimes assume that a plodding lesson results from our overall choice of methodology: “You shouldn't lead the review; you should let them review!” But the desperate slowing of the classroom clock can just as likely happen in a less traditional setting. Who hasn't found themselves fanning barely smoldering interest during a “student-led discussion” they had assumed would excite students?

So pacing is different from the speed at which you cover content and it's not necessarily about methodology. It's more like your students' perception of progress as you teach, that is, *the illusion of speed*. A teacher with strong

---

<!-- Page 439 -->

pacing creates a perception of rapid progress when they want students to feel as though they are “moving.” And they balance that with times when they'd prefer a pace that feels slower and more reflective.

The architecture of the human brain is full of paradoxes, many of them created by tens of thousands of years of evolutionary refinement for an environment not quite like the one we currently live in. We know that attention and staying on task yield long-term learning, for example. “The big rewards,” cognitively speaking, accrue from “sustained, focused effort,” notes McGill University cognitive psychologist Daniel J. Levitin. And yet our brains are also wired for “novelty bias,” and are “easily hijacked by something new.”¹ “Humans will work just as hard to obtain a novel experience as we will to get a meal or a mate,”² Levitin writes. Gratifying the “novelty-seeking portion of the brain” induces a “feeling of pleasure.”³ We are drawn to distraction because it was often critical to survival, Maryanne Wolf points out in *Reader, Come Home*. In the long arc of pre-history, attending to a new stimulus right away meant you were ready when something burst out of the thicket, teeth bared. We evolved accordingly. Novelty bias is the term for the special attention we give to what is new.

And novelty bias, many readers will know, is the design principle behind the smartphone's hold over all of us, but Sadie's teaching harnesses it in a beneficial and balanced way. Her students are always focused on the content, but her ability to achieve the right rate of novelty at the same time draws students in and engages them. She creates strategic novelty; new and ever-changing ways of engaging that keep the focus on the same material all the way through the lesson. When you peer behind the curtain, the first ten minutes are just a series of pressure, temperature,

---

<!-- Page 440 -->

and volume problems, but shifting the format of the way students interact with the problems at just the right rate—from *Turn and Talk* to *Cold Call* to (later) note-taking—maximizes engagement and attention. Perhaps the optimal balance of these things is the source of “flow.”

The keys to pacing, then, often lie in mastering both students' perception of time and the tension between attention and novelty. Sadie's switches between activities (from writing to *Turn and Talk*, say) were invariably crisp, so students never lost focus. A long and highly narrated transition might disrupt the ideas they were holding in working memory, but careful attention to the transitions ensures that important ideas are sustained in working memory even when activities change. Clear, bright lines between activities contribute in other ways, too. Because the end of one activity and the beginning of the next are so distinct, it makes novelty, the introduction of a new activity, easier to see. And what's more, students can sense their own progress as they move from one task to another. This, too, is motivating. Here's an analogy: driving your car at 60 miles per hour on the interstate does not feel fast. Your experience is one of continued sameness—a smudge of trees or houses in the distance and the consistency of an unbroken stretch of guardrail. But drive at that rate on a narrow road or in a settled neighborhood and you suddenly feel like you are racing along. The smudge of houses in the distance becomes, in fact, one house and then another and then another. When you distinguish them each whipping past, they become like mileposts that indicate to you that something has come and gone. They create an illusion that multiplies your perception of your own progress. A teacher like Sadie often does something similar: the more she creates mileposts, the more her students realize a new task has come and gone, and she uses this to enhance the influence of novelty bias.

---

<!-- Page 441 -->

In this chapter, I'll discuss ways to capture and manage the kind of momentum you can see in Sadie's class. Because you sometimes need to stick with an activity for a longer period of time, I'll also describe some tools to frame activities (slow or fast) so that you can be more effective at helping students get lost in rigorous work (and lose track of the passage of time), regardless of how long you actually spend on an activity.

The tools of pacing can be broken into two groups. The first involves varying the *types* of activities your students engage in during a lesson, the goal being to cause dynamic changes in student thinking and participation by engaging them in different ways. The second set of skills involves managing activities and the *transitions* between them to ensure clear, decisive, and noticeable shifts—the illusion of speed. Many of these tools deal in perception—managing the illusion of speed, maximizing mileposts by making beginnings and endings visible so that students are more aware of the changes around them.

A final note: Generally, speed is exciting and change is interesting, but as with most good things it's best in moderation and balance, so it's useful also to think of the limits of speed. My colleague Chi Tschang once mentioned that too much passivity wasn't the only way students could get distracted. “If there are two (or three) highly active kinesthetic activities in a row, the class's energy level can shoot off the charts, and kids can lose focus.” Too much speed can be as problematic as not enough. The goal is balance. And the good news is that the tools of pacing can often make what you choose to do feel dynamic and engaging, even when at its core, it's reflective, deliberate, methodical, and even slow.

# TECHNIQUE 27: CHANGE THE PACE

---

<!-- Page 442 -->

One of the keys to Sadie's success is her decision-making about switching activities. Students keep thinking about the same idea, but they engage it in different ways. I call this idea **Change the Pace**. It helps to achieve the proper balance of “fast” and “slow,” flow and focus, momentum and attention.

## Changing Activity Types

At the risk of oversimplifying a complex topic, Let me suggest six types of activities we can ask students to participate in. Each requires students to think and engage in a different way. They are:

1. Assimilating knowledge directly from sources, such as direct teacher instruction or reading a text
2. Participating in guided practice
3. Executing skills without teacher support, as in independent practice
4. Discussing ideas with classmates
5. Reflecting independently on an idea—thinking quietly and deeply, often in writing
6. Reviewing previously mastered material to encode it in long-term memory (i.e. *Retrieval Practice*)

All six activity types are important, and students should engage in all of them frequently so they get a well-rounded mental workout.

A couple of caveats in thinking about these activity types:

All six types of activity are important for students to engage in regularly, but choosing among them requires consideration of more than just what feels right in a given moment. How and when you use one type of activity affects how well others will work. Knowledge assimilation, for

---

<!-- Page 443 -->

example is probably the most important activity type, if not in its own right then because of its importance in making the others function well. The cognitive science on this is clear: the other activities, which we often think of, sometimes accurately, sometimes not, as more analytical and “higher order,” are more productive when students have strong background knowledge to support them. Pause now, for example, and reflect for two and a half minutes on the decisions of Napoleon and Lee to attack at Waterloo and Gettysburg respectively. Were they wise? Did the decisions reflect the dominance of personality over tactics?

That’s a higher-order thinking activity if you know a lot about the requisite topics, but if you don’t know enough about military history, there’s not much higher order in your thinking. In fact, there’s not much thinking. Let me quote Daniel Willingham again here: “Thinking well requires knowing facts, and that’s true not simply because you need something to think about. The very processes that teachers care about most—critical thinking processes such as reasoning and problem-solving—are intimately intertwined with factual knowledge that is in long-term memory (not just found in the environment).”

And here’s the National Research Council on the topic: “Over a century of research on transfer has yielded little evidence that teaching can develop general cognitive competencies that are transferable to any new discipline, problem or context.”⁴ Cognition is not a transferable skill and is always context specific and knowledge dependent. Guided practice, discussion, and reflection are all ways to help students think deeply and in higher-order ways, but only if they are preceded by a strong investment in knowledge, directly taught.

In his research Barak Rosenshine provides an excellent description of this. “In a study of mathematics instruction,

---

<!-- Page 444 -->

... less effective teachers gave much shorter presentations and explanations and then ... told students to solve problems. The less successful teachers were then observed going from student to student and having to explain the material again.”^5

Second, as I will discuss in a moment, switching among activity types is often necessary to effective instruction. Your lesson would probably be less successful if you chose one activity type for the *whole lesson* and more successful if you used two or three and asked yourself, for example: when is discussion ideal and for how long and what different activity after it will create the greatest synergy? You can sense that in Sadie's class—her lesson seamlessly incorporates Direct Instruction (via students' note-taking), discussion with *Turn and Talk* partners, and guided practice.

There's no formula, of course. You won't use the same approach every time. Each lesson will require something different; each teacher's style and approach will shape the progression. The goal is to create a feeling of flow, but in fact there are *feelings* of flow—some faster, some slower, some louder, some quieter.

With that in mind, here's a bit more about those six activity types.

**Activity 1: Direct Instruction/Knowledge Assimilation**

When students are presented with new information while they listen, read, or take notes, they are engaged in Direct Instruction/Knowledge Assimilation (KA). This could involve a class reading a text (silently or aloud, by teacher or students) or a teacher lecturing, modeling a problem, or sharing a presentation (with or without occasional questioning of students).

---

<!-- Page 445 -->

The idea of Direct Instruction might at first feel antithetical to pacing, but that is only if you imagine it in caricature—like the teacher in *Ferris Bueller's Day Off* droning on to a room of half-asleep students. When Direct Instruction is implemented well, it not only has important effects on student understanding, but can be energetic and contribute positively to pacing. And the key to implementing it well? As Barak Rosenshine points out, Direct Instruction, like all methods, must respond to the limitations on working memory. “Presenting too much material at once may confuse students because their working memory may be unable to process it… . More effective teachers do not overwhelm their students by presenting too much material at once. Rather these teachers present only small amounts of new material at any time, and then assist the students as they practice this material.”⁶

This may sound at first like it contradicts Rosenshine's observation about the importance of investing heavily in background knowledge first, before engaging students in more interactive forms of processing, but that's not the case. You could imagine how Sadie McCleary might accomplish both. She might spend a few minutes explaining a new concept with students taking notes. Then they might pause: “Discuss how this might apply to X with your partner. Go.” Then perhaps a bit of *Cold Call* to make sure students understood. Then she might spend a few minutes explaining a bit more about the concept. Then a different activity to engage and give working memory time to process. “Take a minute to summarize what we've done so far in writing. Go.” Then she might ask a few students who've written insightful things to share. They might then discuss briefly. Then to the board again. Slides on. Taking notes as she explains a bit more about the concept. Switching from explicit teaching or other forms of knowledge assimilation to short reflective activities and

---

<!-- Page 446 -->

back is the key to both engaging the strengths of working memory and overcoming its limitations. Doing that requires strong pacing skills in terms of activity design and in terms of your ability to make shifts efficient and energizing and your instructional choices strike the balance between novelty and focus.

The first portion of Christine Torres's lesson where she is introducing new vocabulary words is a perfect example of this, especially because teaching new vocabulary words is, for many teachers, such a notoriously low-energy activity: “Here are our new words, please copy down the definitions.” Many teachers respond to this challenge by making the activity independent: “Go look up these words.” This can result in poorer understanding of the words and can take more time. But look at Christine's approach (you can watch this segment of her lesson a little over two minutes into the video in Christine Torres: Keystone). Her steps are:

- Identify the word and ask students to repeat it.
- Provide a definition.
- Ask students to read a situation involving the word (in this case “caustic.”) (What might a judge in American Idol have said if they made a caustic remark?)
- Ask students to Turn and Talk about the example.
- Briefly Cold Call to hear a few answers.
- Show a picture: “How does this image demonstrate the word ‘caustic’?” Turn and Talk again.
- Cold Call to hear answers.

The knowledge is disseminated via Direct Instruction and is followed by a different activity type (usually discussion in pairs) but the cycles are very short so the energy is

---

<!-- Page 447 -->

impressively high and Christine's students learn new knowledge in a joyful flow-like setting.

## Activity 2: Guided Practice/Guided Questioning

When students engage in activities that involve more extensive back-and-forth with the teacher, practicing the use or application of knowledge, they are engaged in guided practice/guided questioning. Rosenshine emphasizes the importance of this stage for working examples and releasing autonomy gradually to students. Guided practice might involve executing the steps in solving a problem, with the teacher asking questions to remind students what step to take next, or it might involve explication of a text passage with the teacher consistently providing new and more targeted questions to unlock understanding. It is usually used before students have independent mastery. Some examples:

After asking her students what would happen to the pressure in a fixed container if temperature increased, Sadie asks, “OK, why would the pressure increase?”

A student says: “Because there are more collisions.”

“But why are there more collisions?” Sadie asks.

“Because the particles are moving faster.”

“OK, what if the container was flexible? Then what?”

A class solves a problem involving systems of equations together, with the teacher asking various students to explain the steps, identify the next step or solve the calculations required in a given step.

During a close reading burst, a teacher asks his students to annotate each reference to the sun in the opening pages of *Grapes of Wrath*. Through a series of questions (some written, some oral), the class unpacks the way Steinbeck

---

<!-- Page 448 -->

reveals the devastating impact of the sun on the land and its people.

To maximize the benefits of novelty bias with guided practice, a teacher would typically unbundle questions, that is, break questions down into smaller pieces so that she could ask them more quickly of a greater number of students, thus maximizing the perception of mileposts. *Cold Calling* participants for each step might also create more of a sense of momentum and flow. On the other hand, a risk of moving more rapidly is that some students could struggle to keep up with or process what they'd seen, so capping a bit of guided practice off with a slower opportunity for note-taking or reflection might be beneficial, as in, “OK, take 90 seconds to make sure you’ve got each step down in your notes and then make a note to yourself about your takeaways for solving this kind of problem.” Independent practice—“OK, now try one on your own; you have three minutes and then we’ll check in”—is also a good way to let students absorb what they’ve learned during guided practice.

## Activity 3: Independent Practice

When students complete work that they know how to do on their own, they are engaged in independent practice (IP). IP is usually done without significant support from the teacher; it’s often done silently. But just because work is silent and independent does not make it IP. For example, silent reading is often knowledge assimilation, and reflecting on or brainstorming solutions to questions students don’t know how to solve is reflection and idea generation, the next topic in this section. By way of distinguishing, IP implies autonomous execution of a skill or application of a knowledge base that students are in the final stages of mastering. Some examples:

---

<!-- Page 449 -->

- Students apply what they've learned about “showing, not telling” by writing three sentences about the experience of a character named Jonas as he rides a roller coaster (without ever saying he rode a roller coaster).
- Students independently solve a set of problems involving systems of equations.
- Students write a summary of the important ways daily life in eighteenth-century America was different from today.

Independent practice is often assigned in large chunks and at the end of the lesson in the “you have till the end of class to get started on this” variety. That’s not wrong, but it can also be allocated in smaller pieces, mid-lesson. Imagine Christine Torres adding a bit of it at the end of her vocabulary lesson: “Take three minutes to write a series of sentences, each one using one of these three new vocabulary words correctly.” Or Sadie McCleary in the middle of notes: “Tonight you’ll have a set of problems to do for homework, but see if you can set this problem up on your own now. You don’t have to solve it, just set it up correctly. One minute. Go.”

Shifting into IP is also a great way to slow things down while you are maintaining flow. That is, the tension between attention and novelty is captured in the idea of shifting (change) into independent practice (highly focused).

**Activity 4: Reflection and Idea Generation**

Reflection often looks like IP, but it serves a different purpose. In IP, students execute work they know how to do on their own. In reflection, students are given time to think in a more open-ended fashion about things they are in the

---

<!-- Page 450 -->

midst of learning or do not yet understand. Reflection is often silent, and frequently involves writing. When the task involves brainstorming potential solutions, it is idea generation. Some examples:

- A teacher asks students to reflect in writing on how differences in daily life in the eighteenth century might have caused people to understand the role of family differently from how we do today.
- A teacher asks students to reflect on an author's stylistic choices and why she might have used a repeated image.
- A teacher asks students to make notes to themselves on the keys to solving a difficult type of problem after solving a few as a group.

Reflection activities are independent, so they function much like IP, but they tend to feel a bit slower as they are open-ended and more formative. Thus they can bring a sense of slowness back to a lesson even in small pieces. They are also important to include because students who, outside of school, are constantly stimulated by their smartphones, increasingly spend less and less time reflecting and letting their minds wander. There may be some value in causing that to happen in school.

## Activity 5: Discussion

Activities in which students develop ideas and answers by talking directly to one another, in small groups or as a class are called Discussion. This might involve a *Turn and Talk* (as we saw in Sadie's class) or using *Habits of Discussion* (see [technique 44](#)), which are to make a larger discussion productive and efficient. In some cases, you might insert batches of discussion during guided practice or questioning to ensure that students *Batch Process* ([technique 45](#))—that

---

<!-- Page 451 -->

is, make a certain number of comments without mediation from you. We call this “playing volleyball, not tennis.” Some examples:

- A teacher asks students to share their opinions about the ethics of genetically modifying food and organisms. She takes three or four student comments in a row and then returns to her presentation on the topic.
- A teacher asks students to participate in a ten-minute whole-class discussion of the impact of corruption on American politics in the 1890s.
- A teacher asks students to *Turn and Talk* (technique 43) with a partner to identify where a peer made a mistake in adding two fractions with unlike denominators.

While whole-class discussions are great, they tend to have a higher transaction cost—it takes time to set them up and to give multiple people a chance to talk. Balancing larger discussions with pair discussions can allow you to include it more frequently and in shorter intervals, especially because a *Turn and Talk* can so easily be made into a routine that students begin quickly and easily, thus preserving ideas in working memory. You can see both Sadie and Christine doing this throughout their lessons.

## Activity 6: Review/Retrieval Practice

Retrieval Practice is reviewing previously mastered content to ensure its encoding in long-term memory and to facilitate its easy retrieval. Including review is not only beneficial from a learning perspective. John Sweller reminds teachers that “the major function of instruction is to allow learners to accumulate critical information in long-term memory.” Sadie is doing this at the beginning of her

---

<!-- Page 452 -->

lesson, as students solve problems they learned how to do earlier in the week.

Because it is so important to learning and so easily overlooked—and sometimes dismissed by educators who haven't read the research—*Retrieval Practice* is its own technique. But since the discussion here is about shifting among and between activities to create a dynamic flow in your lesson, it's worth noting here how helpful inserting short batches of retrieval practice in the midst of other activities can be from a pacing perspective. It's often fast and energetic; it can be done in short doses; it often makes students feel successful.

Let's take a closer look at how the different activity types can come together in a lesson—in this case, one taught by Jessica Bracey, of North Star Academy Vailsburg Middle School (see the video *Jessica Bracey: Keystone*). Consider the activities Jessica shifts between: As class begins, Jessica asks her students to summarize what happened in the previous chapter of the novel they are reading. As her students comment, she steps in to ask for clarification or steer the next question to a given student: “Yes, Angel's bracelet was stolen. What else is going on?” This is guided questioning. Jessica's students spend about two minutes engaging in it and she “unbundles” her questions, spreading the work of summarizing across multiple students. Then she shifts into FASE Reading, continuing the story from the prior day, before asking students to pause and respond to a question in their reading response journals. After students write independently, she leads a whole-class discussion in which students respond to one another's thinking.

We often try to keep class interesting by doing “new” things with students, but what makes Jessica's class interesting is doing *familiar* activities. By shifting between

---

<!-- Page 453 -->

activities that students know how to do well, Jessica creates a feeling of flow. Students are constantly engaged but often in new ways. They shift from reading to writing in their reading response journals in a matter of seconds, because they've done it so many times. Stopping to explain a new activity they hadn't done before—for example, “We're going to do a new kind of writing today; let me explain how it works ...”—would result in a lot of downtime while she explained all the details and while her students internalized the process, using valuable working memory capacity to follow a new set of directions. Even though it might seem as though a new activity would be more interesting, it would be as likely to have the opposite effect. (You can read more about the power of academic systems and routines in [Chapter Ten]().)

After a minute or two of discussion, Jessica's students go back to reading. In fact, Jessica repeats the same cycle again: students read, write in their reflection journals, and discuss throughout the class, with the cycles getting longer and the questions getting harder over time.

At a recent workshop, teachers shared that the shorter recurring cycle of read-write-discuss was different from what they tended to do in their classes. They did the same three activities, but in long, “nonrecurring” chunks. For example, in a typical class, they might read for fifteen to twenty minutes, write for five to ten minutes, and discuss for another ten to fifteen minutes, before tackling an *Exit Ticket* and wrapping up. As Jessica demonstrates, you can bring energy and engagement to your class merely by breaking those chunks into shorter cycles of the same activities.

# TECHNIQUE 28: BRIGHTEN THE LINES

---

<!-- Page 454 -->

Nicole Warren's pacing in the video *Nicole Warren: Keystone* is masterful. Class starts with incredible energy that draws students in and makes them active and engaged: a song; a *Turn and Talk*; a discussion of student reflections from the *Turn and Talk*; and a longer stretch of focused independent work, with students locked-in and focused partly because of the energy of the preceding activities. Part of what makes Nicole's lesson work is her careful design of the flow from activity to activity, in other words, but also watch her release her students into the *Turn and Talk* just under a minute into the video or the independent practice just shy of four minutes in. There's a clear and engaging task. Then a tiny delay for suspense. Then, suddenly, a crisp and quick signal to start, with students leaping into action. Part of what makes the pacing so powerful is the quality of the transitions that begin each activity.

When you take steps to make the beginnings and endings of activities visible and crisp, you *Brighten the Lines*. By calling attention to changes in activities, you ensure that your students can perceive mileposts clearly, and make it easier for them to notice and be attracted to new activity. You're essentially harnessing their novelty bias in a productive way.

## Step 1: The Go Start

The first way to *Brighten Lines* is with a *go start*—shifting from one activity to another on a cue. Starting everyone at the same time with a statement such as, “Okay, scholars. You have three minutes to write a response to this question. Ready? Go!” has several advantages.

First, making the beginning of an activity “pop” makes the activity itself feel a bit like a special event. By using the phrase “go,” you build excitement and anticipation—much

---

<!-- Page 455 -->

like a foottrace—causing students to start together, as a team. Not only does this implicitly frame the forthcoming activity positively, but it also causes everyone in the class to start exactly on cue. That half-second delay causes students to work more industriously once they are “allowed” to. Plus, students see all of their peers snap to it—normalizing the idea of making productive use of time.

The cue doesn't have to be “go,” of course. There are dozens of options you could use (e.g. “off you go”; “give it a go”; “begin,” etc.), but as Peps Mccrea explains in *Motivated Teaching*, the cue is an essential part of the routine. He describes the ideal cue as “distinct,” meaning it won't be misinterpreted, “multimodal,” combining language or speech with action or position, and “punchy.” With cues that fit these criteria, Mccrea argues, we make the norms more visible and thus more widespread across the class. If it's unclear whether everyone else has actually started something, there's a potential incentive to take your time so as to avoid being the outlier (the first to start). If everyone begins on cue, there are no grounds for strategically managing the optimum starting point. Everyone else just started. Better catch up!

Previously, I mentioned that you can use pacing tools to make “slower” work more reflective and engaging; some simple adaptations to the go start can help. You might, for example, encourage deeper, more reflective thinking by prompting students with a slower, quieter cadence, “Ah, a fascinating question: Just who is the hero of this book? You have three minutes to reflect in writing. [Pause] Who is the hero, and how do you know?” Now perhaps you've dropped your voice to a whisper and you say in a slower cadence: “Begin. . . .” This approach still socializes efficient use of time by getting students started right away and as a group, but your slower and quieter delivery of the start cue can communicate something about the tone of reflection you

---

<!-- Page 456 -->

expect. Even using the cue “Begin” as compared to the cue “Go!” suggests less a race and more of a journey. This way, you get the benefits of everyone starting on cue and making good use of time, but also clear and efficient communication of the idea, “I want you to think deeply here; I am looking for thoughtfulness as much as productivity.”

In Christine Torres's class, we see her cue a go start in several different ways. During the vocabulary rollout section of her lesson, her cues to Turn and Talk are high energy and crisp—“Fifteen seconds with your teammate, go!” Students jump into conversation without a moment to lose. Her goal in this section of the lesson is high engagement and participation ratio; she wants to boost the energy of the room and make this section of the lesson feel fast. For a slightly more challenging question, she gives a little more time and slows the pace of her delivery “How does this image demonstrate the word ‘caustic’? Look carefully at the image. Thirty seconds with your teammate to discuss. How does the image demonstrate the word ‘caustic’? Ready, go.” Later in the lesson, as she guides students through a rigorous discussion of Annemarie's bravery, her cues are even slower and reflect the thoughtful focus she hopes students bring to a writing task: “With a teammate … answer questions 2A and 2B. Three minutes, if you're not done, that's OK … Three minutes, go.” In all three instances, students have a clear cue to begin working (as well as a precise time limit, which we'll talk more about in a moment), but the subtle variations in her tone and the speed with which she gives the directions reflect the type of energy she hopes students will bring to the task.

students into independent work. First: Hasan Clayton.  
“Four minutes, silent solo. Let's see what you remember. Eyes in,” he says. His calm, steady tone and presence indicate that this is a moment for thoughtful reflection. Even the pace with which he begins to move around the classroom signals that this activity is meant to be completed with sustained, quiet focus. In contrast, Tamesha McGuire's warm, crisp directions to her kindergarten class—“Ready ... set ... go to work!” (complete with a bright smile)—infuse the independent work with energy and excitement. As students begin working, her cheerful narration maintains the energy of the launch. Jamila Hammett's cue to her small group of third graders is more muted—a student reads the question and she says simply, “Go ahead, take one minute.” She remains silent as students' pencils begin to move to give students space to begin grappling with the challenging *Art of the Sentence* prompt. In each example, the teacher influences the pace and energy of the room through the tone and language of their in-cues; at the same time, all three cues are clear and specific enough to **Brighten the Lines** between activities and ensure that all students are prepared to begin at the same time.

## Clean Finish

Being able to end an activity reliably on cue is also a critical skill for several reasons—the most obvious being time management. How many meetings have you been in where the person running it was unable to say, “Okay, we're done with that; now we're moving on to this,” as it became increasingly obvious that the meeting would run over time or that other topics would be truncated? Time use in the classroom can be done a similar disservice when a teacher can't reliably end one activity to begin the next.

---

<!-- Page 458 -->

There's more value in making activities end crisply and clearly—a skill I call the *clean finish*—than just time management. Ending on cue establishes a clear and discernible transition point from one activity to the next and can actually help students maintain the continuity of their thinking across tasks. Students are better able to carry what is in their working memory from one activity to the next if the transition is efficient and our language is clear. Consider the example in the previous paragraph. You've said to your students, “You have three minutes to reflect in writing: Who is the hero, and how do you know?” If you're going to transition from writing to whole-class discussion or a *Turn and Talk*, you want to minimize disruption in the shift between activities so students can remember the insights they just developed. You want the writing to end on cue, in a single moment, so that you can immediately start looking forward to your next step without anyone losing their train of thought. If your transition from writing to discussion is fast—a few seconds at most—then the ideas that students had before the transition are more likely to cross over to the second activity.

As the three allocated minutes of writing come to a close, you might provide a preliminary reminder that you'll be wrapping up soon: something like “I'll need pencils down in twenty seconds. Try to finish that last thought.” When you get to the end of the allocated time, ideally there'd be a signal. The timer would go off and you'd say, “I hear the timer, and that means pencils down and eyes up, please.” The icing on the cake is that crisp, visible transitions also affect pacing. The milepost is bright and clear, and students can see it passing. Better still, when the milepost is clear, you can also connect the pieces of the lesson together through use of segues, language that highlights the most important threads of the lesson that tie multiple activities

---

<!-- Page 459 -->

together. (For more on segues, see [Chapter Five](Chapter Five), Lesson Structures.)

A final note to observe here: The same tools used to speed up pacing, lightly adapted, can slow things down as well. For example, you might say to your class, quietly and with a slow and reflective tempo: “In thirty seconds, your journal writing session will come to an end. At the beep, please close your journals and give me your eyes.” Then you might let the timer beep for a few seconds or leave a silent pause of a few seconds and add, “Good. Now we’re ready to discuss.” It’s still a clean finish with bright lines, but it establishes a slower pace and quieter tone. In fact, you could argue that *Brighten the Lines* is *most* useful for this kind of slower, more thoughtful task, where stepping in to be more directive is also more disruptive to the quiet, reflective mood of the room. Crisp transitions are often most useful at exactly the time you would least expect them to be, and where their use is least intuitive.

## TECHNIQUE 29: ALL HANDS

Raising your hand is an act that deserves some reflection, even if at first it seems straightforward.

For example, every time students raise their hands they mark the passage of an event worthy of action. They say, both to themselves and others, “There was a question there, and I want to answer it.” The question is distinguished from the previous one. It has novelty. Now it is a milepost. The intent to answer also distinguishes the moment. It’s a decision that the lesson is worth it: the rewards of speaking outweigh the risks. There is a shift in student’s self-perception: I wasn’t just sitting here passively; I was having ideas. I want to share them. The act of hand-raising can draw students further into a lesson and change them from the outside in.

---

<!-- Page 460 -->

Hand-raising is also contagious. When students see their peers eagerly volunteering, a norm is established that the classroom is a safe, engaging place that others want to be a part of, and the incentive to participate spreads around the room. “The norms we hold arise predominantly from our observation of others,” says Peps Mccrea. And making a decision to engage with the content publicly affirms that a student thinks being a part of the group and its activity is worthwhile. It is a referendum on the worthiness of the class or the lesson.

For teachers, the sight of a host of volunteers means not having to try to drag participants into the conversation. Few things make time move more slowly, even in a staff meeting, than a question hanging in the air as we all avoid each other's eyes. The seconds lengthen as everyone shifts uncomfortably in their seats.

Much of what we think about a classroom when we observe it is in fact a reading of the semiotics of hand-raising: Are students eager to speak? Are hands sparse and reluctant? Do students speak without raising their hands at all?

*All Hands* helps you manage aspects of student hand-raising to maximize the benefits of its influence on pacing and engagement and shape students' perception of what's happening in the classroom.

**Hands Down**

It may sound counterintuitive (particularly in a technique called *All Hands*), but the act of putting your hand down is also important: It says that one question has been answered and a new one is coming. It inserts a milestone and causes students to perceive separate events. An undifferentiated stretch of time in which the class was “talking about the government” becomes a question about the Executive Branch followed by a question about the

---

<!-- Page 461 -->

Judicial Branch followed by one about the Legislative Branch. Mileposts are speeding past. Pacing is sped up.

Alternatively, we've all had the student whose hand remains permanently raised throughout a series of questions and answers, waving in the air for minutes at a time. If you call on him you are unlikely to get a response to the most recent comment or the topic currently under discussion. You're likely to get a response to a question that caused your student to raise his hand ten minutes ago. You're more likely to be calling on someone who wants to speak but not necessarily to respond or answer or connect to the ideas of others.

Lowering your hand also communicates respect for your peers because it's difficult to listen and have your hand up at the same time. A classroom where hands are up while someone is speaking is a classroom where people are saying, essentially, “What you're saying won't change what I want to say.” It's very hard to listen carefully to someone else’s idea when your raised hand is a cue to try to keep your own previous idea in your working memory. Putting hands down when someone else is speaking communicates respect and interest in someone else's idea. In order to ensure that students' enthusiasm to participate isn't dampened every time they lower their hands, it's helpful to share the rationale for students and have a clear cue for when hands should be raised or lowered, even something as simple as “hands down” or a nonverbal gesture to remind students to be fully attentive to the comments of their class teammate. (For more on the effect that this peer-to-peer listening can have on the speaker, check out technique 44, Habits of Discussion.)

You can see an example of how this works in Christine Torres's vocabulary lesson. “The word ‘implore’ means what?” Christine asks, and almost every hand is in the air

---

<!-- Page 462 -->

as she pauses briefly before identifying Jovon as the student who will answer. As she does this every hand goes down, as if to say *Jovon, we are listening. It's your turn.* Seconds later Christine says, “Read the situation for me loud and proud …” and again almost every hand goes up before she calls on Juju, whereupon, again, everyone's hand goes down. This reminds students: now is the time to listen to what Juju says, not to be thinking of what you would have said. Seconds later Christine asks, “What did the girl do in this situation? Use the definition.” Again every hand goes up. Now it's Etani's turn and the process of putting hands down—again, this happens on cue because Christine has taught it—reminds students of the rest of the routine implicit in someone else getting called on. Putting one's hand down to listen cues the next step in listening behavior: giving Etani eye contact. James Clear describes this as “habit stacking,” where one habit leads to another and a series of positive actions can reliably result if they are connected consistently to a relatively simple first action.

Beyond the effect of each individual interaction, in Christine's use of *All Hands* you can clearly see the mileposts flying past. The illusion of speed has been created. A traditionally slow activity—vocabulary—has been brought to life.

## Press Pause on Digressions

Sometimes we lightheartedly refer to managing a group of people as herding cats. In any group of people, some will occasionally just wander off in their own direction, physically or intellectually—even when it's beneficial or appropriate to stick together. When you've got ground to cover as a teacher, you can't always let everyone just head off on a tangent. A good cowboy has to know how to bring

---

<!-- Page 463 -->

the wanderers back into the fold quickly and smoothly. A good teacher, too. It's part of the job.

Similarly, even when they are eager to share, students' comments can inadvertently derail the pacing or focus of a lesson by being digressive or just plain off-topic. Don't get me wrong. I love long and insightful student comments—when they come at the right time. However, a long and tangentially related comment that involves references to several obscure and only semi-relevant shows and movies at the wrong time is a rally-killer. (It can be that even with best intentions and offered at the “right time”) There you are, finally having gotten a quality discussion about *The Giver* going with lots of kids weighing in. There are only five minutes left in class but there's so much good thinking going on and just maybe the epiphany about what “release” means is about to happen, when one young wanderer begins a long-winded and meandering discussion of some of his personal highlights of the novel. He's lost his train of thought now, so he's throwing words at the problem—trying to use quantity to make up for a loss of clarity. In that moment it feels a bit like grounding into a double play, except maybe it's multiple double plays (I say this lovingly). Suddenly the optimism that you're going to pull it out and get to the epiphany evaporates into thin air.

In this situation you need a way to press pause on the digression, to help him cut his comment off even though he hasn't offered to end it. If you can do so warmly and skillfully, without making your student feel embarrassed, it's good for the class discussion (and therefore for learning) and *good for him*. To let him go on and on is a disservice. “Helpful” is providing a gentle nudge to help young people understand how to read their audience and setting.

---

<!-- Page 464 -->

Ending a digression quickly and politely just takes a little technique. I call it pressing pause because the word “pause” is so helpful, especially when followed by a statement pointing out what's useful about what's already been shared. “Pause there, Daniel. You've given us so much to talk about already. Let's let some other folks respond.” Boom. The rally is back on! The positivity is important. Some other variations might include: “Ooh. Pause there. You mentioned the memories he's started to receive and how emotional they are. Who else thought about that?” or even “Ooh. Pause. Interesting. Yes, the memories are so emotional; who can tell us why that matters?” You also might be able to redirect students to the most productive part of their answer: “Pause. That phrase, ‘more emotion than he's ever felt.’ Let's focus on that for a minute.” This is a way of gently cutting him off before he can get too far afield, while still extracting value from his answer and, you hope, helping him see what was valuable in it for next time.

If you are able to convey your appreciation for a student's participation while maintaining focus on the question at hand, you'll be more likely to step in and press pause when it's necessary for the sake of the learning community. Although some unexpected student comments are worth their weight in gold, some are not, and it's the job of the teacher to maintain the lesson's pacing through how time is allocated in the classroom.

A final note: I am a big fan of the word “pause,” specifically, in this application, as opposed to the words “stop” or “freeze” or something else. Pause implies that the stop is temporary and has a gentleness. “Stop” tends to make it feel like you've done something wrong—“pause” implies you will start up again at some point, that you will continue to share your thinking. Which, happily, is true.

# Online Lessons: Online *Needs Flow*

Pacing draws on the principle of flow, the idea that people take pleasure in being swept up in an engaging and dynamic activity. This is a critical driver of excellence in the classroom. Online, it's necessary to stave off disaster. Students who are bored or feel no connection to the lesson can't walk out of a classroom. If they disengage you can see it—in the empty page before them or the lack of follow-through on task. Sometimes they'll make you see their disengagement via behavior. Not online. There, unengaged students will simply slip away. They'll turn off their camera if you'll let them and then goodness only knows what they're doing. Or they'll toggle off to another screen or engage themselves on their phone or some other device. They'll be playing Minecraft or be on TikTok and you'll never know they're gone.

So teaching in an online setting puts a premium on pacing—the momentum of a lesson has to draw students in right from the outset and sustain their focus. In the video *Arrianna Chopp: Means of Participation*, you can see Arrianna Chopp of Libertas Prep in Los Angeles bring pacing to her online lesson from the word go. Within seconds of starting class there's a task that everyone completes (answering in the chat). This is supported by Arrianna “narrating the chat,” that is, letting students know she sees and appreciates when they participate but also building a sense of momentum to make participation visible to other students. It's like a wave of forward momentum that she quickly translates into a mini discussion where three students in a row give their opinion. It's fast and engaging and inclusive of everyone. There's not time to get lost in the far corners

---

<!-- Page 466 -->

of the Internet. Just possibly this sense of dynamism—especially at the start of the lesson—is something we can borrow online.

# TECHNIQUE 30: WORK THE CLOCK

We measure things because they matter. Time is the greatest resource you as a classroom teacher manage, so measuring that time intentionally, strategically, and often visibly is critical in shaping your students' experience in the classroom. This skill is called *Work the Clock*.

## Show the Clock

First, *show the clock*: make time visible to students. Showing how you allocate time—indicating how much you allow for certain activities and that you track its passage during a lesson—will help students understand that you value its wise and careful allocation, and will ultimately teach them to be attentive to it as well.

Showing the clock also has the added benefit of helping you discipline yourself. What teacher hasn't planned five minutes for an activity, for example, but unintentionally spent fifteen on it? What teacher hasn't told her students, “You have ten minutes to work on this,” only to lose track of time and give students twice—or half—that? The result can often be a lesson that ends incompletely; you don't get to the end of the story or the experiment, or you end with only guided practice rather than independent practice.

When you send students off to try a problem for a few minutes, make your best guess as to how long it should take and say, “OK, try one of these on your own. I'll give you three minutes.” Then start your stopwatch or, better, start an overhead stopwatch—perhaps an LCD clock you

---

<!-- Page 467 -->

can project on the overhead or on the wall. If students can see the clock, they can self-manage—learning, for example, to pace their time for a short-answer response.

Some might protest that they don't want to be locked into a specific time allocation for an activity when they don't really know how long it will take, but it's important to remember that you're not actually locked in by giving an initial time allocation. If the time you allocated wasn't enough, you can always extend it (“OK, we've been working hard, and it looks like another two minutes might help”) or shorten it (“Wow, your answers are too interesting and too good to wait the full three minutes, so we'll check in at two minutes!”).

Showing the clock gives rise to a time-sensitive culture. I would love to tell you that classrooms should be timeless places where we take as long as we need and follow every digression, but we all know that's not the reality of our daily periods of forty-two, fifty-five, or seventy-five minutes. And the fact is that you are more likely to be able to occasionally meander timelessly if you manage the rest of your time very well.

*Showing* time also allows you to *talk about time* less often. Projecting a clock as it counts down the minutes or seconds on an activity requires no additional narration once your students have learned to attend to it (and once they know that you're going to abide by it). You just say, “Okay, let's go,” start the clock, and let it run, perhaps offering an occasional reminder (“You'll hear the beep in just under a minute,” for example). Then say, “Okay, let's see how we did,” when the timer has finally wound down.

Several years of applying the tools of master teachers has led my Uncommon Schools Teach Like a Champion team to use this at our workshops. During independent work (or breaks!) we often project an Internet stopwatch so that

---

<!-- Page 468 -->

participants know where they stand on time. Generally we find that they much prefer self-management to being constantly managed by us—particularly at lunch breaks.

You can encourage students to embrace time management and develop time management skills by setting up opportunities for them to complete multiple tasks during a block of independent time. “I’m putting twenty minutes on the clock. In that time, you need to edit your paragraph and complete your self-assessment.”

## Use Specific, Odd Increments

Whether you are showing the clock or are the only one who can see it, it’s valuable to *use specific times and odd increments* when you discuss time allocations with your class. Consider this mundane case study. If I was leading a professional development session for teachers and said, “Okay, let’s take a short break and pick up again in ten minutes,” I would probably not have people return ready to work in ten minutes. The time allocation I used—ten minutes—sounds like an estimate. Round numbers often contain an implicit “about” in them, as in “Let’s pick up again in about ten minutes.” Ironically, I’d get people back and ready to work much more quickly if I gave them a longer time increment for their break, *as long as it was specific*. In a race between “Okay, let’s take a short break and pick up again in ten minutes” and “Okay, let’s take a short break and pick up again in twelve minutes,” I am betting on the second group every time.

In your classroom, be specific about exactly how long students have for an activity, and vary your allocations. Four minutes of group work is usually better than five minutes of group work (and three minutes is better than “two minutes,” which also sounds like an estimate), but better than both is an initial round of solo writing for two

---

<!-- Page 469 -->

and a half minutes and then a group discussion for three minutes. The variation in allocations for different activities or different iterations of the same activity communicates your intentionality about time. You care about and are precise about time, and this makes others respect it as well. Having established such a track record, you're actually likely to get a pretty good response from folks if you do occasionally use “two minutes” and the like.

In the video *Emily Badillo: Go Right to Work*, which shows a recent fourth-grade lesson on *Number the Stars*, Emily Badillo launches a writing task with four minutes (not five!) of work time. After explaining that she'll be looking for example sentences to share with the class, Emily cues the group to begin by restating the time: “You've got four minutes. Go right to work.” She immediately sets a four-minute timer on the red stopwatch attached to the front board so that all students can keep an eye on their time as they're working. As she circulates, Emily keeps one eye on the clock so she can provide verbal time stamps for students as they go. “You've been working for one minute,” she says. “Looks like almost everyone is done with the first sentence. Keep up that speed.” This narration helps students check their own pace and mark the passage of time—How much have I accomplished in this first minute? Am I on track with the rest of the class?—but is warmly and positively delivered, emphasizing success and encouraging those who might not be finished yet. After another two minutes of work time, Emily addresses the room again —“You have one minute and thirty-six seconds left. Get as far as you can.” The precision here helps students see that she'll be taking the end of work time seriously (it's not an approximation or an estimate) but her encouragement to “get as far as you can” lessens the pressure, reassuring students that while the group will be stopping soon, each person's job is simply to make as much progress as possible

---

<!-- Page 470 -->

in the time allotted. Finally, she tells students, “You have twenty-five seconds left, wrap up the sentence that you are on,” preparing students for the end cue and ensuring they aren’t caught off guard by the timer. When the timer goes off, Emily says simply, “Stop where you are, put your pencils down,” pauses the timer, and begins to *Cold Call* students to share their work.

We see teachers using *Work the Clock* phrases at a few key moments of an activity—at the outset or in the launch in order to set expectations, periodically throughout work time to set benchmarks for progress or encourage stamina, at in the final thirty seconds or so, to cue students to wrap up their thinking and prepare for the transition. Here are a few phrases that might come in handy:

“You have the next two minutes to respond to Question 2. If you finish early, try Question 3 as a challenge.”

“You've been working for two minutes and thirty seconds. Looks like most of us are working on the third problem.”

“We have about three minutes left; you should be moving on from your reading into answering the first reflection question.”

“Wrap up your conversation with your partner in the next ten seconds.”

“You'll hear the timer in another forty seconds; finish the sentence you're working on.”

## Using Countdowns Effectively

A countdown is a statement of a desire to get something done within an explicit time frame—one that's shorter than it might otherwise be. On the basis of observations, I encourage the judicious use of countdowns in most

---

<!-- Page 471 -->

classrooms, especially when they follow some important dos and don'ts:

**Dos**

Do use countdowns for simple tasks, wrap-ups, or transitions. Be aware that you will disrupt a certain percentage of work in the room. For this reason, try to transition, over time, to less narrated countdowns, advising students to be “ready for the [timer] beeps in ten seconds” or merely counting selected digits (for example, “Ten, nine [pause for a few seconds], five, four [pause], two, and one.”)

Do use the lowest countdown possible. Be cautious about giving students too much time to do a simple task. Putting pencils down shouldn't take ten seconds, so don't use a countdown from ten. Try three. The idea behind a countdown is to give students just enough time to do something well. Don't rush students by setting an unreasonable goal, but do be constantly encouraging students to manage their time efficiently during transitions and other mundane tasks and to be attentive to efficiency in academic tasks.

Do narrate follow-through *during* a countdown. If I narrate during countdown, for example, “I'll need your eyes up here in five, four, Nick is ready to go, two, Sarah's ready,” I am describing students who exceeded expectations. In other words, call students' attention to exemplars *during a time when they can all still meet your expectations for them*.

**Don'ts**

Don't stretch a countdown—that is, don't slow it down to match student behavior. If you do, it shows that you will adjust the countdown to the alacrity (or lack of it) students

---

<!-- Page 472 -->

demonstrate, rather than the reverse. This defeats the whole purpose. It's much better to end on time and respond with feedback: “Looks like we didn't quite make it. Next time, we have to be faster so we can get back to the novel.”

Don't narrate follow-through after a countdown has finished. In doing so, you are describing a student who has merely done what you asked, and you risk making it sound as though you are pleading for follow-through (“Won't you please try to be like the kids who've done what I asked?”). This can undercut expectations as effectively as it can reinforce them.

Don't overnarrate students who have met your expectations. A few quick acknowledgments of those who are ready is great. Too many, and it sounds as though you're worried students won't follow through on what you've asked them to do.

## TECHNIQUE 31: EVERY MINUTE MATTERS

Respect students' time by spending every minute intentionally.

I observed one of my favorite moments in teaching—simple, humble, and powerful—early in my *Teach Like a Champion* study process when I saw Annette Riffle of North Star Academy in Newark working with her fifth-grade math students. The moment started with an utterly typical scene. Students had solved a problem on the coordinate plane independently at their desks. They'd had to plot certain points to show the outlines of a hypothetical stadium. Annette ended the independent work with a crisp, pace-accentuating clean finish—a series of claps that she gives and that students echo to bring them to attention. Then she said, “Someone come give us a stadium,” handing the

---

<!-- Page 473 -->

marker to a girl named Kadheisha, who excitedly approached the front of the room to model her work on the overhead.

Ten thousand teachers have, from time immemorial, called a million students up to the board to “show their work,” and not much usually happens while one student puts said work up on the board. Twenty-nine students sit and wait for thirty seconds or a minute while the student in question completes the work they will soon review. Perhaps in some classes, three or four students put problems up on the board at once. But the rest of the group does precious little, even if told to “pay attention to what they're writing.” Twenty-nine students wasting thirty seconds are the same as one student wasting almost fifteen minutes, except that, in addition, precious amounts of momentum are also squandered reenergizing students who've lost the task.

What came next in Annette's class, though, was quietly brilliant.

While Kadheisha did her work at the board, Annette did a quick review of key terms and ideas with the rest of her students. “What quadrant are we in? Fatimah? And what do we call that line along the bottom? Sean? And which direction does the x-axis run, Shatavia?” The result was not only a productive use of time and the reinforcement of key facts during what would otherwise be downtime, but also an exercise that increased the likelihood that students would use key vocabulary words to analyze and describe Kadheisha's work.

Time, I was reminded in watching Annette's class, is water in the desert. It is a teacher's most precious resource—it is to be husbanded, guarded, and conserved. Every minute of it matters and the way we use it shows students where our priorities lie. We must work to maximize the precious moments of class we share with students to ensure we're

---

<!-- Page 474 -->

using our time as intentionally as possible. This is not to say we must avoid all downtime or breaks—after all, these can be opportunities to have meaningful interactions with students—but rather to emphasize that we must be deliberate and thoughtful in our choice about how to spend even the smallest increment of time. Mastering *Every Minute Matters* means deciding how to spend time intentionally, even in the moments between activities or other everyday pockets of time that are easy to miss.

---

<!-- Page 475 -->

**Every Minute Matters ... Even in the Hallway**

One of the very first videos we shot in what became the *Teach Like a Champion* project, long before there was such a name, is a short video of History teacher Jamey Verilli managing his minutes one afternoon at North Star Academy. Waiting for the rest of the class to arrive with some of his students in the hallway just outside his classroom, he begins quizzing students on their vocabulary:

> “What does it mean to be ‘bound’ to do something?”  
> “Can you use it in a sentence, John?”  
> “Who would have been bound to the land in a Middle Ages town?”  
> “What are you bound to be doing right now?”

Class has not even started yet. Not in the classroom, not during class time, but Jamey recognized a learning opportunity. Meanwhile, his students are excited, smiling, happy to be engaged, and showing off their knowledge.

Purposeless time can kill momentum. One reason that Jamey’s students are so invested and engaged is the message he is sending. He’s showing he believes that their time is important, not to be wasted, and that they and what they are learning is of great significance. A teacher like Jamey creates a sense of meaning and productivity that pervades the room.

The first step in *Every Minute Matters* is a psychological one: recalibrating your expectations so that you think not,

---

<!-- Page 476 -->

“Well, it's just thirty seconds” but rather, “Good gosh, thirty seconds—how can we use that well?” There's a quiet confidence implicit in such a shift. The well-it's-just-thirty-seconds teacher tacitly assumes that he could not do much with thirty seconds, so why bother? The second teacher knows, believes in, and embraces how much he might accomplish even in a very short period of time. After all, almost everything we've ever learned, we learned in the end, in a minute. There was an extra minute of reflection, practice, explanation, or discussion that pushed us over the top and perfected our skill or knowledge. There's no reason to believe that the profundity of the learning has to correlate to the glamour, predictability, and formality of the setting. The critical moment can just as easily come at 2:59 p.m. on Friday afternoon as the buses start to fill the circle in front of school as it can in the middle of your lesson on Wednesday morning.

Once you've embraced that notion, you'll start seeing pockets of time everywhere, where once, it seems, none had existed. A bit of occasional advance planning will help you make the most of it. Keeping at the ready—in your “back pocket”—some activities and groups of thematic questions aligned to what you're teaching can make the difference.

## Back-Pocket Questions

If you work in a school, you are alert to the constant potential for the unexpected. Schools are complex organizations where the perfect flow of scheduled events is sometimes disrupted. So it's useful to be ready for the unexpected by having a portfolio of quick and useful back-pocket questions ready to go. These activities are also much easier to incorporate impromptu when students recognize them as something familiar that they know. You might opt to give a name to the activities you do most often

---

<!-- Page 477 -->

so students know what to expect. For example, “Let’s do a little vocab bingo” saves the time you’d need to explain a new procedure or activity. They can live in a real pocket (on a set of note cards) or a metaphorical one. Plan the questions both periodically (every three weeks or so) and in advance, so that they are aligned to key objectives for your current unit. I also know teachers who keep a mental list of good topics for Q&A among mastered skills, enabling them to strategically spiral in practice and ensure retention of mastered content. You can always review key vocabulary, just as you can always ask students to put historical events in chronological order or put events from a novel in sequence.

Without any props at all, you can always ask “math chains”—sequential math problems such as “Three times six. Now doubled. Take that number’s square root. Subtract seventeen and take the absolute value. Add 104. Your answer is?” My colleague Paul Powell did this daily when he started a school—Troy Prep in Troy, New York—in a building whose layout had students regularly waiting for others to clear tiny landings and passageways before they could move between classes. There on the landings and stairs, with Paul calling problems to students a dozen stairs above or a dozen below, his students mastered hours of math—ultimately resulting in some of the highest math scores in New York State.
