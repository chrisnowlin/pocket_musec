### TECHNIQUE 20: DO NOW

The way we start class sends a strong message to students about the culture, purpose, and expectations of the community they are entering, so teachers should be intentional about it. We want students to engage in productive and high-quality work that interests and challenges them right away, and over time we want to make a habit of this, so they expect to be actively and meaningfully engaged any time they enter our classrooms. We want them to know we are prepared and value their learning. They will not be passive; there will be very little downtime.

So consistently starting quickly and with a quality task is important. A predictable familiar activity that students know how to do lets them get started actively and with confidence.

The first step in a great lesson, then, is a *Do Now*—a short pencil-to-paper activity that is waiting for students as they enter the classroom and that they can and should start without any directions from you.

The secret is the “without directions from you” part. A procedure that does not require guidance from you beyond posting the task beforehand benefits you as well as your students, especially when you are teaching a full schedule. It gives you the chance to take a final glance at your lesson preparation document, make sure the classroom is arranged how you want it, connect with an individual student or two, or pass back some papers—perhaps even

somewhere in there you manage a sip of coffee. All this happens, efficiently and smoothly, while students are busily and productively engaged. At the same time, it's a moment for students to mentally transition to your classroom. Regardless of what happened in the hallway or at the close of a prior class or at lunch, beginning with a few quiet, focused minutes can help students be ready to succeed.

An effective Do Now should meet three critical criteria to ensure that it's focused, efficient, and effective:

1. The Do Now should be in the same place every day so it becomes habit for all your students. You can write it on the board, post it on a piece of chart paper in advance, or put it on a sheet of paper you leave in a stack by the door. Wherever you put it, keep it consistent.

2. Students should be able to complete the Do Now without any direction from you, without any discussion with their classmates, and in most cases without any materials beyond what they always bring to class. So if the Do Now is to write a sentence interpreting a primary source document that is a nineteenth-century Punch cartoon, that cartoon should be copied into the Do Now materials or posted somewhere easily visible. Some teachers misunderstand the purpose of the Do Now and start by explaining to their students what to do and how to do it (for example, “OK, class, the Do Now is on the board. You'll notice that it asks you to do X and then Y. Please get started.”). This defeats the purpose of a self-managed routine to start class. If you have to give directions, it's not independent enough.

3. The activity should take about five minutes to complete and should require putting a pencil to paper. That is, there should be a written product from it. This not only makes it more rigorous and more engaging but also

enables you to better gather data through *Active Observation* and reinforce students who've done good work.

In the great majority of cases, the *Do Now* is silent work. I can imagine an occasional exception for peer-to-peer quizzing with a Knowledge Organizer or some other form of retrieval practice, but only occasionally and for a class with a well-established routine.

With regard to the content of the *Do Now*, I favor three options. The activity can (1) preview the day's lesson (you are reading *The Jacket*, and the *Do Now* asks students to write three sentences about what they'd do if they thought someone stole their little brother's favorite jacket); (2) review a recent lesson (you recently introduced three new vocabulary terms and want students to review the definitions so they don't forget them); or (3) build background knowledge that will be necessary for the upcoming lesson (you are reading *Number the Stars* and want students to read a short nonfiction excerpt about rationing during World War II). Though all options can be powerful, I want to take a moment to highlight the particular benefits of using the *Do Now* as an opportunity for regular, low-stakes review.

In *Small Teaching*, James Lang notes that “a brief (and ungraded) multiple-choice quiz at the beginning and end of class and one additional quiz before the exam raised the grades of all students by a full letter grade.” These brief low-stakes “quizzes” (you can choose if you grade them or have students grade against a key) actually lowered students' anxiety on end-of-unit assessments, because they reported feeling more prepared. Of course, as I discuss in *Retrieval Practice* (*technique 7*), this is because, as Lang puts it, “Every time we extract a piece of information or an experience from our memory, we are strengthening neural

---

<!-- Page 357 -->

pathways that lead from our long-term memory into our working memory, where we can use our memories to think and take action.” By using *Do Now* as a way for students to quickly review critical information from prior lessons, you are setting them up not only for increased engagement in the upcoming lesson, but also ensuring that they are able to retrieve that information at relevant moments later on.

Just as important as the content of your *Do Now* is how you review it with students. The most common downfall I observe is a teacher losing track of time while reviewing answers. Fifteen minutes into a *Do Now* the “opening” has replaced the lesson that was originally planned—or at least has crowded out all of the independent practice and pushed all the timings to the breaking point. Set a timer so you complete your review in about the same amount of time you give students to work on it: three to five minutes. This may require the art of selective neglect. If you give your students eight problems to complete, you may not be able to review all of them. You'll have to choose the two or three that are most important. This makes the period when students are working critical from a Check for Understanding perspective—you'll want to observe carefully to make sure you know which questions most require review, as well as which students can provide answers that are correct or contain useful errors. You'll only have a few minutes to decide this so be ready to draw on the ideas in Active Observation ([technique 9]()).

You can see a great example of Sarah Wright debriefing a *Do Now* in the video *Sarah Wright: But Esperanza*. Here's a copy of her *Do Now* from a lesson on Pam Muñoz-Ryan's novel *Esperanza Rising*,

# Do Now

1. Develop this sentence: Miguel warned to prove to Esperanza that “things would get better.”
   - Miguel wanted to prove to Esperanza that “things would get better,” but__________
   - Miguel wanted to prove to Esperanza that “things would get better,” because__________
   - Miguel wanted to prove to Esperanza that “things would get better,” so__________

2. Imagine Tio Luis discovers that Abuelita has disappeared. Write down what he might say to himself as he burns with **unrelenting** anger.  
   **Challenge**: use two of our vocabulary words!

Notice Sarah's *Show Call* of exemplary answers, which socializes students to work their hardest at written work. She also makes explicit reference to her purpose in designing the *Do Now* as she has: She wants students to

---

<!-- Page 359 -->

review key events from the previous day's reading and reflect on important characters' motivations to give context to the final scenes of the book. She uses rich and engaging Because, But, So questions—a method I discuss in *Art of the Sentence* (technique 41) that comes from Judith Hochman and Natalie Wexler's book *The Writing Revolution*—to build the complexity of students' thinking. You can see how engaging students found it in the enthusiasm and rigor of their comments in the discussion. But notice how briskly Sarah moves through the review. Her goal is an attentive and enthusiastic discussion but not a long one. It's so easy to assume that the discussion deserves more time given all the enthusiasm, but by keeping her discussion tidy Sarah transfers energy to the next task.

Since the Do Now is a consistent procedure we want students to follow every day, it's important to reinforce process and expectations. In the video *Christine Torres: Silently to Seats* you can see Christine Torres do this, appreciatively and quietly naming students as they meet expectations in completing this Do Now. Here's what her students are working on, by the way. It's designed to build background knowledge for the passage from the novel *Number the Stars* that students will study in class that day (in which the protagonist journeys through the woods).

Christine reminds us, as Tom Bennett observes in *Running the Room*, that the best time to reinforce expectations is when students are doing things well. “One of the most underused strategies is to reinforce norms when they are happening,” he writes. Especially when they're going well. “Calm, quiet, and settled” is the ideal emotional state for receiving guidance on how to do things.

## Reading Symbolically: The Woods

The forest is a mysterious place; in legends and fairy tales, the woods are usually full of mysterious creatures, symbols of all the dangers which young people must face if they are to become adults. “Hansel and Gretel,” “Snow White,” “Little Red Riding Hood” — in these and many more tales, the forest is a place away from civilization, a place of testing, an unexplored land full of the unknown.

The forest is often the home of the outlaws or a place where typical rules no longer apply. Since its trees obscure the light of the sun, it’s often a place of literal and figurative darkness and mystery. Entering the forest can be seen as a metaphor for entering the unknown. Sometimes it is also a place of opportunity and transformation—the hero enters the forest and discovers something about him- or herself.

---

<!-- Page 361 -->

1. Consider the final line of this text: “Sometimes it is also a place of opportunity and transformation—the hero enters the forest and discovers something about him- or herself.”  
   a. What does the pronoun “it” refer to?__________  
   b. What might Annemarie have discovered about herself during her journey through the forest?  

2. Why might Lowry have chosen to have Annemarie journey through a forest, instead of, say, through a town or a field? Underline any words or phrases in the text above that support your thinking.  

Finally, some of the masters of the *Do Now*, in my opinion, are effective because of the speed with which they transition from completing the *Do Now* to reviewing it. They might count down the end of the *Do Now* with something like, “OK, pencils down when you hear the beep, and we’ll talk about some of these questions.” Or when the timer starts to beep, they might immediately start in with a *Cold Call* (technique 34) or a *Show Call* (technique 13), not wasting a second of time. This creates a strong sense of momentum from the outset. The sensation of “flow,” which, as I discuss in *Chapter Six*, is a state of mind in which people lose themselves in a fast-paced and engaging activity, is among the most pleasurable experiences you can

---

<!-- Page 362 -->

create in the classroom. The pace of a good *Do* Now can get a lesson flowing right from the outset.

# Online Lessons: The Remote *Do Now*

The start of a lesson is especially important online. When students are far from us and the classroom it's often doubly important to remind them of familiar routines and habits—providing comfort and continuity in a topsy-turvy world.

We loved watching Joshua Humphrey do this with his students at KIPP St. Louis High School in the video *Joshua Humphrey: Pause It Right Now*. Joshua starts his online lesson—it's asynchronous, meaning students will watch the recorded lesson later—with a *Do Now* and the phrase “just like we always do,” reminding his students of the familiar moments and habits of their in-class life. Of course he's made some adaptations too: in an asynchronous lesson he can't just leave his *Do Now* passively on the screen and assume students will complete it, so class begins with a short greeting before the *Do Now*, for example. And he has to be direct and clear about pausing the video to complete the task. But Joshua's review of his *Do Now* afterwards is instructive to both remote and in-person instruction. His tone is perfect—his emotional constancy in describing errors makes it safe to struggle. His pacing during the explanation of the answers is crisp but not rushed, and most of all he uses colored highlights to guide students' eyes through the review of right and wrong answers to help them focus on and attend to the most important things. Students learn about what they attend to. The difficulties of online learning caused us to see the value of guiding students' eyes to focus on key details, but this lesson is surely applicable everywhere.

---

<!-- Page 364 -->

Another *Do Now* that we learned from online was Hasan Clayton's at Nashville Classical Charter School. Hasan's lesson in the video *Hasan Clayton: Two Noses* is synchronous—his students are with him live—so he greets them warmly but quickly and then asks them to complete their *Do Now* task “in the chat.” They can send their answers to him and he can instantly review. And of course this way he'll know who's completed the task when. Notice that the substantive part of his *Do Now* in an online setting is reduced to just one question: “In one artful sentence, summarize the nature versus nurture debate. Include a word that shows contrast....” You can read more about Hasan's decision to have his students respond in “one artful sentence” in [technique 41](#), *Art of the Sentence*. Hasan has students chat that their answers just to him so he can choose a few thought-provoking or exemplary answers and share them with the class (a sort of an online *Show Call*) to prompt a rich discussion and honor students who've done quality work. Notice also, though, that Hasan adds a second, more playful question to his *Do Now* (Would you rather have one eye or two noses?). The purpose is in the playfulness. Hasan is using the question to build community and connection among students when they are isolated and separated by circumstance. He's careful to spend only a little time on this but he and his colleagues did it regularly when teaching online to build positive culture, and you can imagine how the occasional playful *Do Now* question could be a bonus, even in a brick-and-mortar classroom.

## TECHNIQUE 21: TAKE THE STEPS^1

Strong content knowledge is essential to excellence in teaching but it also has a downside. Expertise carries with

---

<!-- Page 365 -->

it what some cognitive scientists call it the “curse of knowledge:”^2 It’s hard for experts to understand why things are hard for novices. What’s obvious to us is not obvious to students.

Consider: You flash a slide showing cell structures and organelles like the following illustration on the screen and begin explaining it to your class:

## Animal Cell

- Nucleolus
- Nuclear Membrane
- Nucleus
- Cytoplasm
- Golgi Apparatus
- Ribosome
- Lysosome
- Endoplasmic Reticulum
- Cell Membrane
- Mitochondrion

As you talk you hold in your mind a thousand implicit understandings: That the cellular organisms are enlarged relative to the size of the cell in the image to make them more visible. That the colors are for the purpose of demonstration, and aren’t realistic. That actual cells are three-dimensional. That animal cells feature huge variety in their shapes, and few if any animal cells are actually *this* shape. That the images of the organelles are supposed to represent cross-sections. That the mitochondria aren’t in

---

<!-- Page 366 -->

fact all the same size. That the organelles are always moving and changing. And on and on.

At best, your students might vaguely understand a few of these things. More likely they'd know none of them. But you wouldn't think to mention them in your explanation of the diagram because what they don't understand is hidden from you. For all intents and purposes, you and your students are looking at different diagrams.³ What's obvious to an expert is hidden to a novice, even in terms of perception.

In fact I generated my list of what an expert understands about a cell diagram with the help of dozens of colleagues on Twitter.⁴ What was obvious to a biology teacher and not to students? I asked. Most people contributed one or two of these ideas. Nobody saw all of them, and there were more suggestions than I could keep track of.

Combine this with the Dunning-Kruger Effect, the tendency of unskilled individuals to overestimate how much they know, and you have “an unwitting conspiracy,” writes Greg Ashman. “The teacher thinks their students understand and the students think they understand, and they don't understand.”

There's no reliable “cure” for the curse of knowledge. Perceiving subtle hints of confusion in your students' countenances can suggest that maybe you've overlooked something, so prepare your lessons well and keep your working memory free to observe students. Experience also helps: You develop intuitions about students and their misunderstandings from years of hearing them say wonderful things like, “That can't be the mitochondria—it's not orange!” during a lab. But it will always plague us. Still, there are two things you can do in terms of teaching methods that make you more likely to instill successful

---

<!-- Page 367 -->

understandings in students' minds and to avoid massive misunderstandings or simple failures of learning.

The first is to break up new material into steps and teach and practice them sequentially. The second is the use of annotated models or work samples instead of rubrics to help students develop an understanding of the parts of a complex task.

Perhaps consciousness, too, is curative. Teachers should always be on the lookout for any points they may have overlooked, which may be obvious to them but a source of confusion to students. You have listed the hard vocabulary words in the chapter and taught them, but there are some simpler words that confuse your students. You understand that two events happened a hundred years apart but your students lack your chronology and think they happened at roughly the same time. What exactly the points of confusion will turn out to be remains a mystery. That they exist is a very good bet.

# THE GUIDANCE FADING EFFECT

Novices learn differently from experts. This is one of the most important findings of educational psychologists and, as far as I can tell, one of the least recognized by educational theorists. The tendency of novices to benefit from more direct guidance and experts to get more from problem-solving situations, cognitive psychologist John Sweller calls *the guidance fading effect*. “Students should initially be given lots of explicit guidance to reduce their working memory load, which assists in transferring knowledge to long-term memory,” he writes. “Once students are more knowledgeable, that guidance is unnecessary and … should be faded out and replaced by problem-solving.” This is both useful and unusual guidance. (Unusual because Sweller does not propose one inherently

---

<!-- Page 368 -->

better methodology for every situation. He seems to have heeded Dylan Wiliam's admonition “Everything works somewhere and nothing works everywhere.”)

Open-ended problem-solving activities play an important role. So does direct instruction. The answer to the question of which to use is: It depends. But what it depends on most, Sweller tells us, is the degree of knowledge about the topic among students, and here it is important to recognize that outside of a university setting students are most often novices and, further, that people go back and forth between novice and more knowledgeable states frequently, even within a subject. On Friday, at the end of a well-taught and organized unit, your students may be fairly knowledgeable; then they start a new unit on Monday and move back to square one again. This would imply different teaching techniques for each day.

Consider an experience one of my own children had building a model rocket in Science class. One day my daughter announced with no small degree of excitement that they were going to be building and flying rockets in class later that week. “Great,” I said, “Are you studying air resistance? Or aerodynamics?” That sounded super-geeky, so I rephrased: “You know, the sort of things that might make a rocket fly better.”

“I'm not really sure,” she said, “We haven't yet. I think it's the introduction to a new unit.”

A few days later I asked her how the rocketry lesson went. “Great,” she said. They had made the rockets out of paper and gone out to the back fields to fly them. “Our team won!” she told me breathlessly—meaning that her group's rocket had stayed aloft the longest. “Double-cool,” I said, “What made your rocket work so well?” I asked.

---

<!-- Page 369 -->

“I'm not really sure,” she said. “I think maybe our wings. They looked different from other people's.”

“Oh,” I said. What had she and her teammates tried to do with them? How were they different?

Silence.

If their wings had been better, in other words, it had been a lucky guess, which was fun and memorable but not all that instructive. They hadn't been testing an idea—“Hey, since we know X, let's see if …” It wasn't an application of knowledge, in other words.

I should be clear: I liked the rocket activity. It was fun and inspiring and typical of why my daughter loves science. But it would have taught her more to do it after she was no longer a rank novice. A few lessons on the principles of air resistance followed by some small experiments with different wing shapes would have helped. Or, to capitalize on the rockets as a “hook,”⁵ you might fire them twice—once to make some conjectures at the beginning, and then again after students know enough to cement their knowledge and ask: “What do you notice now that you didn't know when we first fired the rockets?”

If students have knowledge they can use it to describe, explain, and perceive why some rockets fly better than others:

*We had larger wings with more surface area or*

*Maybe it was the size of the nose cone that created less air resistance.*

The value of hands-on learning, in other words, correlates to how much students know when they engage in it. To use hands-on activities before you've shared knowledge overlooks the differences between how experts and novices learn.

---

<!-- Page 370 -->

Watch the video *Michael Towne: Red Dye from Stretch It* (technique 17) again and notice how, as Michael drops dye into water of two different temperatures, his students apply knowledge that he has taught them. They are able to see what's happening because they have the prior knowledge to do so.

“Present new material in small steps with student practice after each step,” advises Barak Rosenshine in *Principles of Instruction*, his guide to teacher effectiveness. This takes time but is worth it. It makes the implicit explicit for students and uses practice to consolidate understanding before working memory is overloaded. This, cognitive psychologists suggest, is the way students learn best when they are not experts. “Teaching in small steps requires time, and the more effective teachers [in studies] spent more time presenting new material and guiding student practice than did the less effective teachers,” Rosenshine notes. “In a study of mathematics instruction, for instance, the most effective mathematics teachers spent about twenty-three minutes of a forty-minute period in lecture, demonstration, questioning, and working examples.” In contrast, less effective teachers spent only eleven minutes methodically explaining and practicing new material, Rosenshine notes.

Working memory is quickly overloaded by too much new material at once. Solution: Break down what you're doing into steps. Take the steps one by one. Let students practice each one. As they practice, ask questions of two different types: conceptual (what are we doing?) and procedural questions (how do we do it?), going back and forth between the two when possible.

The video *Rachel Boothman: We Are Solving* provides an excellent model of Rosenshine's idea of methodically explaining and practicing new material as well as the idea

---

<!-- Page 371 -->

of going back and forth between procedural and conceptual questions.

“When we are solving it means we are finding the value of the letter. So we want x on its own and we have solved the equation,” Rachel begins, reminding her class of a key definition. Then she asks a procedural question to start: “What's my first step here?”

Brandon answers and Rachel asks a conceptual question: “What is the mathematical name for what Brandon has just done?”

Moments later she's back to procedural questions, *Cold Calling* Ella and then Arian to ask, “What do I do next?”

“OK, this time we are simplifying,” she says as she moves on to a new problem. Now she starts conceptually: “Who can tell me another word for simplifying?” She gets a correct answer, finding like terms, so asks Karis, “So here where are our like terms?

Karis has left off the negative sign and Rachel asks, “Can anyone improve on Karis's answer?” But of course there are multiple sets of like terms so she asks Azaria for another set. After these conceptual questions—What are like terms? How can I spot them?—she goes back to procedural questions, asking Hannah to add -3x and 5x and Ellis whether she can simplify any further. When he answers correctly, she asks a conceptual question: “What do I mean when I say index? What's the index here?”

Later, after students have mastered concepts, a less methodical approach might well work, but remember this caution: Our own memories of our experiences as learners sometimes work against us. We remember moments that were unforgettable to us later in our studies. They were unstructured. We were granted the opportunity to explore. Suddenly: an epiphany. Perhaps you still remember walking

<!-- Page 372 -->

out of some building on campus after a class in your major with your mind exploding. Surely if you re-created this activity for your students it would be equally profound. Surely it would add rigor to your class. The challenge is that you were an expert when you explored your way to this insight. You were perceiving far more meaning in each interaction than a novice would. Your students will eventually get to a place where they, too, will derive profound benefit from the open-ended exercise. But until they know more, they are likely to get less out of the experience than you did, and adding it to your lesson won't necessarily make your class equally profound and memorable to your students.

# WORK SAMPLES VERSUS RUBRICS

The message so far: Introduce new content in discrete steps, interleaved with practice and reflection to allow students to manage the load on working memory and gradually begin encoding ideas in long-term memory. But what about content that can't be easily broken into sequential steps? Writing an essay or painting a watercolor, say. They are still tasks that involve mastery of separate elements, but they cannot be easily broken into steps.

One solution is to share an annotated exemplar marked up by the teacher for students to study. In *Embedding Formative Assessment*, Dylan Wiliam and Siobhan Leahy suggest replacing the commonly used rubrics with “work samples” as tools to explain how to complete tasks successfully. This is interesting in part because rubrics, carefully crafted but relatively abstract descriptions of the characteristics of high-quality work, are full of things that are obvious to experts and hidden to novices. They “rarely have the same meaning for students that they do for teachers,” Wiliam and Leahy note. For example, a common

---

<!-- Page 373 -->

rubric might note that a proficient essay “uses words and phrases, telling details, and sensory language to convey a vivid picture of the experiences, events, settings, and/or characters.” But what does it mean to use telling details and sensory language if you are a novice, and how do you determine their quality? An “inadequate” essay, according to the rubric, “merely tells experiences, events, settings, and/or characters.” So the difference is that a better essay uses sensory language and is vivid. Do students know what vivid language looks like? Do they know if their language is sensory? What would it mean in their minds to write in sensory language? Would it make the essay better if the author suddenly dropped in details about things he or she smelled and tasted? It might just as likely sound absurd. Instead, Wiliam and Leahy suggest looking at high-quality examples that include explanations of *how key elements were created*. Such a work might point out several passages that included vivid language or sensory detail. With a series of concrete examples, a novice now might really understand what it looks like and see how to embed it in a larger work. How are sensory details effectively included so they are not just greater in quantity but better in quality?⁶ Essentially, you are building a mental model for students so they can imagine and understand the component parts of the end product. The idea that the starting point for an assignment could be public work sampling—rather than abstract rubrics—is compelling. The key is to make the work samples concrete—to guide students through three or four examples of key elements, and then allow them to practice them discretely.⁷ This might result in several shorter exercises—studies—where students seek to master various parts, or solve smaller problems before composing a larger work. This is in fact how many of the great masters worked. Their canvases are the product of study after study in which

---

<!-- Page 374 -->

solutions to the painting’s component problems are modeled. Figure out the light and shadow on the house in the foreground first. Then sketch the figures in the field and explore how you’ll use shading. Several times, perhaps. Then put them together.

An exceptional example of this was provided to me by Nina Troiano, then an Art teacher at Troy Prep Middle School in Troy, New York. I was always stunned by the quality of student work in the hallways at the school and observed several of Nina’s lessons. Typically she would build skills and knowledge progressively through a series of exercises leading up to a final piece. Here’s her process for breaking down the process of painting formation as she described one project to me.

“It’s a pretty academic first day,” she said. “We started by reading about the artist in the *Do Now*—maybe two paragraphs with questions to answer. We discussed her approach and then we looked at one of her drawings.”

---

<!-- Page 375 -->

> “We talked about why she did what she did and we were pulling out elements we'd use in our projects through guided discussion,” Nina said.

> “I was trying to allow the kids to give their own spin on what I think was a really eerie approach to landscape.8 We talked about how the house was isolated, and that there were no people. But also that there were strange elements like a ladder up to a window that made you realize there might have been activity at one point. It made you realize there were no people but there should be. We talked about how the houses and trees were stylized and the houses were drawn in two-point perspective, but a distorted imperfect version of that.”

Here Nina was essentially annotating an exemplar, telling her students: Here is a model of a possible finished work.

---

<!-- Page 376 -->

Here are some of the key elements that make it powerful.  
Here are words to describe those things.

Next Nina's kids practiced, a lot, before they tried to produce a final drawing. “The first day, we all draw together. We start with a house. We go step by step and break the house apart into shapes and angles and lines and what each line is doing. For example, to make the house look as if it's receding in space, the front edge would be longer and then gradually narrows toward the back. So I draw it and we copy it together. After they've done that, it starts to make sense. Then I give them half-complete houses that they have to complete. It becomes more independent. Toward the end they draw a full house. Then we start adding horizon lines and landscape details.” By the end of the first day Nina's students have done multiple sketches and drawings of the houses that they may put in their final project.

On day two they practiced the elements of landscape, especially the trees, in the same way. And on subsequent days they got more practice. “On day two for the *Do Now* we start with what we did previously. I had a half-drawn house for them to complete. On day three I gave them a house and they had to add the landscape with stylized trees,” Nina said.

After a few days of practicing sketching the elements, students did a final draft. “I tell them it's like a test. They have to show that they understand the points that we've hit. There are composition requirements: one house; at least four stylized trees, all of the tress with cast shadows, all of them pointing in the correct direction, aligned with the sun; a mysterious element that suggests missing people. Then they could think about color. They draw a first draft with crayons and colored pencils. They use that to

---

<!-- Page 377 -->

guide their final copy. But before that, we do demos with oil pastels. How to get a vibrant color. How to blend.”

You can see in the story how Nina builds up knowledge piece by piece, helping students to not only understand how to successfully create a larger complex work but also develop skills and knowledge they can apply in future paintings and drawings. In part, this is about managing student's working memory. By allowing them to apply all of their conscious thought in a sustained way to a smaller task she helps them make each element special and the overall result memorable. Certainly the resulting works were full of creativity and self-expression, but there's also such immense respect for the knowledge of craft implicit in being able to create and express. Did students enjoy it? Overwhelmingly. There was such a sense of competence and confidence. They knew how to create. And of course the degree to which one can bring one's creative vision to reality is a result of the knowledge and skill she has built.

Perhaps my perception is wrong, but I don't often see an approach like this used in art classrooms. Students are most often assigned a painting and they have a go at it all at once.

In her outstanding book *Making Good Progress*, Daisy Christodoulou makes a fascinating point. If teachers don't break down complex tasks into component parts, the alternative is to practice summative tasks as whole exercises. Sort of like doing whole landscape paintings over and over, except that in academic subjects the tasks often become very focused on tested outcomes. That is, teachers do over and over tasks that replicate what students will be assessed on in the end. “Assessment for learning [what teachers in the UK might call data-driven instruction] became excessively focused on exam tasks not just because of the pressures of accountability,” Christodoulou writes,

<!-- Page 378 -->

“but because the dominant theory of how we acquire skill suggested it was the best thing to do.” We blame teaching to the test on the tests when part of the problem is our own conception of teaching. Lessons, she says, should look very different from the final skill they are hoping to instill. The goal is to make what's intuitive to experts legible to novices so they can master it.

## TECHNIQUE 22: BOARD = PAPER

I have a colleague who can still tell me what we said about each classroom we observed during a series of school visits we made more than a decade ago. I know this because once, several years after the visit, she did exactly that, flipping back through a trusty old spiral notebook until she found the date and heading, thumbing down through a tidy transcription of the salient points about each teacher we'd watched until she found the one we were discussing. “Yes,” she confirmed, “we loved her upbeat, positive tone even then.”

I have another colleague who can flip back through her notes and remind everyone what we decided at a meeting or what we thought of a video we watched eighteenth months ago.

Unlike these colleagues, my own notes are more or less useless to me after I have taken them. I never learned (or, more precisely, never built a habit of using) an intentional system of note-taking. Perhaps teachers in my schools assumed my peers and I knew how to take notes, perhaps they thought it was up to us to figure out, but in school my notes then were a mess of hasty scrawls with little organizational structure. This pattern persists to this day, and I find this weakness to be an enduring drain on my productivity.

Taking notes is a critical but easily overlooked skill that allows students to organize and review material over the long run: across a unit, a semester, or a lifetime. And in the short run—that is, during class when they are actively taking notes—the process can cause students to focus and prioritize their attention.

To state the obvious, note-taking is progressive: a habit that builds over time from a simple model in the primary years to something more complex when students are older. At the elementary level, students should know that “written on the board” means it’s important and should be written down by them as well. At the middle school level, they should systematically record the important ideas from the class and differentiate them from less salient points. At the high school level they should leave class with a record of the proceedings that will allow them to study the ideas in depth and with clarity even weeks later.

Perhaps some students do. But too many, likely, will produce haphazard scrawls scattered across the page like I did because the process of learning to make notes is so easily overlooked. Others will not know that *if it’s on the board it matters*. Taking good notes requires and therefore builds attentiveness, and too-brief notes not only will be largely useless later on but also may reflect a fractured state of attention during the lesson. At the other end of the spectrum, some students will try to write everything down and have little attention left to reflect on the ideas from class. They may have little sense for what information was actually important when they return to review. Left uncorrected, each of these untainted note-takers will carry a hidden disadvantage to every classroom they inhabit.

With that in mind, it’s worth watching the video *Sadie McCleary: Board Equals Paper*, a series of moments from Sadie McCleary’s Chemistry lesson at Western Guilford

---

<!-- Page 380 -->

High School in Greensboro, North Carolina, in which she guides her students through the process of creating a written record of the day's learning. As the clip opens, Sadie instructs her students to get a page set up for note-taking. She is clearly modeling and practicing a *method* of note-taking as much as she's seeking to help them master the details of the day's lesson: “You are writing at the top ‘Unit 2: Matter,’” she says. “Today's lesson is lesson 14: *Combined Gas Law*.” The system—with references to units and sequences of lessons—is implicit in the set-up.

After guiding the students through several practice problems, Sadie says, “We're going to write that into our notebook.” Notice the ‘we’ language here and throughout—the clip reminds students: *What I am doing at the board, you are doing at your desk—all of us are doing this together*. You can also see Sadie reach for her own version of a notebook and place it under the LCD projector. She's completing a “worked example”: a high-quality model completed live in front of students in which she comments on the process as she completes it. She models and describes at the same time. It's not trivial that she keeps her own version of a student notebook. At the end she'll have a record of what they have in their notebooks, which Sadie reflects comes in handy to help with absences, lost notebooks, and students in need of study tips. And having a consistent place to take notes is part of the system. She's modeling that, too.

Sadie's pace is stately. “So we'll write P1V1 over T1,” she says, and then leaves a few seconds for students to get that down. “It used to drive me crazy when a teacher said *write this down* but then was already talking about something else when I was trying to do just that,” recalled my colleague John Costello as we screened this video at our offices. “But she goes slowly. There's time to do what she asks.” In part that's because she is making actual notes live

---

<!-- Page 381 -->

rather than, say, projecting a version she created in advance. This causes her to be doubly attentive to pace—she understands the time that students need for tasks because she's doing them herself. That said, only teachers with strong established class cultures can write while still scanning for follow-through and behavior, so while it's ideal to write along with students, having prewritten notes that you narrate is acceptable if your culture is still developing. It will give you less to manage in your own working memory and let you observe more accurately. Just be sure to go slowly. And work toward the sort of live modeling Sadie uses.

Watching this video as a team, we also noted how important planning was. Having a clear sense of what students should write (and possibly even having written out an exemplar version of their notes beforehand to guide you) will help make the notes organized and thoughtful. If you're figuring out how to structure the notes or what to write in real time, the result is likely to be confusion.⁹ In a later interview Sadie noted how important it is for her to think through in advance exactly what she wants in her notebook. Turns out she keeps two! One she fills out in advance, so she knows what to write. The second she completes along with her students so she can model and describe the process to them in real time.

Throughout the video, you'll also notice how carefully Sadie scans to make sure students feel accountable to follow-through. She is sending the message “I care about you getting this down and I'm watching to make sure you do.” As we discuss in *Radar and Be Seen Looking* (technique 53) this makes it so much more likely that the students will, in fact, make sure to get every note down. You can see Sadie looking several times and even carefully adjusting the projector at one point to make sure students can see

---

<!-- Page 382 -->

perfectly. The message is *This has to be just right so you can all get it down perfectly.*

Sadie models a two-part process in which students include both “content' and “commentary” in their notes. She shows them how to write down elements of the lesson and how to mark them up with their own thoughts and reminders. At one point you can see Sadie model for her students how and where to include marginalia and commentary, such as labeling one part of the equation “initial” and adding side notes about how to use the formula: “It must be the same gas” and “No added or removed particles.”

Here's a side note about the video, based on a conversation that came up in our team's screening of the video: *How can we prepare students to take notes on laptops in college?* One of the most important parts of this video to me is that Sadie is modeling handwritten notes. Recent data10 has made it pretty clear that handwriting your notes leads to greater recall than typing your notes. You remember more, think more deeply, and are less likely to be distracted by other things that pop up when your laptop is open. The more students work by hand, the better, so I think my response is to prepare students not to take notes on laptops, if possible. I'd be transparent about this, and remind them of the benefits of handwriting their notes—presently and when they get to college and in a university setting.11

Seeing Sadie's work with her high school Chemistry students is powerful, but as I noted before *Board = Paper* involves “progressive habits that build up from the primary to the university years.” What skills and habits should a classroom reinforce when students are younger?

Begin with the idea that students should know to track what the teacher is writing on the board. When a teacher

---

<!-- Page 383 -->

writes it on the board, it means *This is important.*[^12] Students should know to write it down.

The best way to start students on the path to autonomous note-taking is to make your overhead a mirror image of the graphic organizer you give to students to take notes on. As you fill in a blank, they fill in a corresponding blank. You fill out the projected worksheet on the board and say, “Make your paper look like mine.” Even as students earn more autonomy, having your overhead match the format in which they are taking notes allows you to model what note-taking—one of the most important skills for any student—should look like.

Gradually, students should develop note-taking independence, filling out longer and longer passages of their graphic organizers on their own, before you ultimately ask them to take notes on a separate sheet of paper as Sadie does. But know that it may take time before students are ready to take full responsibility for such a critical piece of the process and that along the way they’ll need lots of feedback. At her previous school, Sadie notes, when students got to the point where they were simply taking their own notes without guidance, she used to collect class notes to give them feedback and/or to share exemplars to compare their own notes to.

## TECHNIQUE 23: ACCOUNTABLE INDEPENDENT READING

Independent reading is critical to student success in every subject. It is a base operating system that supports nearly every academic endeavor. Even a problem-set in math assesses, in some part, students' ability to independently read a short passage about drawing colored beans

---

<!-- Page 384 -->

randomly out of a bag or the details of how many lawns Tyson mowed when.

As they progress toward adulthood, advanced study, and professional careers, students must be able to read complex texts specific to each discipline independently, even when those texts are challenging. To be a lawyer, a scientist, or an engineer is to be prepared for texts not necessarily designed to engage the reader or yield their meaning easily. If students cannot sit down and successfully make thorough sense of such texts on their own, their horizons will be constrained.

Maryanne Wolf points out in *Reader Come Home* that independent reading is also critical to building the capacity to sustain attention and concentration.[13] Learning to read deeply and well “rewires the brain,” she says, creating “sophisticated neural circuits” capable of reflection, concentration, and empathy. A fractured half-attentive society shouting at one another, in other words, is one outcome of a culture that does not read much.

And young people increasingly do not read. A 2020 study by the Literacy Trust in England found the lowest rates of student independent reading so far recorded.[14] When students do read, they typically read in states of distraction: on the couch with a smart phone buzzing away on their stomach, say.[15] To read and half-attend or vaguely understand is an increasingly normal cognitive state. Being distracted trips no internal alarms.

Providing periods of sustained, focused independent reading, especially with challenging texts, is among the most valuable things teachers can do in school, in every subject, and at every grade level. For many students, school is increasingly the only place this activity is likely to happen—there are few other places safe from the reach of technological distraction.[16]

<!-- Page 385 -->

However, many teachers don't ask students to read in class because students don't do it productively or they—or their administrators—don't think of it as a form of teaching.

**Accountable Independent Reading (AIR)** is a set of tools to ensure that independent reading during class is successful and productive. It has three tenets. First, assign reading in smaller durations at first in order to make adaptive decisions based on how well students read an initial sample (or samples). Second, assess intentionally, ideally through observable tasks, to make decisions about how effectively or how much of a given text students can read on their own. Third, embed the reading within the arc of the instruction so it is not a separate activity but rather one where ideas apply and connect to the rest of the lesson.

Much of the rationale for this approach comes from the recognition that students' ability to read independently is not static—it depends on the text they are reading and varies given their own background knowledge and experience with different forms of syntax.17

Further, the goal is for students to read attentively and with understanding when they read as much as it is to increase the amount of their reading. The habit we want to build is of focused attentive reading.

You can see an example of this in the video *Nicholas Hermann: Forces*. Nick has added an article to his lesson plan for his fifth-grade Science students to read. Great idea. Scientific texts read differently from other writing. It's great practice for students to read within the discipline. The article describes the forces that affect the flight of a baseball. Nicholas is very clear that they're going to start with just four paragraphs. He wants to make sure they can spot the two forces (gravity and air resistance) acting on the ball. He's prepped the text in advance, so the segment

---

<!-- Page 386 -->

is easy for students to see “You're going to stop right next to that number three.” His annotation task—put a box around the two forces acting on the baseball—allows him to clearly see if students are able to comprehend this kind of scientific writing.

Why that can be difficult is deftly revealed by the second round of AIR he assigns: *read the next section and place a star next to the line that explains how a scientific law is different from a government law.* “Law” is an apparently simple word that means something different in a scientific context, just the kind of barrier to understanding that the “curse of knowledge” might cause a teacher to overlook. But with two careful tests like this Nicholas will know: Can I give my students longer reading assignments? Can they learn reliably from this kind of reading? If they can, he can pause during a typical lesson and, rather than saying, “Let me explain to you how electricity works,” he can say, “Let me give you a short article that will explain how electricity works,” and let reading passages be one of his core teaching tools. If not, they will need more practice.

You can see a slightly more complex example in the video *Kirby Jarrell: A Doubtful Freedom*. Students in her seventh-grade class are reading *The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass*. It's a challenging text, to say the least —published in 1845, Douglass's syntax is challenging to modern ears. His writing is rich in complex imagery and often employs a formal rhetorical style rarely seen today. But it is also a critical text for students to read. There is no other way to understand the book save to hear Douglass's voice directly. The text is both complex and necessary.

As the clip opens, Kirby's class has just read aloud. “It was so obvious from the way you read that aloud that you really understood it,” she says. This small moment shows us that Kirby is already using students' fluency and expression in

---

<!-- Page 387 -->

oral reading as data to inform choices about how ready students are to read this passage independently.18

Kirby asks students to read on their own to the end of the section for about two minutes and to make notes about the “lists” Douglass makes—these are critical to understanding the passage. In assigning a visible annotation task, Kirby sets out to assess students’ status as independent readers —not just generally, but of *this* portion of *this* book.

Because she's given them a specific annotation task, Kirby is able to use *Active Observation* (technique 9) to note trends in comprehension, and as the timer winds down she is optimistic, “Awesome job. You don't need a partner,” she says, deciding to skip a planned *Turn and Talk* (technique 43). Instead she launches into a whole-group discussion. “What is he listing, and why?” she asks.

The subsequent discussion is meant to stamp the understanding students should have gleaned independently from the text, but the text is tricky, and it quickly emerges that not everyone understood as fully as Kirby thought. One student explains that Douglass is listing the challenges he faced while escaping, and Kirby calls on another student to clarify that the lists are hypothetical—none of the challenges listed had actually happened yet. This passage, critically, involves Douglass imagining the risks of escape.

But Kirby is alert to the indications of struggle and asks students to jot a note at the bottom of the page capturing the idea that Douglass is *imagining* in this section. They're doing well in the face of real challenge, but she'll have to be careful about how much she gives them to read on their own. Being able to fly solo with such a challenging book is still a work in progress.

As the clip closes, she says, “I just want to emphasize, it's been [only a few] weeks [since they started the novel] and just think about how well you're understanding this book …

---

<!-- Page 388 -->

what was that like for you? ... I think a lot of us are really able to figure out Douglass's tough language.” This might seem like a contradictory thing to say after students have struggled with a key point, but both things are true.

They have made incredible progress. They are often able to read successfully from an immensely challenging text. But tricky passages will emerge. A book's “level of difficulty” is an average. Within it there are sections students can breeze through and sections of special difficulty. To say that students can read a book independently is always a generalization. There are several elements Kirby uses to ensure this segment of independent reading is productive.

First there is the gradual release in the length of the independent reading: starting small and increasing the amount of text as your confidence in students' comprehension grows. If Kirby's students had read the bulk of a chapter instead of starting as they did with just a paragraph or two, it would have been much harder for Kirby to lock in on their understanding of this passage and to use it as a test of their readiness to read similar passages solo. In the long run we want to build students' stamina for independent reading tasks, but it may take time before we know that students are up to the task of reading extended passages with accuracy.

Kirby's clear and specific annotation task—“What is he listing, and why?”—is key. Giving students a focal point allows you to monitor comprehension while they work. For younger students, this might sound like what you hear Dan Cosgrove say in the video *Dan Cosgrove: Earthworm*: “Meet me at the top of page 56 and jot one word to show how the earthworm is feeling.” In a history class, you might prompt, “Underline at least two details about the conditions faced by Revolutionary War soldiers.” Having a clear task also benefits students, guiding them to

---

<!-- Page 389 -->

concentrate on the most important parts of the text by giving them something concrete to pay attention to while reading.

One important caveat on annotation tasks: It’s easy to make the annotation task too complex or too vague. What we want is a task that clearly reveals whether students understood, not just the gist, but the specific language of the passage. The task should therefore be specific to understanding a particular section of text rather than the application of a universal skill. “In this paragraph, underline the three ways memory can be manipulated or changed” is better than “In this paragraph underline three examples of figurative language.” A student can complete the second task and not understand what they’ve read. The goal in designing annotation tasks is to give yourself data on whether students understood with precision what the author is trying to say so you know how much they can read on their own.

One benefit of short and medium doses of AIR is that they allow you to integrate reading into the arc of your lesson and send the message that independent reading is one of the ways we engage content together during class and not just something we do after class and on our own. To have everyone read a passage independently and then discuss it or write about it makes reading a part of the learning process. As Nicholas Hermann’s video shows, this is especially valuable outside of reading classes. Learning to read the discourse of the sciences independently and seeing reading as intrinsic to the process of learning about science is a necessity for any STEM career, for example.

A last thought on AIR. Does it always look like this? Must you always methodically assess students' readiness and release them only to what you know they can do successfully? No. The accountability is something you often

---

<!-- Page 390 -->

use to understand and support your students' ability to read complex texts. There are times when independent reading can take other forms—students should choose and read books on their own, of course; sometimes they should struggle with a challenging text and reflect on what they initially missed or didn't fully comprehend. But AIR reminds us of how important it is to constantly assess students as independent readers so we understand the experience they are having when they read.

And AIR can help students understand the reading process better too. Like Kirby, you may opt to be transparent about your decision-making process (for example, “My sense is that we're still figuring Steinbeck out. We're going to keep reading independently in small chunks until we're a bit more familiar with his style and voice,” or “This description of photosynthesis includes a lot of technical vocabulary, so you're just going to read the first two paragraphs on your own.”) It also allows for celebration of success, as we can see in Kirby's clip: “That was a challenge, and you did it.” This language of celebration is a way to embrace challenge and show that success brings additional autonomy: “We're really starting to get Steinbeck. I'm going to challenge you to do more on your own,” or “You did a great job summarizing the section on photosynthesis—let's see how you do in this next chapter, which goes a little deeper.”

# TECHNIQUE 24: FASE READING

*FASE Reading*, or, as it was formerly known, *Control the Game*, is a system for student read-alouds that maximizes the value and viability of this crucial activity, allowing you to build students’ fluency in and enjoyment of reading. It has always been in the top tier of techniques in the book in terms of importance, but society is undergoing rapid and dramatic changes, the most significant of which involve the

---

<!-- Page 391 -->

omnipresence of technology, and these have elevated even further the importance—I might even say urgency—of an intentional approach to reading in the classroom that includes the use of *FASE Reading*. This is, in my mind, one of the handful of most important techniques in the book.

What does FASE mean? It's an acronym, and even though I'm not crazy about acronyms, the previous name was obscure,¹⁹ and this technique needed a new name that communicated something important about the technique. The previous name communicated important things about the technique mostly to me and me alone.

The new name, FASE, is intended to remind teachers about four things they should try to reinforce when students read aloud. It also sounds a bit like “phase” and this can be a reminder that it often happens in a cycle of a few minutes that yields to other activities and then is used again later. A phase—like *FASE Reading*—is often temporary but recurring.

**F is for fluency.** Fluency is hugely important for readers at all levels. We want to use *FASE Reading* as an opportunity to build it. This is because, as Student Achievement Partners note in a recent white paper, “Research shows dysfluency causes as much as 40% of the variance in students who pass [state] tests versus those who fail. This is true for every testing grade.”²⁰ You don't have to like tests to get the point: Comprehension and understanding require fluency. You must read not just individual words but strings of words at the speed of sight²¹—with automaticity that is, so that your full working memory is free to think about the text. One of the least contemplated, obvious things about reading is that it has to happen fast—“at the speed of sight,” as Mark Seidenberg puts it—for it to work. We have to be able to make sense of it as soon as we perceive it. If you're asking a student about the author's

---

<!-- Page 392 -->

craft or what exactly the experiment says about the role of ATP and they can't process the words and syntax at the speed of sight, you're likely to be disappointed. When you have to slow down to read, when the task of reading and making basic sense of the words requires conscious thinking, your working memory is allocated to figuring out the words, what they mean, and how they fit together, not to comprehending. Perhaps this is why the students who got fluency instruction—both those in regular classrooms and those who were struggling readers—“simply read better” than those who did not get regular work on fluency, writes Timothy Shanahan, who is among the nation's foremost researchers on reading. “For many students oral reading fluency practice continues to help in the consolidation of decoding skills [and] … helps to support prosody development which is more directly implicated in reading comprehension.”22

Reading aloud is critical to building fluency. It is the only reliable way to assess it and it provides students with the opportunity to practice the meaning making we express when we read aloud. To read something aloud is to interpret it and make arguments about it: In what tone should it be read? Which word gets emphasized? Think for a moment of how critical it is to know what the implicit voice of a text sounds like, not just for novels but for scientific research and historiography; now think of how often your students have heard those things read aloud. With FASE reading there’s constant modeling of how a text should sound but the model comes from fellow students. I will return to this when we discuss the social aspects of reading.

Reading aloud is the best way to practice fluency and it's beneficial for *all learners*, but once they have finished the elementary grades students no longer get opportunities to read aloud and build fluency. This gap is ten times more

---

<!-- Page 393 -->

important now when—and this will be another motif of this book—reading as we know it is locked in a death struggle with the cell phone, a battle it is losing badly. It's not just that students read less and less—the data are devastating—it's that they read less and less well. They are more distracted; in states of constant half-attention,23 their eyes flitting down the page looking for the next new thing. So it's not just that we build fluency and reading skills that translate into silent reading as well, it's that it is one of the few ways we can cause students to read for sustained, undistracted periods of time.

## A is for accountability.

“The only way we can ever 100% know that a child is actually reading is if they are reading aloud,” Jo Facer writes in *Simplicity Rules*. And it's the only way we can know *how* they are reading. Your class reading aloud is not just fluency practice, it's not just an exercise in creating community (which I’ll come to in a moment), it's a constant data stream on the reading level of your students on the key texts of your classroom. Nothing could be more data driven.

Making sure students are reading is a big deal—bigger now than five or ten years ago. Yes, I can hear some teachers saying, we should socialize students to read at home as much as we can. But note also that relying on reading happening at home is in part regressive—the strong readers are likely to get more of it—and we increasingly can't be sure that many students read steadily outside of school. We are all addicts to a device engineered to absorb our full attention. Our students are in its thrall the minute they leave school.24 “Any and all systems I have ever come up with [to ensure independent reading at home] have been gamed by students … If you want to ensure pupils are reading, your only bet is to make them do it with you, as a whole class. That's why things like whole class reading of a suitable novel … for 20 to 30 minutes a day are so

---

<!-- Page 394 -->

beneficial. If children have read that much for that long, they will have a massive advantage over their peers,” Facer writes.

## S is for social.

This is the hidden gift of *FASE Reading*. Shared experiences, especially ones with emotional weight or where significant ideas emerge, draw people into communities and give them a sense of belonging. This is what you are doing when you read together—building community and belonging and, not coincidentally, this is in part the role stories and texts have played in our society for longer than there have been schools. Stories and experiences were shared not just among groups but *in groups* as a way to draw people together. It is fitting that this aspect of reading may be our best bet now to elevate its stature above the lonelier forms of communication available through screens.

In *Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain*, Zaretta Hammond makes a compelling case for the importance of community in the classroom. We are the most individualist society on earth, she notes. Finding ways to balance ardent individualism with a communal approach is part of culturally responsive teaching—a key way to make the classroom more accessible to students from less individualistic cultures, she argues. At the same time it pushes us to see the benefits of greater emphasis on community and belonging conferred upon some other cultures that value it more highly.

The way we read sometimes reflects that ardent individualism, especially in moments where everyone chooses their own book and reads it on their own. There’s a common argument that students will only love reading if it involves individual choice and while some choice is nice,25 everyone always choosing their own thing means giving up what is collective—the shared text we can all talk about

---

<!-- Page 395 -->

because we've all read it and shared the experience of reading it together. One of the benefits of a collective task like reading together is that it builds belonging, the strongest incentive for humans there is. Ironically, reading and experiencing together often yields more enjoyment than does a setting where everyone gets choice. The moment when your class laughs or gasps aloud in the midst of a shared reading, a bond is made. The experience of reading together is as powerful to the brain as events experienced together and thus the shared connection it creates can help forge a lasting and valuable sense of community and belonging. If we want the experience of reading to be powerful and unique—social, shared, and pleasurable, more powerful than the smartphone—the key is to read communally and to emphasize that by reading aloud together.

## E is for expressive.

To read aloud well is to make meaning audible, to breathe life into a text. It's powerful when a teacher does this and it's even more meaningful when students do. It is a statement—peer to peer—that the text is worth bringing to life. To hear your peers take pride in their reading skills and show they value reading creates the sort of positive social norm that is most likely to shift reading behaviors. When students read aloud expressively, and when, as they do in the best classrooms, they implicitly compete to show who can read most expressively—they are not only bringing what you are reading to life, they are making the case for the book. Gabby Woolf does an exemplary job of this in the video *Gabby Woolf: Keystone*. Her class is reading *Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde*, Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 novella, which is full of archaic and unfamiliar syntax. To successfully bring it to life is to show that you understand the book. So as she begins, first modeling herself before she calls on students to *FASE Read*, she challenges students to bring out their maximum

---

<!-- Page 396 -->

degree of expressiveness. “In the spirit of being sensationalist, we want to read it as … Stevenson would want his readers to imagine it.” She encourages her pupils to volunteer “with your highly expressive reading” and notes, “I know several of you who would make a very good job of that.” And indeed the subsequent reading by her students is rich in expression and meaning made audible.

# The Challenges of Reading Aloud

There is joy and pleasure in reading aloud but there are also challenges, and these are also worth addressing because in many ways the purpose of *FASE Reading* is to address those challenges26—it's a classic case of technique making strategy viable. If you have the technique that allows you to overcome a few challenges, the benefits of a powerful strategy become feasible.

So what are the challenges? The reasons can be grouped in two primary buckets: leverage concerns and self-esteem concerns.

## Leverage Concerns

Some educators react to suggestions that they include more oral reading in class with a question along these lines: “Why would you allow a single student to read aloud during class time? What are the other kids doing?” The implication is, I guess: nothing. Having a lone student reading aloud to an otherwise passive classroom can indeed be a poor use of time. And of course it's possible that the reader's peers could be checked out and gazing out the window. But in a well-designed lesson, they would be reading, too, and this is both valuable and relatively easy to accomplish.

I use the term “leverage” to refer to how much reading the rest of the class is doing when one student is reading

---

<!-- Page 397 -->

aloud. If twenty-seven students are staring into space or listening passively, the leverage is low. But if one student is reading actively and twenty-seven students are listening carefully and reading along with her, as actively engaged in the text as if they were reading independently, then the leverage is much higher. It's also worth reflecting on the ease with which a group of people can discuss a text meaningfully when they have just experienced it together. There are no reminders: *remember the scene where this or that happened?* The memory of the scene is vivid in students' minds when you say, “Let's pause here and discuss.” So a second answer to the question “What are the other students doing?” is: They are preparing to discuss. Concerns about the passivity of nonreaders are legitimate, but they're fairly easily managed by specific teacher actions, which I'll discuss in a moment.

I've also heard concerns raised that both listening and reading along at the same time will overload students' working memory—that listening will prevent reading along—or vice versa. I'm not sure there's a clear answer to that, though there's a fair amount of recent research showing that the visual and auditory channels are additive in terms of working memory.27 Still, we can't rule out this concern. That said, reading is an immensely complex task that we use to serve a wide range of outcomes in the classroom. Among other things, we want students to learn decoding and fluency and vocabulary through reading. We want them to acquire knowledge through reading and be able to acquire knowledge through further reading of complex texts in particular. We want them to persist in reading, make a habit of it, and value it all their lives. It's unrealistic to think that any single approach is going to optimize that many diverse outcomes. Reading remains to me the first among equals—the most important among all the valuable things we teach in school—and my guidance would be to

---

<!-- Page 398 -->

have students read a lot in class, to have them read in ways that make a text feel valuable—buy-in, a colleague of mine says, is an outcome, not a precondition for any activity—and use a variety of ways of reading so that you get the benefit of multiple approaches.

In designing our *Reading Reconsidered Curriculum*, my team included three forms of reading in each lesson: *Teacher Read Aloud*, *FASE Reading*, and *Accountable Independent Reading* (see *technique 23*). The exact balance we suggest depends on the teacher, the class, and the text. But we suggest healthy doses of all three. (That's not advice I'd limit to the ELA classroom.) The video *Eric Snider: The Wind* is a great example of a teacher using all three ways of reading in synergy: Eric reads aloud, allows his students to read for a stretch—they crush it with the complex text, by the way—and then sends them off to (accountable) independent reading. If there's a weakness to any of those forms of reading, he balances them by using the others and still reaps the unique benefits of each approach.

## Self-Esteem Concerns

Some educators have also suggested that students should not be asked to read aloud in class because they might struggle—this might shame or embarrass them, and possibly cause them to dislike reading. Essentially, the argument is that if students are weak readers, we should withhold from them one of the best tools for improving reading skills because it might cause them discomfort. Learning to be comfortable struggling is, in my mind, a much more manageable and temporary challenge than being a weak reader. Teachers, and the cultures they build, are fully capable of making it safe to struggle and take risks. It's yet another reason why building a vibrant,

---

<!-- Page 399 -->

positive culture—not just avoiding a negative culture—is so critical in the classroom.

And fortunately everyone's reading is imperfect! So one critical step is to make this simple fact more evident. Balancing teacher read-alouds with student read-alouds is a great way to do this. If you read aloud you will surely make your share of stumbles and bobbles. I know I do. Not trying to hide them but instead making them seem normal is powerful. You could say “Whoops, let me start that sentence over,” or “Whoops, that's ‘flawed,’ not ‘flamed.’” Or you could say very little and just carry on as if it were the most normal thing in the world and let the data settle in on the class over time: Even the teacher stumbles. Having lots of students read also affords lots of opportunities for lots of students to stumble a bit, go back, reread, figure out a word—all of it public and in full view, even among the best readers. This normalizes an obvious aspect of reading that is otherwise hidden to students. The key is not to make weaker students feel like they should not stumble but to help them see that everyone does.

But of course some readers struggle more than others and it is precisely those students who struggle most who also benefit most from the practice. Planning, preparation, and culture building can address the challenges of this. Later I'll share with you a moment in Jessica Bracey's classroom where she demonstrates some excellent solutions. But first, this advice from Jo Facer: She writes that, initially, it is best to “select short, simple sentences before you teach your lesson, and underline or highlight these on your own copy. That way you will know the ‘safe sentences’ to get your struggling readers to succeed with.” Over time this will allow them to meet with success and build their confidence, she notes.

---

<!-- Page 400 -->

One observation implicit in this comment is the idea that people change—not only their skills but also their perceptions. You cannot control whether a student is nervous at first. But you can control environmental variables sufficiently to change that feeling in time.

There are of course other ways to manage the experience so that students gradually get better at reading by reading aloud. I’ll return to those in a moment. But for now I want to also point out that denying all students the opportunity to read aloud because some students might at first be nervous is wrong. All students deserve the right to connect with reading as a positive experience and teachers must ensure that all students develop mastery of the skill.

# How to Lead **FASE** Reading

How then do you unlock the benefits of student oral reading and mitigate its downsides? How do you ensure leverage and attentiveness and prepare for strugglers? When you lead **FASE** Reading, you ask students to read aloud, one by one, in an unpredictable pattern, usually for short durations, at least at first. By “asking” I mean most often assigning readers—*Cold Calling*. We want volunteers but we want universality and accountability, as well.

Everyone has to read—and hopefully come to love reading. “The weakest readers need the *most* practice at reading, but are also the ones who tend to volunteer *least* to read aloud, as well as the ones who opt not to read privately after school hours. To serve our weakest readers, it simply must be the expectation that every child can be asked to read aloud at any time,” Jo Facer writes. Here are some details on those elements.

## Keep Durations Unpredictable

---

<!-- Page 401 -->

If you designate a student to read in class and say, “Read the next paragraph for me, Vivian,” everyone in the class knows no one else will be asked to read until Vivian finishes the paragraph. *Stating the duration for which a student will read causes other students to follow along a little less.* Instead, when you ask a student to read, don't specify how long you want her to read for. Saying, “Start reading for me please, Vivian” or “Pick up, please, Vivian” makes other students more likely to read along, since they don't know when a new reader will be asked to pick up.

In addition, keeping durations unpredictable allows you to address a struggling reader in a safe and noninvasive manner. If Vivian struggles with the paragraph you've assigned her, it means either a long, slow slog to the end, possibly exhausting for Vivian and reducing leverage with other students, or it's you suddenly cutting her short of what you promised: “OK, I'm going to stop you there, Vivian. Jelani, would you please read some?,” which carries an implicit judgment. If you don't specify the length of the read initially, however, you can adapt in the interest of both the student who's reading and the rest of the class. Vivian can read two sentences really well and then stop before she struggles too much, making the experience positive, then you can move to a dynamic reader who will push the story along for the rest of the class. Or, if Vivian is doing well, you can let her keep going. All of this happens invisibly when you avoid telling students how long they'll read.

## Keep Durations Short

Reading short segments can often allow students to invest energy in expressive reading and sustain the energy required for fluent, even dramatic reading. It's better to read really well for three or four sentences and stop than to read well for two and drone through six more. Moving quickly among primary readers can yield higher-quality

---

<!-- Page 402 -->

oral reading and make the lesson more engaging. The momentum of quick, unpredictable, and relatively frequent changes of reader makes reading feel quick and energetic rather than tedious and slow.

Knowing that segments tend to be short and may end at any time also reinforces for secondary readers that they will likely soon get a chance themselves to read, and this keeps them from tuning out.

As students develop as readers, your definition of “short” will, of course, change. Maybe the average read is two or three sentences at first, but as students get better as readers and become more able to attend carefully, as they come to love reading and lose themselves more in the text, you will naturally extend the average length of a read. Sometimes you and the class will lose yourselves in a passage, and Vivian will just keep going. The key idea is that using shorter reads can bring engagement and energy to student oral reading—perhaps at the beginning of a passage, perhaps if things slow down, perhaps all the time. When and how often is up to you.

Finally, keeping durations short enables you to take better advantage of a crucial form of data: every time you switch readers, you gather data about your leverage. When you say, “Pick up please, Charles,” and Charles jumps in with the next sentence without missing a beat, you know that Charles was reading alongside the previous reader on his own. If not, you know otherwise. Ideally, you want this sort of seamless transition every time you switch readers, and frequent switching allows you to gather and manage transitions more often and more broadly. The more data you have, the more information and tools you will have to help you ensure leverage.

# Keep the Identity of the Next Reader Unpredictable

---

<!-- Page 403 -->

If you move quickly from one primary reader to another, students focus more closely on following along. This is doubly true if they don't know who the next reader will be. A teacher who announces that she'll go around the room in a predictable fashion gives away this part of her leverage. Students can tune out until their turn is near. Retaining your ability to choose the next reader also allows you to match students to passages more effectively. If you want to use Jo Facer's idea of preselecting sentences that developing readers can be more successful with, you'll need to be able to *Cold Call* readers and you'll need to select randomly.

Unpredictability makes for both better leverage and better reading, so when you call on students to read, it's great to call on some students who volunteer—the moment when they wave their hands in the air, desperate for their chance to read is a huge win for any teacher—just make sure not to call *exclusively* on volunteers. A significant proportion, most often a majority, of readers should include those who haven't raised their hands. This will maximize leverage and normalize full and universal participation. The message should be that reading is a pleasure and that a good teacher doesn't let just a few students hog all the fun.

## Reduce Transaction Costs

A *transaction cost* is the amount of resources it takes to execute an exchange, be it economic, verbal, or otherwise. When it comes to transitioning between readers, small differences in transaction costs can have a large effect, so it's critical to reduce them. A transition from one reader to the next that takes much more than a second steals reading time and risks interrupting the continuity of what students are reading, thus affecting how well students follow and comprehend the text.

---

<!-- Page 404 -->

Make it your goal to transition from one primary reader to another quickly and with a minimum of words—ideally, in a consistent way. “Susan, pick up,” is a much more efficient transition than, “Thank you, Stephen. Nicely read. Susan will you begin reading, please?” The first transaction is more than three times as fast as the second, maximizing the amount of time students spend reading. A couple seconds of difference may seem trivial, but if you transition fifty times per class, those seconds very quickly translate into minutes and hours of lost reading time over the course of the year. Just as important, reducing your transaction cost when switching readers causes less interruption to the text, allowing students to concentrate and keep the narrative thread vibrant, alive, and unbroken. If you make a habit of minimizing transaction cost, you can more easily switch at almost any natural pause in the text, giving you even more control over when to choose a new primary reader. Can you occasionally drop in a “lovely” or a “thank you”? Of course. Though perhaps even better would be to express it with body language or a quiet and appreciative comment while a student was still reading.

Let me show you how those things look in two classrooms: Jill Murray's and Maggie Johnson's.

We'll start with Jill, whose video *Jill Murray: Quartering Act* my team loves because it is from a Social Studies class. *FASE Reading* should happen everywhere. Some aspects of reading are likely domain specific in a way we rarely consider: A nonfiction text about a historical event sounds different from a novel. A scientific text has its own unique conventions and rhythms. Students in Jill's class are developing an ear not just for reading but for historical text.

And of course we love it because of how the students react when she announces *FASE Reading* (she calls it by its then-

---

<!-- Page 405 -->

common name “Control the Game”). The kids cheer! I promise we did not pay them to do that! But it suggests the powerful sense of joy and belonging fostered by shared reading. *FASE Reading* is a pleasure, they are telling us.

Jill starts by modeling. She's saying (implicitly): *Here is what a historical text sounds like read aloud*. And just as powerfully: *Here is how I'll expect you to sound when you read aloud*. She's norm setting. Notice how she doesn't race. Commonly students will try to show their skill by reading fast. She wants them to show their skill through expression—by making meaning audible—not speed. You can hear, too, that the text is challenging! But Jill's students persist with relish. They see one another openly embracing challenge—no one's reading is perfect, but everyone is OK with that. And of course as they work toward fluency at this level of complexity, Jill is gathering critical data. She is also teaching them to sustain focus and effort when the going gets hard. All those things—the persistence, the expression—will translate into their independent reading, as well.

Now let's look at Maggie's class: In the video *Maggie Johnson: Grew Serious*, her eighth graders are reading *To Kill a Mockingbird*. It's a challenging text but look how they rise to the occasion. Maggie goes first. Her reading is a model of expressive reading. Arshe is next. He begins reading ably but Maggie encourages a bit more expression: “You can give me a little bit more than that,” she says. Call it gentle encouragement, permission to be expressive. This is important. Reading is social and we want a memorable experience with the text and for students to create as much meaning as possible through their reading. We want students to see one another doing that.

Notice the faint smile on Arshe's face as he rereads. He reads beautifully. Suddenly the story does come to life a

---

<!-- Page 406 -->

little more. Maggie laughs and gently puts a hand on his shoulder to show her appreciation.

Arshe keeps reading. It's a complex text (Lexile 870) but with encouragement he's not only thriving, he's bringing a little more expression to his reading. Another appreciative chuckle from Maggie and then it's Brianna's turn. She's perhaps a bit more halting. Again Maggie is gathering data here on how well everyone can read the text. She asks Brianna to reread a sentence to ensure correct decoding, but she does so easily and with an appreciative laugh like the one she had for Arshe's reading. Brianna gets the point: you're doing fine; keep reading. And she does. Suddenly she's cantering along and crushing it on some very challenging syntax.

Maggie steps in next. She's able to read a bit faster. There are probably kids in the room who want to move the story along. Her bridging helps keep the momentum and their attention. Notice that she's chosen an especially critical passage to read herself and notice how slow and thoughtful her model is. Then she passes the reading to Mel and then to Ronnie, who responds to her request to use expressive reading to depict an irritated Atticus.

This is the only time she's taken a volunteer—the rest of the time she's selected the reader. But here she wants real energy, top-of-the-line expressiveness, and Ronnie does a beautiful job.

It's worth noting that you are seeing effect as much as cause here. Maggie's students read this difficult text so well and with such pleasure and appreciation because they *FASE Read* so often and because the norm of expressive reading is so well established! In Maggie's classroom, expressive, joyful reading is what you do. It's also worth noting that this is an eighth-grade classroom. Sadly, few students this age get the pleasure and benefit of the kind of

---

<!-- Page 407 -->

reading Maggie's class is doing—perhaps because teachers mistakenly think it's not beneficial for older students and perhaps because some teachers think they won't like it or won't do it. I hope the pleasure Maggie's students take in their reading gives teachers license and encouragement to read aloud with older students!

Now that you've got the idea, here are a few more key elements of the technique.

## Use Bridging to Maintain Continuity

Using *FASE Reading* combines two types of reading—student oral reading and teacher oral reading. As the teacher, you are naturally the best reader in the room. In reading aloud, you model the sorts of expressive reading you want from students—joyful, scholarly, what have you. You may choose to step in yourself and read especially important or tricky passages—your reading of them can bring the nuance of the text to life and help expedite comprehension. You can also use segments to resuscitate momentum after a particularly slow or struggling reader by stepping in for a few sentences, keeping the thread of the narrative alive and engaging for other students.

In bridging, a teacher takes a turn in the *FASE Reading* rotation, reading a short segment of text—a bridge—between student readers. In a typical sequence of bridging, a teacher might ask Trayvon to read for a few sentences, then Martina and then Hilary, and then read for a stretch herself. She might have planned in advance a part she thought she should read, or she might read to model expressive reading and bring the story to life a bit. She might read because Hilary really struggled, and the teacher didn't want the slow pace to cause other readers to disengage. She might step in more or less frequently.

---

<!-- Page 408 -->

Sometimes teachers will start the reading themselves to set the tone, occasionally even doing so transparently: “I’ll start reading, then I’ll ask some of you to pick up. Be ready!” Obviously, teacher reading needn’t always bridge. When you do so is obviously discretionary, and part of the art of reading well. Harder texts often demand more bridging—to create more opportunities to model, and to balance the necessarily high rate of slower student readers.

## Spot-Check, a.k.a. Oral Cloze

I learned Oral Cloze from watching Roberto de Leòn teach reading to third-grade boys at Excellence Charter School for Boys in Bedford-Stuyvesant. In one example, Roberto kicked off his reading of *Phantom of the Opera* by leaving a word out at the end of his first sentence: “Carlotta had the …,” he read, signaling to students with his shift in tone of voice that they should fill in the blank. On the day in question, only a handful of his boys chimed in “leading role” exactly on cue. So Rob started over: “Ooh, some boys weren’t quite with us. Let’s try that again. ‘Carlotta had the …,’ ” and all his boys chimed in with “leading role,” demonstrating that they were now following along. This quick device, which Roberto uses throughout his lessons, allows him to assess leverage quickly and simply.

## Use a Placeholder

As you move between reading and questioning students about what they read, it can be helpful to use quick, consistent prompts to ensure that students recognize the transition and react quickly. I call this prompt a *placeholder*, because it ensures that students retain their place in the text and enables a quick and immediate transition back to reading after discussion. “Hold your place. Track me,” announces Patrick Pastore, modeling for his sixth graders how to point to the spot where they left

---

<!-- Page 409 -->

off reading *Esperanza Rising*, close their books partway, and engage his eyes to show they are ready to discuss. After a brief discussion of why Esperanza and Miguel react differently to a train ride, he instructs, “Pick up reading, please, Melanie.” In less than two seconds, she and her classmates are back into the book at almost no transaction cost.

Similarly, Roberto de León might intone, “Finger in your book; close your book,” as he prepares his students to discuss *Phantom of the Opera*—and also prepares them to end that discussion and return to the book efficiently.

In the video *Jessica Bracey: Circle of Gold*, you can see Jessica, then at North Star Academy in Newark, New Jersey, executing a lesson with an effective segment of *FASE Reading* embedded in it.

You'll notice how engaged Jessica's students are as she keeps durations short and unpredictable, moving the reading around the room to involve lots of students. You'll also notice that even though she calls on a number of students to read, every single one picks up on cue—solid evidence that they're all reading along with her. But then again the best evidence of all comes after about a minute and a half. Jessica mixes in an opportunity for volunteers. “Please continue for me ...” she begins, and hands shoot into the air. Students love reading when it comes to life this way; their hands show how much they feel a sense of belonging. They want to be a part of the experience.

---

<!-- Page 410 -->

Wondrous words

Please continue for me.

RELAY/GSE

You'll also notice a wide range of reading skills. There are outstanding readers who model expressive, engaged reading, and there are also some who struggle. Even so, those who struggle aren't afraid to read, even when it's tricky for them. There's a constantly supportive culture. And Jessica reacts to the stream of data that students reading aloud provide her to help them. She asks them to embed meaning into their expression or to reread words they didn't get the first time. Finally, you'll notice that the girl who reads first in the video also reads again later. Not only is it the ultimate in unpredictable reader selection—just because you've read once doesn't mean the game is over in Jessica's class—but this is a girl who's still developing her fluency skills. She gets double practice! And she's happy to read.

---

<!-- Page 411 -->

This is no small thing. These students are fifth graders. The various stages in their development as readers are passing quickly. Compare lots and lots of joyful practice for a developing reader to the alternative: the encroaching feeling for such a reader that reading is a source of embarrassment, something she will never be good at, something he wants to avoid. This can be, and is, a self-fulfilling prophecy for thousands of students.

A final note. Earlier I noted that one of the things I liked about the name *FASE Reading* is that a phase is a stage in a series of events. *FASE Reading* ideally is combined with and embedded in other classroom activities, such as five minutes of *FASE Reading* to bring the text to life and then a bout of writing about a text that seems vivid. Or ten minutes of silent reading with the text voice and setting brought to life. Or a discussion of the book we all just read. Imagine how much richer the discussion of *To Kill a Mockingbird* will be in Maggie's class after her students have heard the story come to life through Maggie's and Arshe's and Ronnie's readings. There's a lot more depth to respond to. Imagine also how much more likely they will be to pick up the book and read it that night for homework when it made them laugh together as a group that afternoon in school.

# TECHNIQUE 25: CIRCULATE

Where you stand as you work is a critical aspect of your teaching. It shapes the information you gather about students and helps determine the types of interactions you can use to guide and support them.

Can you stand naturally at a student's shoulder as she solves a problem correctly for the first time, quietly encouraging her and preserving her privacy: “Yes, that's it,” or “Much better,” or “Now you've got it!”?

---

<!-- Page 412 -->

Can you subtly move to a spot near another student as you explain the homework, and therefore provide just enough gentle accountability to keep him on task and writing down the assignment?

Only, perhaps, if you can work the room simply and easily—if you can get anywhere in your room at any time without navigating a pile of backpacks or asking for the pushing in of chairs. In fact, if you have to ask for permission to get to any spot in the classroom or if it seems unnatural for you to stand anywhere, it’s not really your room and, more importantly, you may not be able to shape it optimally to support student learning.

*Circulate* describes rules and habits for a teacher's strategic and intentional movement around the room during all parts of a lesson.

## Step 1: Break the Plane

The “plane” of your classroom is the imaginary line that runs the length of the room, parallel to and about five feet in front of the board, usually about where the first student desks start.

Some teachers are slow or perhaps hesitant to “break the plane”—to move past this imaginary barrier and out among the desks and rows. They might spend the entire lesson moving back and forth from one front corner to the other. Or just leaning on their desk in front of the board. But breaking the plane adds energy to your teaching and allows you to observe what students are doing. You can linger beside a student's desk and subtly raise your eyebrows as you ask an intriguing question or place a warm and gentle hand on his shoulder as you progress around the room.

It’s important to break the plane early—within the first few minutes of the lesson, if possible. (One benefit of technique

---

<!-- Page 413 -->

[20](), *Do Now*, is that it creates a natural opportunity to circulate and observe what students are doing right away at the outset of class.) You want it to be clear to students that it is normal for you to go anywhere in the classroom at any time, and the longer you wait to break the plane, the less natural and normal it seems for you to come wandering by at any moment.

Being able to naturally and easily get near students increases the range of tools you have in interacting with them. [Technique 9, Active Observation](), for example, is dedicated to the critical role that systematic data-gathering via circulation plays in checking for understanding. The tools it discusses require breaking the plane as a matter of course.

So, too, do a series of more mundane interactions. You can be far more private with Alfred, for example. All class long it seems like he's been fussing with something on the floor, leaning under his desk and moving his chair back and forth in order to ... well, you're not really sure. But he hasn't got anything in his notes or completed any problems. And now he's distracting the students around him. If you're only positioned at the front of the room, you're limited to a question that is likely to distract (and possibly yield a more distracting answer), such as “Alfred, what are you doing?” or “Alfred, please sit correctly in your chair.”

But wandering over to investigate as you call on a student on the other side of the room, you notice that someone has spilled something sticky on the floor beneath Alfred’s desk. It’s getting on his shoes and he’s struggling to stay focused. “Alfred, honey, move to this desk,” you can now say in a low voice. Or perhaps you can bring Alfred a few pieces of paper towel a moment later as the class discussion continues and say, “Try this, sweetheart. Wipe it up and then I’ll be back to make sure you’ve started problem

---

<!-- Page 414 -->

number 1.” Or perhaps there is no sticky something on the floor, and Alfred just needs a reminder to stay on task. Now that you're near him you can do it with a whisper. He'll appreciate that. And just maybe he will be more likely to get going.

A *whisper solution*, a *hand-you-what-you-need-while-I'm-still-teaching solution*, a *stand by you to help you complete the task or understand what the problem is solution*. These are only possible if you can get anywhere in the classroom and get there naturally, without attracting undue attention from the rest of the class: Look! She's moving toward Alfred! Your approach to Alfred is much better if he appears to be on your natural path of circulation around the room—your route. In other words, your interaction with Alfred can't be the first time in the class period you've broken the plane.

Breaking the plane, in other words, allows you to gather information constantly—even when you don't know you need to gather information; if you circulate more you will see more of what's happening in the classroom, especially from your students' perspective—and to use privacy and proximity to solve problems and communicate with individual students.

But it only works as a norm, a teacher habit. If you move out into the classroom to establish proximity only when you need to (for example, to address a behavioral situation), it will heighten attention to your actions, making it almost impossible to interact with the subtlety and finesse you sometimes need.

**Full Access Required**

Once you break the plane, you must have full access to the entire room. You must be able to simply and naturally stand next to any student in your room at any time, without

---

<!-- Page 415 -->

interrupting your teaching, listening, or observing. When you do this, you can create a climate of loving accountability.

Loving accountability means, for example, that when students are writing short responses they can predict that at some point you will glance encouragingly over their shoulder—but also that you will see whether they are doing their best work. Loving accountability means students not taking out their smartphones, in part because you have asked but in part because there is a plausible chance they'd look up from a secretive glance at their messages to find you standing there.

If moving between any two points requires the shuffling and dragging aside of backpacks or the moving of multiple chairs, you have already ceded ownership of the room. If you have to say “excuse me” to get around chairs and backpacks and desks to reach the back corner, you are asking for student permission—or interrupting their work—to stand in that space. This means there will be places safely insulated from loving accountability.

Ensure your full access in the room by keeping passageways wide and clear. Find a place for backpacks that does not impede your movement, for example, and consider seating your students in pairs rather than long arcs or rows so that you can stand directly next to anyone at any time.

**Engage When You Circulate**

It’s good to be proximate and present everywhere in the room, but it’s better if you work the room a bit. If you're actively teaching, make frequent verbal and nonverbal interventions (a smile; a hand subtly on a shoulder; “Check your spelling” to a student as you gaze at her notes). If

---

<!-- Page 416 -->

students are completing independent work, glance thoughtfully at what they're doing.

In those cases it can be useful to try to mix and match these types of interactions as you Circulate:

*Simple walk-by.* You walk by a student's desk slowly enough to show that you are monitoring what she's doing but without engaging more extensively.

*Tap/nonverbal.* You have a brief, unspoken interaction, perhaps just adjusting a student's paper by a fraction of an inch to show you are observing his work, say, or perhaps using a quick nonverbal—a thumbs-up for good progress, a traveling gesture for “C'mon, keep going.”

*Basic read/review.* You stop and make a point of reading or reviewing what a student is working on while it is on their desk. You might comment on what a student has written, but you don't necessarily have to. Reading a student's work, alone, is a powerful message.

*Pick-up read.* You stop and pick up a student's paper and read what she is working on, intimating an even greater level of interest in or scrutiny of her work. They will be watching you now so your facial expression is critical. Generally, I think, benign interest is best. *I am reading this because I care about your ideas.* Manage your tell (see [technique 12](#), *Culture of Error*) and don't give too much away until you decide to give feedback. If you can't think of anything to say, try: “Keep going.”

These last two options are especially important. Reading, assessing, and responding to student work in “real time” are indispensable to checking for understanding, showing your interest in students' work, and setting a tone of accountability—all functions that are critical to your ability to provide academic support and rigor (“Try that one again,

<!-- Page 417 -->

Charles”; “Just right, Jamel”; “You haven't shown me the third step”).

---

<!-- Page 418 -->

**Dot Round**

Recently, a colleague from the Netherlands, Carla van Doornen, shared an idea for giving feedback while circulating that I thought was fascinating: a “dot round.”

The idea is simple: you assign students independent work, and as they are working, you *Circulate* to observe. If their work contains an error, you put a dot on their paper. It is very subtle, and it's not a permanent “wrong” mark—just a reminder that there's something that needs checking. The best part is that that's *all* you do. No verbal commentary. No directions to “check again.” The idea is that the dot reminds students, subtly, to find their own mistake and, in time, encourages self-reflection and self-correction. You could then even ask students to discuss—Who got a dot and found their mistakes?

Later Rue Ratray, then of Edward Brooke Charter School in East Boston, took the idea of Dot Round and moved it a step further. Instead of using one general dot to indicate a wrong answer, Rue used three colors—green, yellow, and red—to indicate different degrees of accuracy. After *Circulating* for ten minutes or so and marking thesis statements, he would then ask several “green” students to read their work followed by several “yellow” students. This allowed students to discern subtle differences between work that was complete and work that was “almost there.” For the students receiving red dots especially (who now knew they weren't on the right track), it was helpful for them to hear models of successful answers. This adaptation “made a huge difference in their writing right away,” Rue reported, perhaps because it draws on Dylan Wiliam's observation about the benefits of models compared to rubrics and

other abstract descriptors (see [technique 21](#), *Take the Steps*) and the “Law of Comparative Judgment” to more accurately and quickly differentiate key aspects of work quality.^28

## Move Systematically

As you move around the room, your goal is to be systematic —to cover all parts of the room and be aware of what’s happening everywhere, and to show that your movements and any interactions when you *Circulate* are universal. You are likely to engage anyone at any time by checking his work, nodding at him, or sharing a smile.

In the video *Denarius Frazier: Remainder*, which figures prominently in [Chapter 3](#), you may recall how systematically Denarius moved around the room to give every student feedback and even designed his room so that his typical route of observation revealed more data.

Recently my team and I noticed how some top teachers tended to “walk the circuit” when approaching students they needed to correct. Let’s say in this case it’s Alphonse, who’s off task and distracting the student next to him. If you march too directly toward Alphonse, you intimate that you are anxious and tense. This is counterproductive in the long term. Moving too directly can also cause other students to watch your interaction with Alphonse. Taking a bit of a circuitous route to Alphonse can make your interaction more private and just might buy you a few seconds to choose your words carefully before you arrive.

Systematic is not the same as predictable, though. It’s often beneficial to avoid using the same pattern every time (left to right; clockwise around the room). Vary your pattern, skip interacting with some students, and invest heavily in time spent with others unpredictably as you *Circulate*.

# Position for Perception

As you *Circulate*, your goal should be to remain facing as much of the class as possible. That way, you can see what's going on around you at a glance and with minimal transaction cost. You can lift your eyes quickly from a student's paper and then return to reading in a fraction of a second. Turning your back, by contrast, creates a blind spot and may even invite opportunistic behavior.

A bit like the Earth itself, it helps to turn on two axes at the same time: revolving (moving around the room) and rotating (turning to face the “center of gravity”).

## Rotate and Revolve

This may require you to consider what side of students you stand on as you *Circulate*, or to reorient yourself as you take a student's paper off his desk and read. Second, a bit of mystery can help. It's often beneficial to stand where you can see students but they cannot see exactly what you are doing, standing just over a student's shoulder as you

peruse his work, for example, or standing at the back of the classroom as a class discusses a topic.

In addition to Denarius Frazier's exemplary circulation in *Denarius Frazier: Remainder*, several of the Keystone videos in the book are excellent examples of circulation at its best. I particularly recommend watching *Christine Torres: Keystone*; *Gabby Woolf: Keystone*; *Narlene Pacheco: Keystone*; and *Nicole Warren: Keystone*. Notice how they move easily around the class as they teach naturally. Even when classroom space is tight you'll notice teachers moving around to teach from most areas of the room, going front to back, and interacting with students as they do so.

# TECHNIQUE 26: EXIT TICKET

As the bell rings at the end of class and students gather their things, we often have an intuitive sense of how our lesson went, but without objective data, it can be hard to know for sure how student understanding has changed as the result of the hour spent together. In order for our students to make maximum progress, we need better information. In order to get a reliable snapshot of student thinking, I recommend ending your lesson with a short sequence of questions that reveals the extent to which students have mastered the central content of the day (as well as, perhaps even more important, who is still struggling and with what). When you collect this from students before they leave, and review the data, it's called an *Exit Ticket*. Use of *Exit Tickets* can establish a productive habit of student review (and retrieval practice) at the end of a lesson and also ensure that you end each session with information you can use to analyze your students' progress and inform coming lessons.

After reviewing the results of an *Exit Ticket*, you hope to know: How many of your students answered a basic

---

<!-- Page 422 -->

question assessing the content correctly? How many could answer a more nuanced question? What mistake did those who got it wrong make? You can even reflect on whether your “gut” sense of how well the lesson went was correct, and why.

One caveat before sharing more specific guidance on *Exit Tickets*: one of the most common pitfalls of *Exit Tickets* is to equate performance with learning. You'll recall from the discussion of *Retrieval Practice* that once students have initially learned something, they quickly begin to forget it. As Harry Fletcher Wood puts it, “Student performance while being taught is a poor indicator of lasting learning.” *Exit Tickets* are designed to give you more immediate data on misconceptions students may be struggling with *as they are in the process of learning*, not to measure how well students have committed previously learned knowledge or skills to long-term memory. They provide you with an opportunity to intervene as close as possible to the point of misunderstanding, so students can spend their valuable time and cognitive space remembering correctly. But once you start to see mastery on *Exit Tickets* you have understanding, not learning. For that you'll need to make sure to return to concepts over time.

## Characteristics of Effective *Exit Tickets*

Here are some general characteristics of effective *Exit Tickets*:

**They're quick:** Two or three questions is a good rule of thumb. It's not a unit quiz. You want to get a good idea of how your kids did on the core part of your objective and, given how busy you are, be able to review the data in a few minutes.

**They're designed to yield data.** Think about asking each question (or part of a question) to focus on one specific part

---

<!-- Page 423 -->

of the lesson rather than asking several questions that summarize the whole lesson. That way, if students get it wrong, you'll know which part was the problem. Also remember to vary formats—one multiple choice and one open response, say. You need to know that students can answer both ways.

*They* make great Do Nows. After you have looked at the data, let your students do the same. When students struggle, start the next day's lesson by redoing questions or studying wrong answers from the *Exit Ticket*.

*They're* predictable. An effective *Exit Ticket* doesn't introduce new concepts or skills. It should reflect the work students did in the lesson. Honestly it's fine if a question in the *Exit Ticket* repeats or restates a key question from the lesson itself.

## Variation: The Stamp

*Exit Tickets* are designed to be quick and data friendly. Occasionally, though, you may wish to substitute another form of daily assessment in their stead. These are called *stamps*. The name was coined by Paul Bambrick-Santoyo, who uses it to refer to a student-initiated summary of key learning points. Sometimes a teacher will ask a student to “stamp the learning” during class ... that is to recap the important points of a discussion, say. But a stamp can also be a written activity—an open-ended *Exit Ticket* if you will. A stamp is slightly longer than *Exit Tickets* and almost always open-ended. It asks a student to summarize their takeaways. In building our Reading Reconsidered Curriculum we found we used an *Exit Ticket* on the great majority of days, but occasionally we would use a stamp instead. They took twice as long but they asked students to complete a broader, more comprehensive reflection. The data isn't quite as crisp and there's more to grade. But it

<!-- Page 424 -->

gives you the opportunity to assess more advanced and rigorous thinking.

For comparison, here are three examples of *Exit Tickets* we wrote in our curriculum units and one typical “stamp.”

## Example 1: *Romeo and Juliet*

**Exit Ticket**

1. Which of the following lines hint at the dark and **tragic** mood underlying Act 1, scene 4? Circle all that apply:  
   a. “I have a soul of lead / So stakes me to the ground …”  
   b. “I am too sore enpierced with his shaft …”  
   c. “Borrow Cupid's wings / And soar with them above a common bound.”  
   d. “My mind misgives / Some consequence yet hanging in the stars.”  
2. Select one of the circled lines, and in 2–3 sentences, explain how it develops a **tragic** mood:

## Example 2: *The Giver*

<!-- Page 425 -->

**Exit Ticket**

1. Name at least two rules that exist in the community, and list at least two things about the community that are still **ambiguous**.

| Rules | Ambiguities |
|-------|-------------|
|       |             |

2. In one carefully crafted sentence, describe the degree to which members of the community seem *apprehensive* or *obedient*. You can choose one or both words to use in your response.

**Example 3:** *Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry*

<!-- Page 426 -->

## Exit Ticket

1. Complete each of the following sentences:
   - The Logan family owns land **because**__________
   - The Logan family owns land, **but**__________
   - **Since** the Logan family owns land__________

**STAMP: LORD OF THE FLIES**

<!-- Page 427 -->

**Stamp:** This lesson is titled: “That’s how you can feel in the forest.” Who says this and what does he mean by it? Explain why that might be, using one or two details from today’s reading.

**Exit Ticket Advice from Teachers**

Because *Exit Ticket* is one of the most commonly used and deeply trusted techniques in the book, I recently asked some teachers for their advice, and the results were pretty amazing. The insights came from the United States and the United Kingdom; they came from district school teachers, charter school teachers, and private school teachers. They came from teachers whose lessons I’d watched and admired, and teachers I’d never met. Here are a few gems.

**Review Data Efficiently**

One of the key themes was reviewing the data. Teachers advised looking at the data quickly and using a standard, low-transaction-cost way of processing to make it easy to

---

<!-- Page 428 -->

take action. Leanne Riordan of Baltimore suggests looking at the *Exit Tickets* as soon as you can, right after the lesson if possible, and sorting them into three piles—Yes, Some, and No—based on the responses. After looking for reasons that students missed a concept entirely or grasped it partially, make quick notes right on the *Exit Ticket*. You can then use these piles to differentiate small groups the next day or to create a *Do Now* for the whole class if needed.

As an added tip, keep the No pile on the top as a reminder to check in with those students more frequently the next day. Alternately, tracking the number of students who get a certain score and adding notes to sum up misconceptions can help you stay accountable for grading nightly and give you a glimpse of how the lesson went.

Hand in hand with reviewing results quickly is creating a format that makes it super easy to do. For example, Janice Smith, from Durham, North Carolina, uses sticky notes, having students write their name on the front and their answer on the back. On the way out of the classroom, students stick the notes to the door, allowing Janice to quickly flip through them between classes and easily enter data in a spreadsheet later in the day. Regardless of whether you use handouts or even just have students write their answers on something as simple as a sticky note, ensuring consistent placement (a variety of *Standardize the Format*) makes reviewing answers far more efficient.

## Have a Clear Purpose

Another common theme surrounds the purpose of *Exit Tickets*. One teacher in the United Kingdom talked about the importance of having a “clear sense of why you are using *Exit Tickets*.” If *Exit Tickets* show poor understanding across the class, then reteach; if *Exit Tickets* show just a few students to be struggling, then that small

<!-- Page 429 -->

group may need a separate intervention; if the class kind of gets it, but is a bit unsure, then focus on areas of uncertainty for homework or during regular ten-minute slots for a few weeks; if *Exit Tickets* reveal the class to be very secure about a certain topic, then schedule a refresher in a week or two, but don't give this topic too much time, as there will be better things to use it for. In short, responding to *Exit Tickets* is often about being entrepreneurial with time.

Alexa Miller, a fourth-grade teacher in New York, addressed that theme as well, saying that she leaves *Exit Tickets* in student mailboxes to be corrected the next morning. This works well for elementary teachers, because students can fix mistakes during breakfast while the teacher Circulates to assist and recheck. This extra step in the screening process for remediation helps keep groups small.

There was a great piece of planning advice from a champion teacher whose lessons I'd watched multiple times. Heather Snodgrass of Nashville advised: “[I] write the *Exit Ticket* first, before planning out any other parts of the lesson. This helps me focus in on the key points that are essential to conveying the most important content, and occasionally helps me refine the objective so I'm honing in on a manageable and appropriately rigorous skill.” She added, “I also like having a consistent routine for students who frequently finish their *Exit Tickets* very quickly. One I've used for math is having students write their own problems about the skill we've learned that day. Students also like this if they get an opportunity to solve each other's problems.”

**Notes**

1. TLAC purists will notice the change in name of this technique from *Name the Steps* to *Take the Steps*. The core idea is breaking complex tasks up into discrete steps and teaching and practicing them. I've de-emphasized the naming part. The naming can be useful but it can also lead to an excessive focus on a resulting acronym—that is, you fall in love with your acronym and then don't retire it when students are ready.

2. Birch and Bloom coined this term in a 2007 paper *“The curse of knowledge in reasoning about false beliefs.”* I am partial to Greg Ashman's treatment of it in *The Power of Explicit Teaching and Direct Instruction*.

3. In a study of how physicists studied complex problems, Chi, Glaser, and Feltovich found that experts see deep principles when novices see superficial features.

4. On January 30, 2021. Thank you to the lovely and insightful people who shared their thoughts. It's reassuring to know there remain corners of sanity, goodness, and community on social media.

5. I used this term in *TLAC 1.0* to refer to engaging exercises to win students' interest at the outset of a lesson or unit.

6. The addition of excess and extraneous details, notes the ghost of Hemingway, does not make an essay better.

7. *Show Call* (technique 13) is an ideal tool for this.

information. If this topic is of interest to you, Oliver Caviglioli's *Dual Coding* is an excellent starting point.

10. Pam A. Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer conducted three separate studies to compare longhand note takers to those who took notes on laptops (“The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard: Advantages of Longhand Over Laptop Note Taking,” *Psychological Science* 25, no. 6 [2014]). “In three studies,” the authors wrote, “we found that students who took notes on laptops performed worse on conceptual questions than students who took notes longhand. We show that whereas taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takers' tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.” In a 2014 discussion of Mueller and Oppenheimer's research in *Scientific American*, Cindi May notes, “Because longhand notes contain students' own words and handwriting, they may serve as more effective memory cues by recreating the context (e.g. thought processes, emotions, conclusions) as well as content (e.g. individual facts) from the original learning session.” Some researchers suggest that typewritten notes offer other advantages (e.g. they may be preferable because they can be more easily edited). This may be true, but it is also true that having a laptop out during class causes students to multitask and distract themselves. Daisy Christodoulou's *Teachers vs Tech?* summarizes much of the research in this area. She cites Carter, Greenberg, and Walker's 2016 study in which students who did not bring devices to a course did better than those who did and Glass and Kang's 2018 study in which students were randomly split into two lecture groups, one with devices and one without, with the result being that students without devices did better. One possible reason might be the benefits of longhand

note taking. Another might be the reduction of attentional focus caused by the presence of a screened device.

11. I took my own advice here. When my son left for college, I gave him two pieces of academic advice: (1) Never miss class, and (2) put your laptop away during class and handwrite your notes, then retype the notes afterward to review.

13. Her book should be required reading for every teacher. You can read my review of it here: https://www.educationnext.org/forgetting-how-to-read-review-reader-come-home-maryanne-wolf/.

14. Rates of reading dropped especially steeply over the years when students typically get a smartphone, from 76 percent at age 8 to 40 percent at age 14. https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED607777.pdf.

15. Perhaps as a result the 2005 ACT revealed that “only about half of our nation's ACT-tested students are ready for college-level reading.”

17. *The Grapes of Wrath* provides a fortuitous example—it alternates between chapters written in straightforward prose and chapters written in a variety of experimental styles that merge prose and poetry. Can students read

the novel independently? It depends on which chapter you assign.

18. It's also worth noting that beginning with shared reading can act as an effective transition into independent reading—it's much easier to continue reading something you've started together, rather than to jump in cold.

19. Control the Game—which you are welcome to keep using if you prefer—originally came from the game of soccer. Certain central midfielders have the job of controlling the game, not by hogging the ball themselves but by being a brief and often nearly invisible pivot point: the ball comes to them and they pass it somewhere else. They coordinate the attack and set the rhythm, determining when others get opportunities and setting them up to succeed. Such players rarely score the goals. Their job is to organize and arrange the team, to get the ball to others so they can score. This process—ball comes in briefly, they pass it on to someone new, ball comes back, and they quickly move it on again in a different direction—reminded me of what a teacher does when steering reading opportunities around the room. Truly, it was an obscure and quirky reference at best. But there were a lot of techniques to name and you can't get them all right. At least it wasn't an acronym.

23. Maryanne Wolf's book *Reader, Come Home* is an outstanding study of the ways constant exposure to technology is changing the portions of the brain that we use when we read. These portions of the brain are neuroplastic—they change in response to what they are asked to do. I strongly recommend the book. I also wrote a book review of it that makes the broader case that I don't have time for here as to why Wolf's book is so deeply important.

24. And, sadly, even within the walls of many schools.

25. Especially for independent reading.

26. In some cases the challenges of student oral reading have come to dominate the conversation, to the point that teachers are routinely advised to “never ask students to read aloud.” It’s often dismissively referred to by the pejorative phrase “popcorn reading,” but creating a simplistic straw man is not grounds for dismissing a crucial classroom practice. There are surely challenges to student oral reading, but they are also

easily managed and overcome by a capable classroom teacher.

27. See Oliver Caviglioli, *Dual Coding*.

28. I discuss the Law of Comparative Judgments in [technique 13](#), *Show Call*. As I noted there, it was derived in the 1920s by psychologist Louis Thurstone and demonstrates that people make better judgments about quality and learn more from analysis when asked to compare two examples of something than they do when trying to judge the quality of one example of something.
