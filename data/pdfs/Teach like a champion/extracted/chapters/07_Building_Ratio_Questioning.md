## Building Ratio Through Questioning

> Here's how you should think about memory: it's the residue of thought, meaning that the more you think about something, the more likely it is that you'll remember it later.
>
> —Daniel Willingham^[1]

The term “ratio” refers to the proportion of cognitive work done by students during a lesson. This is an important thing for teachers to reflect on. Students remember what they think about, Daniel Willingham tells us. So a major goal of our teaching is to cause students—all of them, ideally—to do quite a lot of thinking about the most important content of the lesson. But of course there's a bit more to it than that. “Desirable difficulty” is what cognitive psychologists call the idea that thinking harder about something encodes it more deeply in memory and therefore makes it easier to remember—and probably encodes more things of substance in the first place, as well.

We could represent the concept of ratio graphically like this:

# The Ratio Spectrum

**Think Ratio:**  
What are students thinking about?  
What’s the rigor of the content? Is there Desirable Difficulty?

**Participation Ratio:** How many students are thinking, how much of the time?

Understanding this diagram requires defining two terms for describing student thinking during the lesson. The first is Participation Ratio (PR). I've put this on the x axis. It asks the question of who participates and how often. If I ask a question and everyone in my classroom answers in their heads or picks up their pencil and starts writing out thoughts, my Participation Ratio is high. Everyone in the class is answering my question. If it's a discussion and everyone is listening carefully to the speaker my Participation Ratio is high. Potentially it's higher still if I occasionally divide my whole group discussion up into pair discussions (Turn and Talks); suddenly more people are participating. My PR is high.

If I was measuring my Participation Ratio, though, I'd have to measure it over the course of the whole lesson. A minute

or two of full participation isn't nearly as good as everyone engaged and participating all class long.

One easy way to get a high Participation Ratio might be to do a lot of *Call and Response*. Students love it—at least younger ones—and I can see that everyone is answering my questions. *If I add six and six what do I get ... class?!*

The problem of course is that while adding six and six is helpful to a degree, there's not much “desirable difficulty.” My questioning isn't going to be rigorous enough to ensure deep understanding of the math. To do that I've got to ask harder questions about harder things. Students have to strain a little. The rigor of student thinking I could call Think Ratio (TR) and put it on my y axis.2

I could boost my Think Ratio even more if my students thought deeply about substantive questions *in a variety of ways*. Writing, for example, is especially rigorous. Writing and then listening to how others thought about the same question might be even more challenging, with unexpected ideas suggested by others to wrestle with and reconcile with my own thoughts. At least that would happen if I were a good listener. If I had to rewrite my initial idea based on what I'd heard in the discussion and then explain my changes to a partner, my thinking could have even greater depth and variety.

If that happened and it happened steadily throughout class, I might plot my class overall at point 1 on the Ratio Spectrum above. My Think Ratio would be high throughout and so would my Participation Ratio.

This would be better than my *Call and Response* lesson with math facts, which would land around point 3: high Participation Ratio but low Think Ratio.

If I instead dusted off my deepest questions about the nature of math and had a profound discussion about it with

---

<!-- Page 482 -->

the two or three most engaged students in class, I might check in at point 4, high Think Ratio, low Participation Ratio.

Sadly it would be easier than I might think to get down to point 2: low PR, low TR. I could get there via a banal lesson plan yielding boring questions and bored students. But just as likely I could get there with a promising lesson and lack of attention to teaching technique. For example, if I allowed students to call out answers to questions, and the two or three most verbal students in my class proceeded to call out the first answer they could think of to each question, I would very quickly get to point 2. Even my two or three answerers weren’t thinking very hard and everyone else would have long since realized they weren’t answering and would be elsewhere, mentally. In that case I could be asking the most brilliant questions in the world. Two or three people answering them with half thought-out ideas is enough to render my perfect questions irrelevant.

The following three chapters are about increasing student understanding and knowledge—not to mention motivation and engagement—by taking three paths to point 1.

In [Chapter Seven]() we'll address how questioning skills can increase PR and TR. For example, if I can use *Means of Participation* to signal to my three highly verbal students that I’d like them to raise their hands unless otherwise indicated, I can suddenly slow things down and cause them to think more deeply about my questions. “Perhaps your first answer is not the best …” I say, and they stop to reconsider. Over time I teach them to think slowly and deeply. If I then begin *Cold Calling*, I can cause more students to share answers (even those who don’t at first volunteer readily) and even more students than that to answer in their heads in preparation of the fact that they

---

<!-- Page 483 -->

might just get called on. Suddenly we are moving up and to the right on the graph.

In [Chapter Eight](), we'll address how writing can boost the ratio. If I pose my question and ask everyone to write out some initial thoughts, I suddenly have thirty students answering a question I might previously have had just one or two students answer. I have multiplied my PR but also my TR. Students have to choose precise coordinated syntax and verbiage to write out an idea, especially if, again, I can get them to work more slowly and deliberately at times. Or to rewrite for precision, even. Writing is inherently harder than talking. Again we are suddenly sailing upward and rightward.

In [Chapter Nine]() we'll address discussion and how it can help boost ratio. There's a bit of a golden ticket in this chapter, a hidden gem that not everyone recognizes the value of. It's the realization that the ratio during a discussion—and indeed the quality of the discussion more broadly—is shaped at least as much, or even more, by the degree and quality of listening as it is by the degree and quality of talking. We live in a world where sometimes we're all talking (or shouting), and no one is listening (unless shouting back counts). Our classrooms are better if they are the antidote to such a world. So perhaps a better title for [Chapter Nine]() is Ratio Through Discussion and Listening.

Before we get to these topics, there's one additional factor to consider: the knowledge prerequisite. To quote Daniel Willingham once more:

---

<!-- Page 484 -->

Data from the last thirty years lead to a conclusion that is not scientifically challengeable. Thinking well requires knowing facts, and that's true not simply because you need something to think about. The very processes that teachers care about most—critical thinking processes such as reasoning and problem-solving—are intimately intertwined with factual knowledge that is in long-term memory (not just found in the environment).

The tools in the ratio toolbox are wonderful, but they work only if they are employed in knowledge-rich (and knowledge-enriched) settings. That is: where students know a lot about the topics you ask them to think about because you've taught them. If you want a high Think Ratio you must have facts. Yes, “mere facts.” (I'm pausing here while a pall descends over some of my readership.) Students must have facts to use, apply, consider, connect, and reflect on. Of course, the facts are even better if they're connected in a deep and organized body of knowledge, the fancy name for which is schema.³ In a knowledge-rich environment, though, even “disconnected facts,” that straw man of futurist educators the world over, don't stay disconnected for long.⁴ Soon enough, students will see connections among the things they know and their facts will no longer be disconnected—doubly so if we place them in situations that make it more likely for them to connect the pieces of knowledge they hold.

I share this because the power of knowledge is one of the most misunderstood things in education. You've heard those self-same futurists and their acolytes in TED Talks and out on social media telling us that facts are irrelevant because you can look anything up on Google, but this is not, in fact, true. To use knowledge in critical thinking it has to be in your long-term memory. What we call insight or even creativity is often actually a bit of knowledge from

---

<!-- Page 485 -->

long-term memory popping up in the moment we learn about something else and announcing a previously not-obvious connection.⁵ But even beyond that, the “just Google it” theory doesn’t work because you’re unlikely to know there’s a connection between something you don’t know about and what you’re reading or learning about, so you’re unlikely to think to look it up.⁶ And even if you did, you’d have to hold it in your short-term memory once you looked it up, and this would leave you less working memory for creative leaps.

Bloom’s Taxonomy, at least when presented as a pyramid, is a typical point of confusion. Educators often presume that knowledge and facts being at the bottom of the pyramid means they’re the least important part. Many followers of Bloom on the other hand insist that he understood the profound importance of knowledge and meant to imply that the whole thing rested on a foundation of knowledge because it was so important. That’s relieving to hear but doesn’t change the fact that many (most?) educators don’t think about it that way. If you’ve got a pyramid, every teacher glances at it and wants to guide his or her students to the top: *We’re all in synthesis, all the time in this classroom.* Sadly, cognitive science tells us that this is wrong. It’s actually the lowly facts that work like fuel and get the whole cognitive motor humming.

## Building Ratio Through Questioning

Teachers love to ask questions. Rightly. Questions can cause students to think deeply about content, and what students think about is what they are likely to learn and remember.⁷ And of course questions can spark discussion and peer-to-peer learning.

But *can* and *do* are different things. We have all been inspired by profound questions but we have all also seen,

---

<!-- Page 486 -->

and many of us (myself included) have taught lessons where questions, once asked, hang unanswered in the air. Or generate a smattering of half-hearted and obligatory responses: the same few students (or student) calling out the first thought off the top of their heads.

Just because we ask questions doesn’t mean students answer them, in other words—or think much about them. So it’s worth using a few tools to refine questioning and ensure that it supports strong Participation and Think Ratios. As a starting point, let's differentiate two different reactions that students may have to questions, both of which can be valuable in the classroom.

First, there is thinking. Ideally everyone in a given class would think rigorously about every question you ask and attempt to answer it *in their minds*. This is a different activity from answering the question and sharing their thinking *aloud*. Answering and thinking are separate variables.

---

<!-- Page 487 -->

Degree to which students think about answers internally

Degree to which students answer aloud

Zone of desired student behaviors: Answering almost every question in their heads; answering frequently aloud

That might seem like an arcane point to make, but to be the teachers our students deserve, we need to reliably cause both to occur. Imagine you're the teacher and I am your student. When you ask a question, I think deeply about my response and also share slivers of my insights with the group. All my classmates do the same. That's the ideal, but it doesn't come about easily. I might barely think about a question and reflexively answer off the top of my head. I'd be answering, but you would have failed to elicit much thinking. Or I could think deeply but never share those private thoughts, leaving you and all my classmates to guess to what degree I was engaged in and learning about the class content. Then you'd have thinking but not answering. And of course, I could neither think about nor

---

<!-- Page 488 -->

answer the question. I could sit and engage in flights of my own fancy while class went on around me.

In fact, the degree of thinking I do and the degree of my intent to answer are correlated; *norms of answering shape norms of thinking*. I am less likely to think fully about your questions if I know I am unlikely to share my thinking with others. On the other hand, if answering fully and well is the social norm in the classroom—that is, most of my classmates answer frequently and with full effort, so I think that's the natural thing to do—I am more likely to persist in doing the hard work of thinking because I want to be able to answer too.

Perhaps a few students will persist in the most rigorous inquiry when left to their own accord and self-discipline but most (myself included!⁸) require the possibility of having to share their answer to sustain and encourage their best thinking. So unless we manage the process of who answers, when and how, we are far less likely to cause the greatest amount of thinking to occur among the widest range of students.

I am aware that I have not said anything about the content of questions yet and that may concern some readers. Needless to say, the quality of your question matters deeply. Among other benefits, a good question creates a strong incentive (or disincentive) to answer. It is also true, though, that if questions engage only a narrow group of students or only engage them half-heartedly, *the quality of the question doesn't matter much*. You can ask the most profound question in the world; if only one or two students think about it deeply with the expectation that they might answer, it's all for naught. If we want to improve questioning, it's necessary to first address the culture and context in which questions are asked.

---

<!-- Page 489 -->

Thus the techniques in this chapter include *Wait Time* (how to build “thinking habits” in the moments after a question is asked and before answers are given) and *Cold Call* (which among other things ensures that all students feel that they might be called on to answer and therefore engage fully in thinking about questions). I’ll also discuss *Call and Response*, which can help build norms of engaged participation, and *Means of Participation*, which is a reflection on the overlooked step of communicating to students how you will ask them to answer questions. Finally, I will discuss *Break It Down*, the process of using additional questions to help students when they are stuck.

## Basic Guidance for Question Writing

Of course how you craft your questions matters, so before going deeper into these techniques for building ratio through questioning, I’m going to share notes on writing better questions that focus on two things: preparation and purpose.

1. **Preparation:** It is difficult to think of a great question in the midst of teaching. You need your working memory elsewhere. Either your question or something else will likely suffer if you try to think of the perfect way to unlock the irony of Jane Austen’s prose in the moment your students are reading it. Whenever possible, plan and write your questions out in advance—either the exact ones you will ask or key questions you *might* ask. Even a first draft helps. If you change it in the midst of the lesson that’s a good thing: that a second draft improves on a first draft does not mitigate the value of the earlier draft.

2. **Purpose:** The purpose is not to ask questions; the purpose is to use questions to elicit different types of thinking. A question is a means to an end, so if your

---

<!-- Page 490 -->

goal is to use questioning in a lesson, it's necessary to take the next step: use it for what?

If the end purpose is to use thinking to elicit different types of thinking, it's worth noting that we often fall into unconscious habits—consistently asking the same types of questions—and thus elicit the same types of thinking, perhaps overlooking opportunities for different types of questions that elicit different types of thinking. Categorizing questions by the type of thinking they seek to foster is an imperfect endeavor at best, but it can help to push us outside our familiar habits and ways. With that in mind, here are five purposes for questions:

1. Discovery: Some questions are intended to cause students to *discover* or derive a new idea. I could ask you questions designed to make you realize that an author is talking about something that the *reader* knows but the *main character* doesn't. When you explain that this is happening, I tell you it's called “dramatic irony.”

2. Application: Just as rigorous—sometimes more so—is to start with the idea and ask students to apply or explain its *application*. I tell you that “dramatic irony” is when the reader knows something the main character doesn't and then ask, “Why is the author using dramatic irony here?” or “How is it different from the last time she used it?”

3. Check for understanding: There are also *check for understanding* questions, which are retrospective: “Why did we say the author was using dramatic irony? Where was the dramatic irony in yesterday's reading?”

4. Retrieval practice: We use *Retrieval Practice* questions to encode ideas in students' long-term memory. such as “Please define dramatic irony for me, Charles.”

---

<!-- Page 491 -->

5. Perception-based questions: *Perception-based* questions ask students to describe what they notice. These are crucial but underrated. Perception is the first step in understanding, and when describing what they see, students must prioritize what they think is most important. When you ask, “What do you notice about Emma’s language in this passage, Charles?” He may tell you a lot of things but also reveal that he has missed a phrase of crucial irony. Or perhaps he has seen it. Until he can observe the key phenomena for himself he is not fully autonomous.

# Using Perception-Based Questions: What Differences Do You See?

Sensitivity Analysis is a close reading tool my colleagues and I describe in Reading Reconsidered Curriculum in which the teacher presents a sentence from a text to students and asks them to compare it to a similar version they've created with one or two small changes.

The idea is for students to analyze the impact of word choice or syntax by comparing subtly different examples. The key is in the subtlety of the differences. Research in comparative judgment suggests this is an especially effective way to unlock understanding of nuance and complexity. Students perceive a slight difference in tone or mood and so develop an ear for language.

In testing out lesson plans for the Reading Reconsidered Curriculum we developed, I volunteered to teach a lesson on the novel *Esperanza Rising* that included a sensitivity analysis question, and I struggled badly.

The sentence in question described the protagonist's experience in a dust storm.

The original was:

> “Thousands of acres of tilled soil were becoming food for *la tormenta* and the sky was turning into a brown swirling fog.”

The alternative was:

> “Thousands of acres of tilled soil were blown into the air and the sky was turning into a brown swirling fog.”

---

<!-- Page 493 -->

Students jumped in gamely. The idea was to help students see the impact of personification—that it made the storm seem alive, like a monster perhaps, but students' responses were vague. “The original was more descriptive,” one student opined. “It made you feel things more,” said another. They struggled to look carefully at the differences in word choice and I struggled to help them. We were fumbling around as if in a dust storm ourselves.

Afterwards, Colleen Driggs, who’d been observing, advised: “Focus on perception first. Ask them to start by observing the differences they see between the two sentences. Then ask them to analyze.”

This was simple but brilliant. My first question should have simply been: “What differences do you see between the two sentences?” This would have caused students to describe (and see) the changes first and then think about their impacts. I needed to start by making sure they saw the difference and then ask why it mattered. Understanding almost always starts with perception … for me, as well as my students.

Colleen caused me to see the opportunity in shifting to perception-based questions. I’d been asking application and discovery questions. By helping me to see how a perception question was different, she allowed me to then think about how to use it. In part that’s why I suggest occasionally asking yourself, “What kind of question did I use there? What was its purpose? Might I have used a different type of question?”

**TECHNIQUE 32: PHRASING FUNDAMENTALS**

---

<!-- Page 494 -->

How we ask a question can help ensure that it is worth trying to answer from the perspective of the listener; the question's structure can have a significant influence on the degree of thinking and answering it inspires.  
Understanding a few “phrasing fundamentals” can help make sure your questions engage your students as you'd hope they would.

## The Obvious Trap

One reason students don't answer or think about questions is because they don't seem worth answering, often because they are either rhetorical—the teacher doesn't really expect an answer—or, worse, so obvious that they seem rhetorical. You might call this *the obvious trap*. Questions with obvious answers are killers of intellectual culture because they pretend to ask a question when there's really no question. *Why are you asking me that?* students think. If you're often asked meaningless questions, you become skeptical of the questioner. Students become reluctant to answer under those circumstances. When everyone clearly knows the answer, the person who gives that answer aloud appears to be a fool: oblivious and overeager. Sometimes we seek to start a discussion with an “easy” question, for example, but because the answer seems so obvious, participants are reluctant to answer, perhaps thinking they've missed something or that it was actually a trick question. The effect is the opposite of the intent. We kill the culture from the outset. In the long run, too. Over time, asking questions with obvious answers undercuts the credibility of your questioning more broadly.

Yes/no questions and questions with just two possible answers are especially vulnerable to *the obvious trap*. And, obvious or not, they often reduce the quality of the learning environment because one-word answers are the natural response.

---

<!-- Page 495 -->

Consider a science teacher who asks, during a lab, “Should we add our solution now or wait till it cools?”

I haven't provided enough context to indicate whether the solution should be added now but I'd wager the answer is pretty likely that we should wait. Would you stop a lesson to ask, “Should we add the solution now or wait till it cools?” if the answer was that you should add the solution now? Unlikely. You'd just say, “Now we add our solution.” Or would you ask “What should we do now?” The answer is obvious and students are likely to perceive the question as rhetorical or think, *Why are you asking us?*

One reason this may happen is because a teacher is trying to ask a question when she really just wants to explain something: “It's important to remember that we should wait for the solution to cool.” Or even: “It's important to remember that we should wait for the solution to cool. Why?” It's OK to tell people things directly. Appearing to ask a question when you want to tell students something wastes time and builds a culture where questions don't feel engaging and authentic. It's hard to build intellectual engagement from that kind of experience.

The questions “Should I add the solution now?” and “Should I add the solution now or wait till it cools?” are also uninspiring because they are binary. There are two possible answers in each case. “Yes” or “no” in the first question and “now” or “later” in the second. “What should I do now?” would be more interesting. “What should I look for now?”—a perception-based question for which the answer might be “the temperature”—would be better. Or “What's happening now?” which, assuming you can't see anything happening at the moment, might have more of a retrospective focus and allow you to check for understanding of previously taught content. These questions are all more interesting because there are more

---

<!-- Page 496 -->

than two possible answers. Simply making the question nonbinary helps.

Binary questions are also problematic because they are especially prone to “tipping,” which occurs when the questioner adds voice inflection on a word or phrase to suggest the answer. A bit of emphasis on “now” or perhaps on the “let it cool”—“Should we add the solution now? Or *let it cool*?”—makes answering doubly redundant. Your questions could be about bocce, something I know exactly nothing about, and given a binary question with a bit of voice inflection to tip me off, I'm getting ten out of ten correct answers.

## Avoid Bait and Switch

Another way questions can go wrong is because you ask a question, give students time to think about it, and then call on them to answer a different question, or a question you rephrase in a way that changes its meaning. “How is Jonas changing in this chapter? Turn and talk with your partner for ninety seconds,” you say. But after the *Turn and Talk* you say, “Great. Where and how do we see Jonas's anxiety showing up?” The eager student who put her hand up thinking she'd be asked the original question is caught out. She showed her enthusiasm and now may quite publicly struggle to answer. It's bait and switch and it makes it less likely that she'll keep raising her hand as confidently or as often.

Most of the time, bait and switch happens because we haven't prepared. If you think up your question in the moment, you will have to keep it in your working memory while you listen to student responses, manage the classroom, think about the content, and so on. Under these conditions it's easy to forget your own question—or to remember only the general idea. It's one more reason to

---

<!-- Page 497 -->

plan (and write down) your key questions in advance.⁹ If you do use questions that are thought up in the moment, write them on the board when you can. The visual will help students remain disciplined to answer what you asked, and it will also help you to remember the original question.

## TECHNIQUE 33: WAIT TIME

After asking a question of his class, the typical teacher waits about a second before taking an answer. The challenges and limitations posed by such a habit are significant. The answers the teacher can expect to get after less than a second's reflection are unlikely to be the richest, the most reflective, or the most developed his students can generate. And taking answers after just a second has the effect of systematically encouraging students to raise their hands with the first answer they think of, rather than the best answer. If students wait any longer, someone else will have answered. What's more, taking immediate answers makes it more likely that the teacher will waste time. He will likely have to respond to a poorer answer before he gets a good one. A bit of waiting can often save you time in the end, as it ensures that you start with higher-quality initial answers.

Wait Time is the practice of inserting a short amount of waiting—often just a fraction of a second—before taking an answer. Under ideal circumstances, what happens during Wait Time is thinking, so it's a powerful tool for increasing Think Ratio.

The benefits of waiting a few seconds between question and answer include:

- Allowing more hands to go up
- Enabling a wider range of scholars to raise their hands

---

<!-- Page 498 -->

- Supporting better, more rigorous answers
- Prompting more cognitive work during the “wait”
- Increasing use of evidence in answers

You can see a great example of *Wait Time* in the video *Maggie Johnson: Focus on Why* from an eighth-grade English class at Troy Prep Middle School. The class is discussing *To Kill a Mockingbird*, and the clip begins as Maggie follows up on some writing she’s asked her students to do. “As I walked around, [I noticed] many of you were able to tell me what the difference in opinion is between Aunt Alexandra and Atticus on Calpurnia,” Maggie says. “The question is, why?”

After about a second (the amount of time a typical teacher waits), there’s just one hand in the air. So Maggie waits. After three seconds or so, perhaps eight more students have raised their hands. Just a second or two of additional reflection time, and a spate of students enthusiastically offer to participate, having realized they have some insight on the matter. Her smile and the playful way she raises her eyebrows diffuses any awkwardness. In another few seconds a few more hands go up, these a bit more tentative. This is especially interesting: the last group of students who’ve raised their hands seem as though they weren’t at first sure they wanted to risk it, but have decided to after all. In many ways, these are exactly the kids you want raising their hands, and it’s exciting to see the courage that a few seconds will evoke.

In the end, Maggie gives, by my count, eight seconds of *Wait Time* before she calls on Jaya to answer. As a result, she has better choices: a dozen kids who’ve thought through an answer. If the first student’s answer needs developing she has lots of students she can call on. And they’re likely to have more thoughtful answers than what

---

<!-- Page 499 -->

she'd have likely gotten from the student whose hand went up as soon as Maggie stopped talking.

For her next question, Maggie gives almost thirteen seconds of *Wait Time*. Again, you can see students starting to raise their hands, slowly, thoughtfully. Note the girl in the front row towards the right who starts to raise her hand, puts it down, and then slowly raises it again. She's wrestling, apparently, with whether to try to join in or not. Perhaps she's wondering whether she should risk it. Perhaps she's wondering whether her answer is solid enough yet. But the extra time allows her to overcome her doubts or refine her answer. She opts in. At the same time, several students are using the time to scan the book for useful insights, a fact made evident by Maggie's narration.

A similar process plays out again in the seven seconds of *Wait Time* that Maggie offers in response to her third question: “What does Atticus say about mockingbirds again?” What's striking here are the high levels of participation, enthusiasm, and reflection among Maggie's students. They love the book, are invested in it, and so are thinking deeply. Or is it the other way around? Do they love and feel investment in the book because she's caused them to reflect deeply on it?

Implementing *Wait Time* can be challenging. It is hard to discipline yourself to allow time to pass after a question, and it takes a bit of practice. Making a habit of silently counting to three in your head or narrating your intention to wait (for example, “I'll give you a few seconds ... OK, let's see what you have to say”) can help.

Even so, there's no guarantee that students will use *Wait Time* to think. To confound the issue, it's hard to assess what students do with the time you give. It may not necessarily be apparent to students how they should respond to your waiting. What this tells us is that there are

---

<!-- Page 500 -->

steps necessary to teach, remind, and acculturate your students to use *Wait Time* effectively and ensure it is as productive as it can be.

## Step 1: Narrate Hands

As I discussed earlier, students are more likely to think productively about a question if they expect to answer it. The degree to which students think during *Wait Time* is in part a function of their expectations about what's going to happen next. If students expect to use the ideas they generate, they are likely to put *Wait Time* to good use. *Cold Calling*, the technique I will come to next, is one way to address this—it makes it possible that anyone might be called on and so socializes readiness and engagement during time allotted for thinking. But being *Cold Called* is far from a surety and even better and more reliable, is students' own expectations of their likely actions. A student who thinks, “I seek to raise my hand” is a student who does the thinking. If students believe that what one does after time spent thinking is to offer to share ideas, if they expect to raise their hands, they have internalized a belief that causes them to engage in active thinking. The correlation is imperfect, of course, but if the expectation—I will probably raise my hand—becomes the norm, optimal thinking is likely to as well.

Sadly though, there are a great many classrooms where hands in the air are infrequent or limited to a few students, and where nonparticipation is a matter of course, sometimes a norm. In such classrooms, *Wait Time* will be less effective and the ratio will be lower. If the productivity of the *Wait Time* is influenced by the likelihood of a hand being raised afterwards, one productive move, especially early in the year, is to encourage, foster, and socialize hand-raising by narrating hands.

---

<!-- Page 501 -->

Let's say you ask, “What was the purpose of the first Continental Congress?” Maybe one or two students raise their hands. Others sit passively. Most students, probably, are engaged in a subtle and silent calculus: *Is the teacher really expecting us all to raise our hands?* Your first goal is to build a norm, the expectation that most of the class probably will. You can do this by “elevating its visibility,” Peps McCrea points out, by increasing an action’s “profusion” (the portion of students who do it) and its “prominence”—how much people notice the behavior and believe that you value it. “One hand,” you say out loud. “Two hands. Now three.” You are building momentum. Perhaps a fence-sitter, a student who had something they might offer but who was warily reading the classroom norm, now raises her hand. “Four hands,” you say, smiling, relaxed, not rushed. You want hands but especially hands of students who have taken their time. “Five,” you say. “Thank you, Kesha. Thanks, Lance. Nice. Now I’m starting to see those hands.”

Your message is: I notice and I care when you raise your hand and, increasingly, many of your classmates are doing it.

In the video *Josefina Maino: I Need More Hands*, you can see Josefina narrating the hand-raising in her math classroom at Astoreca School in Santiago, Chile. “What does it mean that an inequality has a ‘set of solutions’?” she asks. Here’s the scene, after she’s allowed perhaps four or five seconds of wait time:

---

<!-- Page 502 -->

It's typical of classrooms everywhere. Four hands are raised: enough for her to be able to find someone to call on. Over the course of the lesson, four or five hands means it won't be as awkward as when it's just two kids. She can teach under these conditions. Many teachers do.

But it's worth asking: How many of those students sitting with their hands down are thinking? How many are answering the question? Could Josefina build a culture in which they were expected to engage and thus thought more actively about things, like what we mean by a set of solutions to an inequality?

Yes, she could, as we soon see. She starts merely counting hands, making it clear that she's values breadth of participation. Just the act of counting hands out loud encourages more volunteering. She gets easily to twelve. She asks for sixteen volunteers as a minimum. Thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen go a little slower. Alonzo's is the sixteenth hand. Josefina thanks him. And calls on him. He was hesitant and she wants, now, to make him feel

---

<!-- Page 503 -->

successful, to cause him to persist in this new behavior of hand-raising that he's embraced.

She walks towards him, repeating the question to make sure he remembers it, but also making the connection feel more personal. It's a bit of *Warm/Strict* (technique 61), too —she reminds him nonverbally to answer in a complete sentence (*Format Matters*, technique 18)—and that’s the gesture she's making.

When Alonso rises to the occasion, the handshake from Josefina and the snaps of support from the class are beautiful—and encourage everyone in class to be hand-raisers as well.

There are lots of wrinkles you could add to the approach here to emphasize and value different things. For example, if you're trying to socialize risk-taking and encourage students to be comfortable raising their hands for hard questions or when they're not sure they're right, you might say, “Now I'm starting to see those *brave* hands.” Or you might say, “I especially love it when students raise their hand when they *aren't* sure. That shows me fearlessness.” You might signal to students that you aren't expecting a polished, final response: “This is a really tricky one. I'm curious about your initial reactions. Get us started and we'll work through it together.”

Or you could slow your cadence and be double-calm. “Two hands. Three hands. Take your time but push yourself to share.”

Or instead of counting you could just verbalize appreciation. “Thanks, Jeremy, for raising your hand. Thanks, Jasmine. Thanks, Carlos. Gonna give other folks a few more seconds.”

If you're still not getting enough hands, keep at it. Norms and expectations won't change all at once. But you can also

---

<!-- Page 504 -->

be ready with a few backstops, like saying “Hmmm. A lot of us seem unsure. Twenty seconds to discuss with your partner. Go.” You might even tell your students to put their hands down. “I want you all to take fifteen seconds and go back to the text and find the answer. I want to see everyone rereading, and I’ll tell you when you can raise your hands.” After fifteen or twenty seconds, you might say, “OK, now, hands!”

Or perhaps, “Hmmm. Surprised to see so few hands. Mark, tell us as much as you *think* you know.” That’s a *Cold Call*, as you probably know, but a pretty supportive one. And if Mark doesn’t have his hand raised but some students do, it communicates that all students in the room are part of the conversation, whether or not they’ve raised their hands. Reluctant students might as well get in on the game. You’d be using a bit of loving accountability to support the gentle encouragement. Together they are likely to make a difference.

The video *Aidan Thomas: Wait Time Montage* shows a compendium of Aidan’s narrating hands techniques. You can see how his energy is always positive and how he varies his approach but is constantly at it throughout this class period. He’s building a culture of hand-raising.

## Step 2: Prompt Thinking Skills

Once you’ve normalized and reinforced the expectation of hand-raising, another productive action to get the most out of *Wait Time* is to *prompt thinking skills*. This is a step by which you teach students how to make *Wait Time* useful by providing guidance about *how* to use their three or five or twelve seconds to be most productive. For example:

> “I’m seeing people thinking deeply and jotting down thoughts. I’ll give everyone a few more seconds to do”

---

<!-- Page 505 -->

that.”

“I'm seeing people going back to the chapter to see if they can find the scene. That seems like a great idea.”

“I'm hoping someone will be able to connect this scene to another play, ideally *Macbeth*.”

“I'm going to give everyone lots of time because this question is tricky. Your first answer may not be the best.”

It's an assumption that students know they can and should do things like this in the brief periods of time you provide for thinking, in other words. In each of these cases, the teacher is explaining things that, as expert learners, we know are productive actions. They can be pragmatic—to jot down ideas, check your notes, or glance back through the text—or more abstract: to think about broader connections or to double-check your first thought. Knowing how to use such actions starts with being aware of them.

About a minute into the video *Akilah Bond: Keystone*, Akilah asks, “How did Cam help Eric find the note?” She reminds a few students to put their hands down to ensure that they use their Wait Time and then, pointing to the notes of the class' earlier discussion, notes, “Imani's looking at what we know about the characters. Nice move.” The purpose of the notes is to reinforce students’ memory of key moments in the story. Just the kind of thing that's obvious to adults but not to second graders, perhaps, so Akilah is reinforcing that it's the ideal thing to review to help their thinking. Between that and reminding them to put their hands down and take their time, she's teaching them how to use Wait Time when they get it.

### Step 3: Make Wait Time Transparent

---

<!-- Page 506 -->

When you intend to give students more than a handful of seconds of *Wait Time*, it's helpful to make that fact explicit to them so that they can manage their actions accordingly, especially as they get better and better at using *Wait Time* to build ideas. Doubly so, if you are giving them longer stretches of *Wait Time*.

Let's say I'm a student in your class and you ask a rigorous question, something like, “What political forces pulled the border states toward the Confederacy, and how did Lincoln respond to them?” You give the class some *Wait Time*, and I start to reflect. After about five seconds, I've come up with a few nascent ideas—I'm ready to be called on—and I begin to wind down my thinking.

But let's say you were hoping for something a little more robust—you were hoping I'd be ready to cite a few specific incidents and describe how they connect, and you'd decided to give the class twenty or thirty seconds of *Wait Time* to make sure we thought deeply. I'd be more likely to meet your expectations if you made your intentions transparent by saying something like, “This is a hard question. It requires you to reflect on multiple factors. I'll give you thirty seconds or so.”

Now I can gauge my thinking accordingly. I would start off understanding that this was no throwaway moment and would persist in reflecting because you'd told me about how much *Wait Time* to expect. If not, you might give me thirty seconds to think only to have me not use it, simply because I didn't know you were going to give it to me.

## Step 4: Give Real Think Time

The fourth step is simple: stop talking. This is critical because the first steps require you to narrate things and interrupt student thinking. This must be balanced with *real think time*, which, because it requires inaction, can be hard

---

<!-- Page 507 -->

to remember to provide. Counting silently to yourself can help you build the necessary habit of self-discipline. You might also walk around your room as you wait, with the goal of waiting until you reach a specific spot on the other side of the room before you call on someone. Or you might use the clock to your advantage, saying, “I’ll call on someone in ten seconds,” and forcing yourself to wait until the second hand releases you. After the socializing of hand-raising and the praising, remember that this is the most important part: there has to be some time when no one is talking, when students are thinking. By your silence, you are intimating that this is as important as anything they will do all day.

# TECHNIQUE 34: COLD CALL

*Cold Call*, the practice of calling on students regardless of whether they have raised their hand, is a profoundly important technique that can elicit a chain of surprising and positive effects in the classroom. There are few techniques that can transform a learning environment for the better as quickly. That said, because it is such a powerful technique, it’s important that it be used correctly. Fortunately, getting a few simple things right makes *Cold Call* highly likely to help you build an inclusive, rigorous, and, frankly, happy classroom.

I’m going to start by sharing two videos that I think help demonstrate with clarity how to make *Cold Call* effective. The first is of Denarius Frazier in his tenth-grade geometry class. The second is of Na’Jee Carter in his second-grade reading group. Because I love these videos and think they have so much to teach us I’m first going to narrate each of them chronologically; then I’ll go back and explain the key principles of effective *Cold Calling*.

---

<!-- Page 508 -->

Let's start with *Denarius Frazier: Parts of a Circle*. It's the beginning of class and Denarius has planned some *Retrieval Practice* to encode key concepts in long-term memory before pushing on to new content. “Take a second to look at this diagram,” he says, “And get ready for some questions… .” As he does this, a warm and welcoming smile lights up his face. Though he hasn't asked a single question yet, several important things have already happened.

First, Denarius has indicated to his students that he is preparing to *Cold Call* (he uses the technique frequently, especially at the beginning of class, and his statement “I'm going to ask you some questions” cues them to expect it here).

With the *Cold Call* coming, all students know they might be responsible for answering, so their attention and focus increase. This is so universally important it's easy to overlook: We can only learn what we attend to. Students are far more likely to think attentively about each question and answer it in their head because they may be asked to answer out loud. Denarius's questions are likely to elicit maximum thinking for all students and verbal answers from some of them.

Denarius's smile is also important. It says *I care about you* or *I want you to be successful* or *This is a good thing*. There's a loving accountability for students to stay focused on the math. This is what adults who care about young people do.

Denarius's first question is, “Give me an example of a radius … [pause] … Ricardo,” and everyone in the room glances at the diagram and searches for an example of a radius during that pause.

If he had said, “Who can give me an example of a radius?” and taken hands, some students would have known they

---

<!-- Page 509 -->

would be answering because they planned to raise their hands. Some, though, would not find a radius because they hadn't planned to raise their hands or weren't yet sure if they wanted to participate. The ratio would be low.

If he had said, “Ricardo, give me an example of a radius,” and used the *Cold Call*, then other students might or might not have taken the time to think through the answer to this particular question about the radius since they knew the *Cold Call* was directed to Ricardo. But the way Denarius frames the question causes every student to do the work during the pause between the question and the identification of the person who will answer. The recipe here is: Question. Pause. Name. The timing means every student in Denarius’s class is searching the diagram for an example of a radius in preparation for the possible *Cold Call*. The ratio has been multiplied, if not by thirty, at least manyfold.

A small thing: Denarius gives his students six or seven seconds of *Wait Time* here to observe and think about the diagram before he even asks the first question. In fact there's *Wait Time* throughout. This reminds us of something else important. *Cold Call* is never a “gotcha.” Denarius is not trying to catch students daydreaming or embarrass them into paying attention; the intention behind the technique is to set them up to succeed. Giving them the time to get oriented and to think through their answers helps with that. Effective teachers make students feel safe and successful even as they cause them to be more accountable and attentive.

There's further wisdom in the video as well: the universality of Denarius's *Cold Calls*, for example. It's clear he's not picking on Ricardo—or anyone else—because so many people get *Cold Called* throughout the lesson. It's not the strugglers or the kids in the back row or any

---

<!-- Page 510 -->

identifiable group. It's just how we do it here. *Cold Call* comes to everyone because Mr. Frazier cares that everyone is thinking, engaged, and participating. By spreading his *Cold Calls* around the room, Denarius indicates that he's attentive to the progress of every single student.

Denarius also emphasizes the universality and positivity of the technique by smiling as he quizzes students. Here he is asking Shamari to identify a chord:

USE
F
C

There's another critical moment when Denarius calls on Shamari and she answers incorrectly, mistaking a diameter for a chord. Teachers worry about what to do if a student

---

<!-- Page 511 -->

freezes or gets an answer wrong when they've been *Cold Called* (in fact, it's one key reason why some are reluctant to try the technique, an important consideration for trainers and school leaders to be aware of), but Denarius provides a simple and effective solution. He responds with a *Turn and Talk* to let everyone discuss the question. Implicit in this decision is the idea that if Shamari didn't know, others probably didn't as well. (You could also make this assumption explicit by saying it out loud: “Hmm. Tough question. I bet lots of us are struggling with it. Let's review.”) Coming out of the *Turn and Talk*, there's another *Cold Call* to make sure students engaged fully.

Now let's step into Na’Jee’s classroom to watch the video *Na’Jee Carter: Cold Call Montage*. His reading group is discussing internal and external conflict in stories. After a quick *Call and Response* where students answer that there are two types of conflict, Na’Jee *Cold Calls* Marcel to identify them. “Marcel, talk to me …” he says. Na’Jee’s language choice here is striking. He hopes Marcel will know but he's given himself a bit of wiggle room. What is the wrong answer to the question “Talk to me”? Na’Jee can turn almost any answer from Marcel into a positive starting point for the discussion. He can make Marcel and the group feel successful right from the outset, and increase their motivation and sense of progress. They will be more engaged and more willing to take academic risks throughout. We see this cycle of early success in motivating participants even with adults at our workshops, where people sometimes are reluctant to risk raising their hand in front of 100-plus people. Typically if we start the day by *Cold Calling* them in a way that ensures their success, they begin raising their hands of their own volition. Through *Cold Call*, they have successfully entered the conversation and have grown comfortable speaking in front of 100 colleagues. *Cold Call* has allowed them to take the risk and

---

<!-- Page 512 -->

prove something to themselves; motivation, confidence, and hand-raising all increase.

With that in mind, the phrasing of Na’Jee’s second question borders on brilliant: “Tell me about the internal conflict, Yedidiah …” Again, the openness of the question allows Yedidiah many ways to contribute to the conversation. He is capable of contributing, even if doesn’t know every last piece of the answer. Na’Jee makes it safe to start without having to be perfect.

Na’Jee's third *Cold Call* is a bit trickier. He's increasing the challenge a bit now but when Yedidiah gets it, Na’Jee’s appreciation is simple and quick but lovely: “You got it, dude.”

There are two more *Cold Calls* immediately after: “Can you tell me about that conflict, Marcel?” and “And what kind of conflict was that, Mark?” and then Na’Jee’s most interesting question stem yet: “Yedidiah, I want you to *start to speak* about what sort of conflict you already see evidence for. …”

The framing suggests, in asking Yedidiah to *start to speak*, that of course he won’t be able to cover everything. He’s asked merely to get the class started. If there are follow-ons to expand Yedidiah's thinking, well, we expected that from the start and Yedidiah will experience his contribution to the conversation not as incomplete, but rather as exactly what was helpful to the class at that moment. In other words, he will feel successful.

As with Denarius's class, you can readily see warmth and positivity in Na’Jee’s *Cold Call*. He, too, is smiling while he *Cold Calls*. In the following photo he is listening to Marcel’s answer to his first *Cold Call*, relaxed and smiling. His smile says to his student: *This Cold Call lets me hear your voice. It’s a good thing.*

---

<!-- Page 513 -->

The first type of conflict is the internal conflict.

Notice also in the next photo, Na’Jee’s body language after he has *Cold Called* Yedidiah and is listening to his answer. His body language—eyes on Yedidiah, facial expression of genuine interest, tilted head as if he's considering each fascinating phrase—is a different form of positivity. Na’Jee looks like a college student listening to a peer in a seminar. His body language says: *What you are saying is interesting and important. I am listening. I value it.* This is as important to positivity as a smile—possibly more so. He is building and reinforcing scholarly identity.

---

<!-- Page 514 -->

There are five key principles implicit in effective *Cold Call*, all of which Denarius and Na’Jee have modeled already. They are: positivity, predictability, universality, intentionality, and connectedness.

## Principle 1: Keep *Cold Call* Positive

Both Denarius and Na’Jee endeavor to make a *Cold Call* feel positive and natural. Their smiles are the biggest indicator of this and they remind students to relax, that their teacher wants them to do well. You can also verbalize this idea so it’s even more obvious. “We’re going to do *Retrieval Practice* with *Cold Call* to help us remember these ideas. I’m excited to see how we do.” Or you could say what Brittney Moore says to her third graders as she’s observing student work and preparing to *Cold Call* in the video *Brittney Moore: So Hard to Choose*. “It’s going to be so hard to choose one person to share out,” she says, her voice upbeat with excitement. The implication is clear: You

---

<!-- Page 515 -->

choose someone to *Cold Call* because you love their work and the class will benefit from hearing their thinking. Under those conditions, there's scarcely a child who wouldn't want to be *Cold Called*. After all, it's an honor. Or check out the video *Summer Payne: Individual Turns*, which I've retrieved from the archives of *TLAC 1.0* (those super-cute kindergarteners are probably in college by now!) so you could enjoy her singing “individual tu-urns, listen for your na-ame” and be reminded that the positivity of this or any technique is almost always within your control. I mean, your *Cold Call* is your turn. Who doesn't want their turn?

Listening behaviors are also important to establish the positivity of *Cold Call*—think here of Na’Jee’s tilted head listening to Yedidiah. They make the interaction feel like a conversation, not a quiz show, with the positivity deriving from the feeling that the teacher values students’ ideas. A bit of head nodding or other gesturing that communicates something like, *what you are saying now is very interesting*, is always helpful, as is movement. Somehow a teacher who is walking slowly as she listens communicates a kind of professional interest.

Of course the greatest source of positive emotions for students during *Cold Call* is their own success, and it's a powerful motivator. *Cold Call* requires that students engage in an activity that may be challenging, unpredictable, and maybe even cause a bit of healthy tension. And then they succeed. That feeling of success can be powerful, even more so because they've succeeded at something that is hard. This doesn't mean all *Cold Call* questions should be easy—the challenge has to be real. But all the more reason that teachers should plan their *Cold Call* sequences to *begin* with a question that sets students up to succeed as a preamble to greater challenge. Then students, as we saw in

---

<!-- Page 516 -->

Na’Jee’s video, can ride the cycle of success-motivating-success for the duration of the lesson.

One additional aspect of *Cold Call* that leads to positivity can occasionally elude teachers when they aren't prepared: both the question and the ideal answer should be clear. Every teacher has had the experience of asking a student a question that, in retrospect, was confusing or unclear. It's doubly important to avoid this kind of question when *Cold Calling*, when it is essential that students are maximally set up for success. Many teachers address this challenge by planning their exact questions and answers word for word as part of their lesson-planning process.

One final bit of guidance in making sure *Cold Call* is a positive experience is to do a bit of culture building around how to respond when students have been *Cold Called* and aren't sure of the answer. Consider the power of explaining to students in advance what to do if (1) they don't know the answer (“Say, ‘I’m not sure’ and then add ‘but’ and then give me your best guess,” or “Restate the question and tell me why or how you're confused”); or (2) their classmate can't answer (“Be supportive. Smile warmly and keep your eyes on them. Don't raise your hand until they're done trying, and remember that all of us will be there at some point.”)

## Principle 2: Make *Cold Call* Predictable

In some ways *Cold Call* works backwards: it's designed to influence what precedes it, to cause everyone to think harder by creating an expectation that anyone might end up being asked to answer just afterwards. This means that the more likely it is that students see a *Cold Call* coming, the more focused, active, and attentive they will be during the thinking that precedes it. Thus *Cold Calling* should be predictable. Using it regularly is one of the best ways to do

---

<!-- Page 517 -->

that. If *Cold Call* is an everyday thing, students will make a habit of increased attentiveness and get better and better at responding.

It’s also important to think about the converse: If your *Cold Calls* surprise students, they may learn a lesson (“Darn, I should have been ready!”), but one too late to help them. They may also feel ambushed, caught off guard, and therefore more likely to be thinking about the past (*Why did she do that?*) than about the future (*I’m going to be ready!*). A *Cold Call* should never feel like a “gotcha” to students, and to use it that way—to try to embarrass Marcus a little bit by asking, “What did I just say, Marcus?” because you don’t think he was paying attention—is to take a powerful and positive learning tool and cause it to undergo a counterproductive mutation that undermines trust between teacher and students.

You can see evidence of predictability in Denarius and Na’Jee’s classrooms—mostly in the fact that students seem so unsurprised by their *Cold Calling*. They react naturally and … well, honestly, they hardly react at all. *Cold Call* is a familiar occurrence to them. In fact there’s a bit of an equation implicit in that: the *more* it happens, the *more* *naturally* it unfolds and the *more* comfortable students become. If the response by students is so-so at first, keep at it. Make sure you’ve got the positivity, make sure your questions are good, and then persist. Over time it will become part of the fabric of your classroom and the biggest benefits will accrue when it does that.

Another way you can make *Cold Call* predictable is to make it transparent—to tell students it’s coming. For example: “Take a few minutes to work on this then I’ll *Cold Call* a few of you to hear your thoughts.” Suddenly the incentive to do one’s best work is even stronger. “Turn and Talk with your neighbor, and I’ll *Cold Call* a couple of groups to share after

---

<!-- Page 518 -->

your conversations.” You can also signal that students can expect it during class by *Cold Calling* right at the beginning. Not only does this let students know it’s coming and keep them engaged all lesson long, but to the degree that you find it awkward to start *Cold Calling* the first few times you do it, it’s actually easier to do it right away. You can plan it and then there’s no awkward feeling to overcome when it suddenly starts.

Another essential step in making *Cold Call* predictable to your students is a rollout speech. Na’Jee’s and Denarius’s can’t be seen in these videos because they happened on the first day or two of school. A rollout is the ultimate in predictability—you make the what, the why, and the how totally transparent to students before using the technique so they see it coming and know how to react. You might say something like:

In this class I’m going to *Cold Call* you. That means I may ask for you to answer a question or share your opinion, whether or not you’ve raised your hand. This allows me to balance who participates and to hear from everyone. And sometimes I want to know what you and you alone are thinking. I’ll try to remember to smile when I *Cold Call*, which is my way of reminding you that I always want you to do well. So if I call on you, do your best, even if you feel a little nervous. If you’re stuck, tell us what you’re confused about, and we’ll help you out. That’s what your classmates and I are here for. But, honestly, I think you’re going to surprise yourself. Let’s try a bit now…

BreOnna Tindall of Denver School of Science and Technology, whose teaching figures throughout this book, shared some great details of her rollout. “I tell them the difference between the different types of calls—I’ll look for volunteers, I love hands, we’ll do some warm calling. I

---

<!-- Page 519 -->

might put a star on your page if I'm going to call on you.  
And there's also *Cold Call*, which is another opportunity for me to vary the voices in the room because sometimes I know that you know the material, maybe you're just shy, maybe you need a push, maybe you don't know that you know. We talk about that [when I roll out *Cold Call*] and they feel excited for the most part.”  

The last thing that can help make *Cold Call* feel natural and predictable in your classroom is practice—your own. An awkward and hesitant lead-in to the *Cold Calling* by the teacher makes students awkward and hesitant. Denarius and Na’Jee’s *Cold Calling* seems natural, seamless, and conversational in part because they've done it a lot, but rehearsing a few times before class can help when you're just starting out. It's especially helpful to practice the first *Cold Call* or two—that's the one where you're most likely to pause or hesitate or suddenly change course. And since your working memory will likely be under intense pressure the first time you try it, practice smiling warmly when you rehearse—this will make it more likely that it comes off positively the first few times you try.  

## Principle 3: *Cold Call* Should Feel Universal  

Teachers who use *Cold Call* take pains to make it clear that *Cold Calls* are universal. They come, without fail, to everyone and are not an effort to single out students for lack of attentiveness, in response to specific behaviors, or according to some other hidden calculus. You can see this clearly in Denarius's class. He *Cold Calls* seven students—enough to make it clear that anyone might be called, not just particular individuals or groups of students. This is typical. He tends to *Cold Call* in batches so that it doesn’t appear as though one person is “in the teacher's sights.” And he's careful to *Cold Call* all types of students—not just those whose attention might be questioned, say, or who are

---

<!-- Page 520 -->

obviously high or low on the achievement scale. Finally, there's nothing in his affect—squinting, for example—to make it seem as though he's looking for someone or some behavior to latch on to. The seven students he *Cold Calls* are evenly spread out around the room. These aspects seem trivial but they are visual reminders that *Cold Call* is about expectations—“This is how we do it here”—and Denarius underscores this by asking *Cold Call* questions in a calm, even tone, with a smile or a look of sincere interest.

Be cautious, then, of tying your *Cold Calls* to specific behaviors when you're not sure students are eager to be called on. If you say, “Hmm, I see you hiding over there, Caitlin,” you not only risk making Caitlin self-conscious but also cause students to think about whether they look as though they are hiding and how they should look if they do (or don't) want to be *Cold Called*.

Of course there are times when the *Cold Call* is personal. Sometimes we do want to message to a student, I chose you for a reason; I want to hear your opinion; your voice matters. But that reason should almost always be a positive one. You are selected as an honor, or because of a unique perspective, or because I want you to know your voice matters. Brittney Moore's beautiful *Cold Calling* where she describes how she can't decide who to call on is a great example. Occasionally it will be clear to a student that they've been selected because they've made a common error that's worthy of study. If you intend to try that, make sure to read *technique 12*, *Culture of Error*, to make sure the context makes students feel secure and supported.

Na’Jee is also using *Cold Call* in a small group. In a way that's systematic, as it signals that *Cold Call* applies everywhere. Some teachers tend to think of small groups as more informal and not the place where systems and techniques apply. But it's also worth remembering why we

---

<!-- Page 521 -->

are in small groups (for example, reading groups): We think what we're doing there is so important that we are willing to multiply the amount of resources we apply per student. If that's the case, we should use the systems that build productivity and focus too. Na’Jee is warm and welcoming with his reading group of four but he *Cold Calls* nonetheless. So do Brittney and Summer.

## Principle 4: Cold Call Intentionally

Perhaps this is the unspoken principle that supports the other four, but it is helpful to say directly: Although your *Cold Calls* may sometimes or often appear random to your students, they should usually be intentional and, often, planned before you execute. In *Chapter Two*, Lesson Structure, I discuss deciding in advance whom to call on—either specific students or categories. Your notes might say, *CC Abraham/Sasha* or *CC two quieter voices* or *circulate to CFU and CC an “almost right.”* These require you to use data—either from assessments, such as *Exit Tickets*, or from real-time observations during the lesson. Brittney Moore *Cold Calls* one of her students three or four times in the lesson we taped. She wanted to give her extra practice because, in looking at the data the night before, Brittney had noticed that this student was struggling and wanted to make sure she got lots and lots of at-bats. Sometimes you will have to make the choice of whom to call on with a tighter turnaround, after *Active Observation*, for example. Then you’ll want to use student responses to determine whom you will call on after the moment of *Everybody Writes* or *Turn and Talk*.

Most of the time when you *Cold Call* a student to contribute their thoughts to the conversation, you should have a decent guess of what they are going to say—or you should select them because of what you know about their patterns of academic participation, success, and struggle.

---

<!-- Page 522 -->

**Pre-Call:** In Pre-Call, you reveal to the student you call on that your *Cold Call* is intentional by letting them know in advance that you will be asking them to speak. Christine Torres does this during her Keystone lesson when she tells Makaye during the *Turn and Talk*, “I’m coming to you to share.” This tips a student off that you will *Cold Call* them. This can allow extra time to prepare or to imply that their idea is especially worthy, thus building positivity. You could also use pre-call before students have completed their work to incentivize effort. “I’m going to call on you for question #4. Make sure you’ve taken time to double-check it.” You can also occasionally use it to signal discussion dynamics from the outset. For example, after a few minutes of writing about how the protagonist is changing, you might kick off the conversation by saying, “Can’t wait to hear your thoughts. Let’s start the discussion with Jasmine, then Carlos, and then Imani. Make sure you build off each other and use your *Habits of Discussion* …”

Teachers are sometimes concerned that using *Cold Call* may be counterproductive by making students anxious. It’s important to be aware of students’ concerns and also to do our best to assuage their anxieties. I very rarely see a student who cannot adapt relatively quickly—almost never in classrooms where *Cold Call* has been rolled out positively and according to the principles I describe in this chapter. There is not much to be anxious about in being asked questions by a caring adult.

That said, no two human beings are the same and you may at some point have a student who struggles with *Cold Call*. I offer two bits of guidance in such a case: first, an extra bit of relationship building goes a long way. Speaking to a student privately and reassuring them of your appreciation

---

<!-- Page 523 -->

of them and your belief in their ability to handle any of your classroom expectations is a good first step. Second, offer initial modifications; for example, let the student know in advance via a pre-call or perhaps a nod that a *Cold Call* is coming the first few times you use it. If that's the case I would also suggest engineering the student’s first experiences so they are sure to be successful—and the student is able to answer and feel quietly successful (as opposed to heaping on a lot of praise, which might only make the student self-conscious). “Please read the directions for me, Chris,” is a great starting point (the answer is right in front of them). It’s worth noting that the most effective response to anxieties—even those far more pronounced and debilitating than a bit of nervousness—is “gradual systematic exposure” to anxiety-inducing phenomena, as Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff note.10 The solution to a child who’s afraid to jump into the pool is to encourage him to do so in an environment of psychological safety. The accomplishment of the task usually conquers the fear.

## Principle 5: Connect Your Cold Calls

From the teacher's perspective much of *Cold Calling* is about deciding strategically who will talk (though it may appear random from the student's seat). But in many ways *Cold Calling* is also about socializing *listening*, and the fifth principle is about maximizing that potential. Unbundling and using follow-on prompts are two ways to do that.

When you “unbundle,” you break up larger questions into a series of smaller questions, ideally with contingent answers, and distribute them to multiple students. This can help build energy and momentum in your pacing; it also builds a culture of peer-to-peer accountability. Answering one part of the question requires students to listen and react to the previous answer. Consider, first, Ms. Martin

---

<!-- Page 524 -->

who has *Cold Called* D'Juan to ask him how to find the volume of a cylinder. The class listens while D'Juan ably describes the necessary calculations, but they become increasingly passive participants to the exchange. Actually, D'Juan really knows his stuff and he proudly stretches out his answer so it's as thorough and methodical as it can be. Ironically this has a counterproductive effect on the class. The longer the answer goes on, the easier it is to tune out. Students realize they won't be answering this question.

Now, compare that sequence to this one, in which Ms. Martin unbundles the question:

Ms. Martin: How many variables and constants do we have to consider in finding the volume of a cylinder, D'Juan?  
D'Juan: Three of them.  
Ms. Martin: Good. Tell me one, Janella.  
Janella: Radius.  
Ms. Martin: OK, and D'Juan, is that a variable or a constant?  
D'Juan: Radius is a variable.  
Ms. Martin: OK, so what's the other variable, Carl?  
Carl: Height is the other variable.  
Ms. Martin: Good. So, what's the constant that we need, Kat?  
Kat: Pi.  
Ms. Martin: And how do we know it's a constant, Jameer?  
Jameer: Well, because it never changes.  
Ms. Martin: Good. So, Taylor, when I multiply my constant and my two variables, I get my volume, right?

---

<!-- Page 525 -->

Taylor: Well, no, you need to square your radius.  
Ms. Martin: Ah, yes. Thank you, Taylor. Well done.  

By breaking up a single question into pieces and *Cold Calling* multiple students, Ms. Martin keeps all students on their toes; in making questions contingent on one another, she causes students to attend even more closely to what the others say. Not only were six students engaged actively where only one had been before, but all students were likely thinking through the answers silently, given the plausibility of being called on. And because the students are all working together toward answering a question, unbundling tends to build a positive cohesive culture. It makes school a team sport.  

Follow-on is the term for sequencing a series of more open-ended prompts that similarly cause students to listen to, reflect on, and expand one another's answers. Let's say Ms. Carrasco is teaching her students about plate tectonics.  

Ms. Carrasco: Jennifer, what does this tell us causes earthquakes?  
Jennifer: The plates.  
Ms. Carrasco: Doing what?  
Jennifer: The plates colliding.  
Ms. Carrasco: Can you develop that a bit, please ... Jalen?  
Jalen: Well the plates collide and sometimes one slides under the other but other times they scrape alongside each other.  
Ms. Carrasco: Good addition, Jalen. One thing we haven't talked about is the role of pressure. Teana, can you add to that?

---

<!-- Page 526 -->

*Teana:* I think so. I think what happens is that as the plates collide in either of the ways Jalen talked about, the pressure builds up and builds up and then suddenly there's an earthquake.

In this sequence Ms. Carrasco has used follow-on prompts—phrases that explicitly ask students to expand upon or react to the previous answer in order to build a culture of listening. Her phrases are *Can you develop that, Jalen?* and *Can you add to that, Teana?* I'm sure you can imagine others. Agree or disagree is a common one though I tend to prefer prompts that don't limit potential responses to just two. It's worth noting the difference in her follow-ons: the first, to Jalen is open ended—he can develop in whatever way he wants—but Teana's comes with guidance—please talk about the role of pressure. In either case, effective listening is reinforced and made critical to success.

## Four Purposes for Cold Call

In the previous section, I discussed principles for *how to Cold Call*, but it's also important to know *why you are Cold Calling* so you can make adaptations accordingly. I can think of at least four purposes for the technique.

### Purpose 1: Voice Equity

Let me begin by describing a *Cold Call* of my own, one you might not think of as a *Cold Call* at first but one that I hope will frame the conversation about it in a new light. I have three children and at dinner recently the discussion was dominated by my two older children. Their voices were confident. Of course, we would want to know what happened to Aijah and Jane in math class or Nilaan and Derrin at soccer practice. My littlest sat quietly at the end of the table, tracking the conversation with her eyes. Her brother and sister are five and seven years older, so

---

<!-- Page 527 -->

perhaps she wondered: Were her stories from the day also relevant to the discussion? Would they meet with approval from her older siblings? When and how might she break in to try?

So I *Cold Called* her, turning to her at a tiny break in the discussion, and saying, "What about you, Goose? Are you still doing astronomy in science?"

She had not volunteered to join the conversation but I wanted her to know her voice mattered, and that her contributions were important. I wanted to show her the importance of her voice to the conversation. If she felt nervous, I wanted to break the ice for her.

There are few things more inclusive you can do than to ask for someone's opinion or input, especially when they do not yet know whether their voice is important in a room. To ask a student who has not volunteered, "What do you think?" is to tell them their voice matters. This idea is called "voice equity" and I first began to use it after a conversation with some colleagues who trained teachers for the Peace Corps in sub-Saharan Africa.

In many parts of the countries where they worked, "Girls are not called on," one of the team, Becky Banton, noted. There's an unspoken gender norm and girls often do not speak up readily. Sometimes the norm comes from their families and sometimes despite their families. The expectation is transmitted invisibly, socially, mysteriously—but inexorably.

"They sit quietly in the back of the room knowing the answers but not actively participating, not raising their hands, not going to the board," Becky noted.

"When our teachers *Cold Call*, especially when they know a girl has a good idea by having circulated first and they say, 'Come forward. Tell us your thinking,' the girls answer and

---

<!-- Page 528 -->

they succeed and you see it in their faces,” said Audrey Spencer. “It’s so fast. In the space of a single class. It builds their confidence and then we see an increase in their achievement.”

When there is a norm or an expectation that a student should not or cannot speak in class, be it societal (girls should be passive) or personal (there are three kids who volunteer; I am not one of them), the *Cold Call* breaks the norm for the student, absolving her of the responsibility for the violation of what is or appears to be a social code and perhaps even causing the student to see the code as a false construct.

*Cold Call* can remind a student that their voice matters and, often, that they are capable of participating credibly. In that sense it is a reminder that part of a teacher's responsibility is to reinforce everyone's right, legitimacy, and sometimes, just maybe, responsibility, to speak—for the sake of their own learning and to contribute to the classroom community.

In fact, a recent study suggests just how powerful *Cold Call* is in shaping students' beliefs and expectations about their own participation. The study, by Elisa Dallimore and colleagues, tested the effect of *Cold Call* on voluntary participation by assessing what happened over time to students in classes where *Cold Call* was frequently used by the teacher as compared to classes in which it was not used.^11 What they found was that “significantly more students answer questions voluntarily in classes with high cold-calling, and that the number of students voluntarily answering questions in high cold-calling classes increases over time.” There is a double effect, in other words. Not only do more students participate in classes where the teacher *Cold Calls* because of the *Cold Calls* directly, but also because afterwards—perhaps because they experience

---

<!-- Page 529 -->

success or perceive the norm of universal participation more strongly—they *begin to participate more by choice*. Further, the effect the authors describe “also increases over time.” The more the *Cold Calling* becomes part of the fabric of class the more profoundly it causes students to choose to raise their hands. Finally, students' affective response to class discussion changed. The authors found that students' comfort in participating also increased. Being *Cold Called* didn't cause stress; it caused comfort and confidence.

## Purpose 2: Creating a Culture of Engaged Attention and Loving Accountability

Later in this chapter—in [technique 36, Means of Participation](#)—you will see a soccer coach, James Beeston, explain to his players why he is going to *Cold Call* them during training: “Sometimes I might call on you guys even if your hand isn't raised, because the game requires you to be switched on at all times.” What James knows is that if the game demands it, practice must prepare them for it. His job is to help them be the best athletes they can be. Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child, as the expression goes. Somehow, we understand that a coach should prepare each athlete so they can hope to reach the highest level. This is the sign of a good coach and part of how a coach shows that he cares. Perhaps this is why the bonds between athletes and their coaches often run so deep.

Does it need to be said that teachers should prepare each learner as if they will go to the highest levels too? That this means a learning environment that also requires them to be, in James’s words, “switched on at all times”? To care about young people is to build an environment that lovingly and supportively prepares them for success, and that requires most of all effort and attention. Where people

---

<!-- Page 530 -->

direct and focus their attention and how successful they are at focusing that attention will play a large role in determining what they accomplish, in the classroom and more broadly. And attention is a habit, mostly shaped by both individual decisions and larger culture. The effect of smartphones on our capacity to concentrate should make that clear enough.

*Cold Call* is one of several tools that builds a lattice of loving accountability into your classroom culture. Certainly you can decide not to use it and leave your students' levels of effort and attention to chance. Many teachers do. But, in my opinion at least, it is a disservice to the young people we care about to not immerse them in a culture that socializes them to attend and focus and give their best every day. James *Cold Calls* because he cares. It is the same for a teacher.12

## Purpose 3: Checking for Understanding

As I discuss in [Chapter Three](), knowing the difference between “I taught it” and “They learned it” is the core challenge of teaching and requires effective, real-time data collection. This is one of *Cold Call*’s most important contributions. To fully assess what students in your class know you must be able to ask questions of any (and every) student at any time. Students who voluntarily participate are more likely to know the answer than the students who don’t. If you are limited to assessing only these students when you ask a question, you will never be able to assess all members of the class, and you will always think the class has learned more than it has. When you set out to use questions to assess students’ understanding, your default should be to use significant amounts of *Cold Call*. This will allow you to not only call on people “randomly” but to go one better and to call on what is likely to be a statistical sample of the room—or on students you are worried about.

---

<!-- Page 531 -->

These things are critical to ensuring the accuracy of the data you gather.

A second, related application: One of the biggest challenges in checking for understanding is the gap between performance and learning. What our students appear to be able to do at the end of a lesson is almost always in part a false positive. They have not yet begun to forget. We assess what we think our students know at the end of a lesson and even if their answers are all correct, we are likely to overestimate their knowledge because forgetting has not yet occurred. What's critical to arresting the pervasive force of forgetting is *Retrieval Practice* (see [technique 7](#)) and *Cold Call* is the best way to build *Retrieval Practice* into your lessons. It allows you to make your *Retrieval Practice* speedy and energetic so you can do it frequently. Students like it and it allows you to maximize the number of students retrieving every answer. Denarius Frazier's video *Parts of a Circle* is an example of this: He has ensured long-term mastery of key geometric terms via *Retrieval Practice*, and the *Cold Calling* makes sure everyone is benefiting.

## Purpose 4: Pacing

Picture this scene from a classroom near you. Mr. K is reviewing a problem set from last night's homework. He says, “OK, who'd like to tell us how they answered number 2 on the homework?” Pause. Crickets. Finally, after five or six seconds, Natalie raises her hand. Unfortunately, Natalie also answered the previous question, so Mr. K tries another approach. “I'm seeing the same two or three hands,” he says, scanning slowly and awkwardly. “Do I need to remind you that participation is graded in my class?” Teachers waste a great deal of time—ten or fifteen seconds per question, perhaps, but hours and hours over the long run, doing what Mr. K is doing: pleading for someone to answer

---

<!-- Page 532 -->

their questions. What's worse, hearing your teacher plead for someone to participate slows the pacing—students' perception of passing time—to a crawl. It would have been a lot simpler, a lot faster, and a lot less painful for everyone for Mr. K to say, “OK, let's take a look at the second problem. How'd you answer that one, Mamadou?”

One of the best ways to engage students in learning is to make it feel dynamic and worthwhile, to give it flow. This makes it feel like something important and engaging. Pleading for hands is the anti-flow. It announces that the train has come to a halt and is stuck on the tracks. It causes students to lose faith in a teacher's competence (“See, nobody even participates in Mr. K's class; he's so boring”) and in the value of the classroom. *Cold Call* is one of the best ways to control the pace of class, keeping things moving when you want (like Na’Jee Carter, who uses his *Cold Call* to keep things moving), or to slow things down a bit like Denarius Frazier, who uses it to disincentivize eager hand-raising that might put pressure on him and students to go faster.

## Two Common but Important Misconceptions

There are two common misconceptions about *Cold Call* that warrant discussion. In both cases they involve confusing *Cold Call* with a different technique.

The first misconception involves random generators—names of students written on popsicle sticks and drawn from a can or a computer app to select students at random to participate. Using such random generators is common and participants at workshops often suggest it as the best way to *Cold Call*. Random generators can be quite useful at times, but I want to explain why they are not to me an example of *Cold Calling*. Again, they're fine to use

---

<!-- Page 533 -->

sometimes but the reasons they are not a form of *Cold Call* are important and I want to take a moment to explain them.

The first reason is that sticks aren't strategic. Intentionality—whom you call on and when—matters. You choose to call on Daniella or Domari because they have a great answer or because they've been quiet or because they are often confused in similar situations or because they are your “still waters run deep” students (the ones who never volunteer, yet jaws often drop after their unexpected, insightful comments). Earlier I discussed the importance of deciding whom you will *Cold Call* and why. *Cold Call* is rarely actually random, though it may appear to be so from the students' perspective.

In fact, it's often beneficial to *communicate this intentionality to students*. Using a random generator makes it explicit that you are not making intentional decisions about who to call on, but this is often the most important part. For example, to say: “David, what are you thinking?” tells David that you value his unique opinion and are thinking about his perspective at that moment. To use sticks is to say, “Anyone can go next. It’s all about the same to me.” There is no longer anything special about David being asked his opinion, then; a popsicle stick made the choice.13 The message of inclusiveness—your voice matters—and voice equity is not communicated by randomness.

One other key difference is efficiency. Getting out the popsicle or lolly sticks takes time. Each time you pull one (“Oh, boy! Let’s see who it is! Whoops, Jaden’s not here …”) takes time. And it interrupts the flow of normal conversation. It’s hard for Amari to truly build off and elaborate on Janelle’s point if there’s a carnival event in between.

Again, I am not saying not to use popsicle sticks. One benefit is that they are psychologically easy and don’t

---

<!-- Page 534 -->

require as much bravery of teachers as *Cold Call*, so they can be a starting point for teachers who are anxious about not calling on students without their hands raised. And they can be a fun and easy way to remind your students that it's important for everyone to participate. They might work well with *Retrieval Practice*; the game-ishness of stick pulling is more of a match for content that is organized around specific questions than a discussion that relies on the continuity of comments. But please be clear: Popsicle sticks are not the same as *Cold Call*.

The second misconception has to do with a technique often called “hands down,” in which the teacher tells students to put their hands down because she is *Cold Calling*. Do this too many times and students may not raise their hands. Again my argument is not that “hands down” is not a valid approach—it's an adaptation of *Cold Call*—but I think it is one with limitations, so it's important to understand the differences.

One of the primary purposes of *Cold Call* is to build student engagement and involvement. One of the most important results of being *Cold Called*, in fact, is the increased desire to raise one's hand and the increasing belief that one is capable of contributing. This was a big part of the story for my colleagues in the Peace Corps—not just that *Cold Calling* allowed girls to participate where otherwise they would have met with social sanction, but that it caused them to gradually begin raising their hands on their own. Therefore we want to balance *Cold Calling* with hand-raising to provide opportunities for students to choose to participate, even while we are choosing them via *Cold Call*. Further, hand-raising provides critical data. How many hands we see and how eagerly they have been raised tells us a lot about our class and their interests and confidence. Of course it's fine to occasionally tell students to put their hands down—it can be a nice change of pace and saying

---

<!-- Page 535 -->

something like, “No hands for the next few minutes; I’m going to *Cold Call*,” can be especially helpful in making the *Cold Call* predictable. But since *Cold Calling* is something we can do just as easily when students are raising their hands, I think it’s best to most often allow hand-raising during *Cold Call*.

So … can “hands down” or popsicle sticks be useful and an occasional fun change of pace? Yes. But teachers often assume they achieve the same ends and value as *Cold Call*, and I just want to be clear on why I think they are different.

## Cold Call in Synergy

The videos I’ve chosen of Denarius and Na’Jee’s *Cold Calling* are unusual for a variety of reasons: first, because of the skill and proficiency they show. You’re watching masters at work, at least in my opinion, and that’s good to keep in mind if you’re just beginning to use the technique. Your *Cold Calling* may not look like theirs right away. Another thing that’s distinctive about these two videos is that they show Denarius and Na’Jee in the midst of sustained sequences of heavy reliance on *Cold Call*. This of course makes it easier to see and study how they do what they do. But it’s also a distortion. Much of their and other masters’ *Cold Calling* happens in combination with (and embedded within) other questioning and engagement techniques. In those instances the *Cold Call* itself occurs with less frequency but it is still essential because it works so well in synergy with other techniques. I write more about this synergy in technique 36, *Means of Participation*, and you can see this synergy in action in many of the Keystone videos.

In the video *Sadie McCleary: Keystone*, for example, Sadie begins reviewing answers as the *Do Now* ends. She *Cold Calls* Alissa, Alex, and N’Kaye, but then she sends students

---

<!-- Page 536 -->

into a *Turn and Talk* to review the rules of particle motion. There's a *Cold Call* for Sterling. Then another *Turn and Talk*. J'Karah is *Cold Called* to review. Next, another *Turn and Talk* and a pre-call for Habib. For the follow-up—why isn't “average kinetic energy” incorrect?—she takes volunteers. Then another *Turn and Talk* followed by a bit of written practice. Back and forth she goes, changing the format or *Means of Participation* (technique 36). But the ways that *Cold Call* works particularly well in combination with other techniques deserve reflection. It is, for example, an ideal backstop to an activity like a *Turn and Talk*, which you might use to boost the ratio in your classroom, because *Cold Calling* afterwards increases accountability and therefore engagement in decentralized tasks where you can't monitor what everyone is doing. The *Turn and Talk*, on the other hand, provides a counterbalance to *Cold Call* as it takes the attentive focus developed via *Cold Call* and channels it into a peer-to-peer interaction that maximizes active engagement. So Sadie is especially likely to use *Cold Call* before or after a *Turn and Talk*.

*Cold Call* is similarly ideal for increasing student attentiveness and effort during an *Everybody Writes*. Giving students two minutes to write about how Jonas is changing in the chapter, for example, is a great activity, but it's even better if you *Cold Call* Ella coming out of it—“Ella, please share a bit of what you wrote about.” And it’s even better still if you *Circulate* slowly, reading students' thoughts as they write them and then *Cold Call* to validate and discuss one particular answer —“Ella, I was struck by your use of the phrase ‘rising tension.’ Can you tell us a bit about what you meant and where you see it?” A bit of loving accountability after independent work, accomplished through occasional *Cold Calling*, helps students get the most out of the independent task.

---

<!-- Page 537 -->

# Timing the Name

Deciding where in the *Cold Call* you will name the student who is to answer is important. The default approach is to ask the question, pause, and then name a student—for example, “What’s three times nine [pause], James?” Using the sequence *question, pause, name* ensures that every student begins preparing an answer during the pause. For example, everyone does three times nine, with one student merely called on to give their answer aloud. Saying the name first, as in “Jairo, what’s three times nine?” will result in fewer students preparing the answer because they know they won’t be called on. Since the difference in ratio is significant (twenty-five students answering a question and one saying it aloud versus one student answering a question and twenty-five watching) is significant, so *question, pause, name* is the default.

In some cases, however, calling a student’s name first—*name, pause, question*—can be beneficial. It can cue a student to listen attentively before the question has been asked and increase the likelihood of success. This can be especially effective with students who might be reluctant to be *Cold Called* or who might struggle the first few times, perhaps because of language processing difficulties, or because knowledge of English is still developing. Using the name first can also help establish clarity about your *Means of Participation* (see *technique 36*). After a chorus of *Call and Response* (*technique 35*), for example, saying, “And, Damari, why do we multiple there?” would signal to students that you’re no longer asking students to call out answers. In some cases placing the name in the middle of the question—“And how does wind, Damani, play a role in the erosion process?”—can let your question pick up the conversational thread from the previous comment and create continuity, but confirm full attention from the student you’re *Cold Calling* so they hear the question.

<!-- Page 538 -->

# TECHNIQUE 35: CALL AND RESPONSE

*Call and Response* has two parts: a teacher asking a question or sharing information and the whole class responding aloud in unison to answer the question or repeat the phrase—for emphasis or to help encode it in memory. If you are doing *Retrieval Practice*, for example, sprinkling in a few opportunities where everyone responds increases memory building.

*Teacher:* What do we call it when two very different characters are put side by side for emphasis?  
*Class:* Juxtaposition!

Asking your class to answer or repeat in unison can also be a great change of pace that can expand participation and build energy and momentum. You can see Christine Torres using it at the beginning of the vocabulary section in her Keystone lesson. She introduces a new vocabulary word and asks her students to repeat it as a class.

*Christine:* The first word we're going to learn is the word *implore*. Implore on two—one, two ...  
*Class:* Implore!  
*Christine:* And the word “implore” means what? Read it for me, please, loud and proud ... [taking hands] ... Jovon?

Why use *Call and Response* here? First it gives every student the opportunity for a bit of practice. The practice isn't exactly *Retrieval Practice* but rather pronunciation, which is important, especially with vocabulary. If students aren't confident saying a word, if they don't know how to pronounce it, they'll be much less likely to use it or attend to it as they are reading. Students tend to skip over words they can't pronounce.^14^ So you'll notice then that every time Christine introduces a new word the whole class

---

<!-- Page 539 -->

practices saying it, quickly and efficiently. Then, as they use the word, they're more confident and fluent in using it.

There are other reasons to use *Call and Response* here as well. Christine's class starts with a bang. The energy and enthusiasm are high. You might watch her and think, Well, if my kids were that enthusiastic, I'd teach like that too, but the converse is actually more true. Her students are enthusiastic because of her teaching moves. There is, for example, a connection between Christine's use of *Call and Response* and the fact that practically every hand in the room goes up when she asks for a volunteer to read the definition. For one thing, everyone has already participated. More broadly, people respond to norms and Christine has made the norm of participation visible and universal. The more consistent and visible norms are, the more they influence people. Everyone is involved and also sees everyone else around them positively engaged in the lesson. The natural thing to do, then, is to continue to match the norm of enthusiastic engagement that's been set. You're more likely now to raise your hand.

But there's even more going on in this moment of *Call and Response*, I'd argue. Humans have evolved to rely on what has led to our survival as a species. Those things have as much to do with our ability to coordinate and build mutual bonds as with anything we do as individuals. We survived by forming cohesive productive groups, and as a result we not only yearn to be a part of said groups, but also feel comfort and belonging when we are within one. “The brain is a social organ,” Zaretta Hammond writes in *Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain*. “It has a ‘contact’ urge, a ‘desire to be with other people.’” Every society on earth sings, for example, in part because singing is a way of becoming a part of the collective. We sing together and join our voices. The emotions of doing so are often surprisingly

---

<!-- Page 540 -->

profound. This is why singing—and choral group singing specifically—is so often a part of worship all over the world.

Hammond also clarifies something fundamental about American—and Western—societies. We are ardent individualists. She cites Dutch psychologist Geert Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Index, which includes a ranking of every country in the world according to its level of individualism in society. The United States is at the far end of the spectrum (with the UK not far behind). We are the most individualist—or the least collectivist—society on earth. This has its benefits—rugged can-do, get-it-done self-reliance is generally a good thing—but it also raises some questions. The first is what it is like to engage in the schools of an anomalously individualistic society if you come from a less individualistic one. Part of being responsive to students from other cultures is understanding that they have a more group-oriented view of the world. All that *me* and *you* can seem strange when you are accustomed to *we*.

A second question is what wisdom there is for our ardently individualistic schools in a more collective approach. Collective knowledge, group reliance, and identity derived through shared endeavor are in fact good things for learning. They make our schools more inclusive and increase the sense of belonging.

As I discuss in *Habits of Attention*, to feel a part of something is one of the most profound motivators in the world, as Daniel Coyle points out in *The Culture Code*. And we rarely change our minds about something we believe to be true unless we feel a strong sense of connection to the person sharing information that might cause us to change, Jonathan Haidt explains in *The Righteous Mind*. Our beliefs are a reflection of who we feel like we belong with. We take

---

<!-- Page 541 -->

our identity from our community even if community is often fleeting in our society.

*Call and Response* is a tiny piece of the fabric of classroom culture, but done well it can create moments that build a sense of togetherness. Doing things in unison reminds us that we belong to a group. This is why *Call and Response* is motivating and why it is inclusive. It briefly but viscerally makes everyone in the room a part of something collective. Just maybe these moments feel a bit like the choral singing that is universal to societies and religions around the world.

It’s worth observing that *Call and Response* can evoke this feeling only to the degree that the response reinforces togetherness, that is, students are truly in unison. That’s why in-cues are so important. Christine’s is the same each time she uses it. It’s clear, crisp, and distinctive. If it’s not clear what she is asking students to do and the cue is ambiguous, students might hesitate to follow through. Or not follow through at all. And then the momentary power of “all of us with one voice” is lost.

“The next word is caustic. Caustic on two—one, two …” Christine says, elevating her voice to make the cue distinctive in another way. The response is crisp and energetic again because the cue is consistent.

# More on the *Call and Response* In-Cue

## In-Cues

*Call and Response* is about universality. All students should respond or the message is perverse and the benefits lessened. But for students to participate enthusiastically, they must confidently know when to sing out without fear that they will be the only one singing. To ensure this is the case, use a specific signal—often verbal (“Class!” “Everybody!” “One, two …”) to indicate that students should respond. Such a signal, called an *in-cue*, allows everyone to answer together and with confidence. Clarity of signal also lets you prevent called-out responses when you want to call on a student. Because in-cues are critical, it’s worth geeking out on them a little. There are several types of in-cues to consider.

## Count-Based In-Cue

Count-based in-cues are highly effective in that they are distinctive—you use them only for *Call and Response* and they make the timing of the response clear.15 Because they have a short countdown (Christine says, “On two: one, two …”), they give students just a moment to prepare and ensure that everyone is likely to be on cue.

## Group Prompt

Using a collective term for the whole class can also work, especially since the prompts often remind students of group membership: Saying “Everybody” or “Class” reminds students to expect universal participation. Should you fail to get it, you can simply

---

<!-- Page 543 -->

repeat the prompt with slightly greater emphasis:  
“Everybody, please.”

**Nonverbal Gesture**  

A third kind of in-cue is a nonverbal gesture: a point, a hand dropped, a looping motion with the finger. These have the advantage of speed and don't require you to interrupt the flow of the lesson. They can also be challenging, in that the tone has to be just right or they can seem schoolmarmish. Also there will be times when you might not have everyone's eyes (that is, finishing up notes or simply momentarily distracted), and then you run the risk of losing students in the response.

**Tone Shift**  

A fourth kind of in-cue employs a shift in tone and/or volume. The teacher increases inflection on and often the volume of the last few words of a sentence to imply a question; students recognize this as a prompt and respond crisply. This is often the most efficient form of *Call and Response*; in the long run, it's often the easiest to use—it's seamless, fast, and natural—but it's the hardest to use. It's easier for students to miss a cue and they will only recognize the in-cue if you use *Call and Response* consistently and frequently. If you don't feel immediately confident and comfortable with *Call and Response*, consider beginning, as many teachers do, by mastering a simpler cue.

Many teachers think of *Call and Response* as a technique that is applicable among younger students but less so among older students. They imagine both the ease and benefits of second graders, saying “Nice work, Cheyenne!” in unison as they do in the video *Akilah Bond: Keystone* or

---

<!-- Page 544 -->

“Nailed it!” as a group to celebrate Akheem's work in *Sarah Wright: Tio Luis*.

But while it looks different with high school students, it is still valuable, as you can see in *Sadie McCleary: Means of Participation*. She calls on a student to explain what the Celsius temperature scale is based on, and when his response suggests that he is unclear about the boiling point of water, Sadie recognizes this as a key piece of information students will need in long-term memory. She uses *Call and Response* to cause them to practice recalling this piece of information, to better encode it.

Her cue is a *group prompt*—“Tell me”—and she uses it to allow her to clearly identify moments when she'd like students to call and respond throughout her lessons. Her *Call and Response* moments are fairly infrequent. This is perhaps part of why they work with older students; she doesn't overuse them. But it also means that the cue has to be clearer. Mixing in the odd *Call and Response* with high school students helps students focus attention and remain actively engaged. It's a bit of novelty and so draws attention. Evolutionarily, what's new and unexpected gets attended to more closely because in our ancient history as a species, it could contain survival information. This phenomenon is known as “novelty bias” and it tells us that even if *Call and Response* itself is not the most substantive way to interact with classroom content, judiciously done—as a variation rather than a theme—it can help build attention. But it also explains why Sadie quickly transitions away from *Call and Response* after one or two interactions. The benefits from novelty bias erode quickly.

Here's something seemingly obvious that both Christine and Sadie have in common. Their students are repeating something important. In Christine's class it's the

---

<!-- Page 545 -->

vocabulary word she hopes to familiarize students with. In Sadie's class it's the freezing and boiling points of water.

This is important to note because *Call and Response* is one of those techniques that can have a bit of a catnip problem. It feels good to see your students engaged as a positive cohesive group. But this sense of momentary gratification also makes it easy to overuse the technique or to apply it in less optimal ways.

One interesting scene in Robert Pondiscio's outstanding *How the Other Half Learns*<sup>16</sup> involves Success Academy's CEO Eva Moskowitz observing a class with a group of school administrators.

Students are calculating the number of volleyballs in a group where the total number of balls is known, as well as the number of balls that are *not* volleyballs. The teacher calls on a child named Dmitri to discuss his work.

“The total is thirty-two,” he concludes.

“The total number of what?” she pushes.

“Um … of … the …”

“The total number of …?” she loudly signals to the class to answer.

“Balls!” some, but not all, students call out.

“The total number of …”

“Balls!” This time the whole class answers in unison, each child seeming determined to yell louder than the next.”

She goes back to the child who hesitated. “So, these thirty-two, Dmitri, are the total number of …”

The whole class again answers for Dmitri. “Balls!” they yell. It's deafening.

---

<!-- Page 546 -->

Moskowitz has seen enough and walks out. “You have an endemic problem with stupid shouting and call-and-response. Get them to a more intellectual place,” she tells [the principal] back in the hallway … “They know what a ball is. They’ve known what a ball is since they were toddlers.” Moskowitz is visibly irritated.

I agree with Moskowitz’s assessment. With any “technique” there is the risk of overuse or misapplication. You get a hammer and suddenly everything looks like a nail. Multiply that risk times ten for *Call and Response* because of its appeal to teachers. It feels good to get a vibrant and upbeat response. The temptation can be to use it again and again. Suddenly it’s a bit of a compulsion—overused with limited intentionality—that can easily devolve into poor execution. As with any technique you have to remain aware of the downside and answer the concerns that Moskowitz raises: For what purpose am I using it? What am I having students repeat and why? Am I overusing this technique?

## Call and Response with Reading

In a recent lesson, Eric Snider of Brooklyn was reading an article describing the characteristics of science fiction with his students. He began reading aloud with the expectation that his students would follow along, reading on their own at their seats. To help students feel motivated to follow along with him, he used a “Call and Response spot check.” “Some key facts to be mindful of,” he began, reading, “Most science fiction writers create believable …” The next word was “worlds,” but Eric didn’t read it. Instead he signaled to his students, most of whom chimed in “worlds!” This appeared to demonstrate that they were successfully following along. Eric, however, was concerned. “That was about 80 percent [of us],” he noted, walking to the overhead projector on which he was displaying the text.

---

<!-- Page 547 -->

“We are right here,” he continued, pointing to the place in the text where he was reading. He then began again. “Most science fiction writers create believable worlds with familiar elements,” he read, continuing past the point of the original spot check. “Science fiction often contains advanced …” Here he signaled again, whereupon all of his students chimed in: *“technologies!”* Having used *Call and Response* to gather data on who was reading along, and to reinforce their importance of reading along, he could now continue to read, knowing that students were more likely to be reading with him.

**TECHNIQUE 36: MEANS OF PARTICIPATION**

The video *Sadie McCreary: Means of Participation* shows Sadie's AP Chemistry class at Eastern Guilford HS in Greensboro, North Carolina. Sadie is sailing along through the kind of lesson every teacher would wish for. Her students are willing and active participants. They're focused and productive. The lesson feels positive, rigorous, and dynamic. There's no downtime.

First, Sadie outlines a series of questions for students to answer “out loud with a partner.” As she gives these directions the room crackles easily and naturally to life. Students chatter away, on task, without hesitation; everyone's participating. Coming out of the *Turn and Talk*, Sadie *Cold Calls* students warmly and inclusively to check their answers. These follow-up questions make sure the Think Ratio is high, too: “The Celsius temperature scale is based on what, Matthew?” she says.

Matthew is ready for her *Cold Call*, observing that the Celsius scale is based on the freezing point of water, and, with a gentle reminder, also its boiling point. Sadie

---

<!-- Page 548 -->

switches to *Call and Response* to reinforce the importance of freezing point and boiling point and her students seem to read her mind, responding crisply and in unison. She switches back to *Cold Call* to assess how well students have understood the Kelvin scale and yet again things run almost perfectly to plan—she's easily able to sample the room and involve any student. An eager hand-raiser in the front corner really wants to say his piece. Some teachers might need to rely on him to drive the conversation—his is the only hand up at the moment —but not Sadie. The eager hand-raiser waits patiently—and does not call out—as she *Cold Calls* a few more students and then asks for volunteers, which she gets easily. There's no awkward pleading for more or different students to raise their hands. When Sadie asks them to take notes, students update their tidy and organized notes seamlessly.

The lesson seems to gallop along and yet it seems relatively effortless for Sadie, standing there at the front of the room, smiling graciously.

Sadie's lesson is so successful because of her clarity about what to do when. For students in her class, there are a series of familiar routines for how content will be engaged and there is no ambiguity about which routine to use when. We call these routines for engagement the *Means of Participation*. Investing time in planning them and ensuring that which you’ll use when is clear to students makes you more likely to find yourself like Sadie: smiling in the midst of a class bursting with energy and productivity.

Routines are important. They “hack the attention economy in the classroom and help pupils learn hard things faster,” writes Peps Mccrea, and allow working memory to focus on the academic task rather than the process for doing that task, which has become familiar and habitual. On the 100th *Turn and Talk* when you say, “With your partner, how does

---

<!-- Page 549 -->

the structure of electron shells help us explain the behavior of the noble gases? Go,” students have almost their entire working memory focused on the question and almost none on an array of potential extraneous distractions: *Who am I supposed to talk to? Does she want to talk to me? Is everyone else going to do it? Should I be writing this down?*

Cues are always the first step in any routine. “A routine,” continues Mccrea, “is a sequence of actions triggered by a specific prompt or cue that is repeated so often it becomes an automatic [or nearly automatic] response.” The cue starts the chain of actions for any habit. So *Means of Participation* involves framing clear routines for each of the formats by which students participate in your class and then signaling quickly, reliably (and often subtly) to students which format you'd like them to use. The cue sets students up to engage confidently, correctly, and with minimal load on working memory. If students participate in less than optimal ways—calling out answers when we don't want them to or not answering when we hope they will—it's often because we haven't clearly communicated the *Means of Participation* for a given question. Considering student responses through this lens can also help us to assume the best (see [technique 59](#), *Positive Framing*). When students call out or engage in other behaviors we weren't expecting, considering whether our own framing of *Means of Participation* might have been unclear can be a helpful first step.

Watch again and you can see how intentional Sadie's cues are. Her “default”—the system of expectation for how to participate unless signaled otherwise—is that if she asks a question you raise your hand if you want to answer. There is always, also, the possibility of a *Cold Call*. This clarity about how to answer allows her to both take hand-raisers or *Cold Call* and to allow as much *Wait Time* as she likes. Students understand this because she has explained it to

---

<!-- Page 550 -->

them. Occasionally, when she is especially eager for hands, she communicates that to her students by saying “Hands!” or raising her own. When she wants *Call and Response*, she says, “Tell me” and students understand that signal. When she says “With your partners,” everyone knows a *Turn and Talk* is coming, and they know exactly how to engage their partner. Because Sadie has established these cues to make her *Means of Participation* clear, the room quickly comes to life whenever she asks a question.

In many classrooms, however, teachers ask students questions without signaling clearly in what format they should answer. When students have to wonder *Should I raise my hand? Can I call out? Was that question rhetorical? Should I write that down?* you get hesitation, confusion, and lack of follow-through instead of the crackling intellectual energy of Sadie's classroom. You get classrooms where teachers ask very good questions, but the same few students hesitantly call out answers again and again. Or classrooms where the teacher will ask a question and then after a few seconds of apparent impassivity from students, answer it herself. As I pointed out in the introduction to ratio, it doesn't matter how good the question is if only two or three students bother to answer it. *Means of Participation* is the signaling system by which you switch clearly and transparently among the formats in which students can answer, like *Cold Call*, taking volunteers, and *Turn and Talk* so everyone answers productively and confidently.

The word “default” here describes the basic rules of participation that are always in place in Sadie's classroom unless she signals otherwise. These are: raise your hand, don't call out, and know that I may ask you your opinion via *Cold Call*.

---

<!-- Page 551 -->

The first step in MOP, then, is the rollout where you explain the default (and perhaps some of the other systems you'll use for participation) and why. It should be brief but compelling. Better to just describe the default and add short descriptions of the other formats later rather than talk it to death on the first day!

Ironically one of the best models I have of a teacher doing this is not a classroom teacher but a soccer coach, James Beeston. The soccer field is not the classroom, but I submit that there's a lot for every educator to learn from how James rolls out his expectations in the video *James Beeston: Switched on at All Times*. I've transcribed what he says below:

> The main thing from tonight's session ... It's going to require intensity from both a physical and a mental standpoint. I'm going to be asking you questions throughout, to check for understanding. Don't shout out the answer. That's a big, important thing because I want you to think about the answers that you're giving. If you know the answer and I go like that [raises hand], raise your hand. If you don't know the answer, that's OK. We'll work through it; we'll problem-solve together. Sometimes I might call on you guys even if your hand isn't raised, OK?, because the game requires you to be switched on at all times, so I am going to be calling on guys at times to make sure the focus is still there, all right, so we're locked in from the first minute to the last minute.

This “rollout” takes James about 45 seconds. He explains what he's going to do (“Sometimes I might call on you guys even if your hand isn't raised”) and why (“... the game requires you to be switched on at all times”). He tells them what to do when he initiates a routine (“... don't call out; I want you to think about the answers”). He sets his

---

<!-- Page 552 -->

standards high but he also makes it safe to struggle (“We’ll work through it; we’ll problem-solve together”). And then he immediately begins practicing what he preaches so players understand that he means it because they start building the habit right away.

In fact a second video of James, *James Beeston: How Can We Use This?*, shows him questioning his players a bit later (after they’ve practiced for 20 minutes or so). From a ratio perspective—how many participants think about his questions, how much of the time, and how deeply—it would be hard to do much better.

Sadie had a very similar rollout on her first day to set up her default. Then she layered in new routines and their cues using a chart like the following one, which captures some of the common routines students use to participate in class, the cues a teacher might use to signal them and some other factors to consider.

| **MOP** | **Expectations** | **CUE** | **Notes** |
|---------|------------------|---------|---------|
| *Cold Call* (or Volunteers) | Raise your hand. I may call on hands or may *Cold Call*. | Default "I’ll ask some of you to share" or "Be ready, I may *Cold Call*" to increase predictability. | Explain to students that if you don’t signal anything else it means (1) raise your hand, (2) do not call out, (3) be ready for a *Cold Call*. |
| Volunteers (only) | I am looking to only call on volunteers, but I want lots of them. | "Hands!" "Your turn." Nonverbal: teacher raises hand as she asks. | Have a reminder ready if there are call outs (nonverbal or "Hands, please"). |

---

<!-- Page 553 -->

| MOP | Expectations | CUE | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Call and Response* | You'll call out the answer in unison and on cue. | "Tell me." Inflection at end of question. | Sometimes use a signal that you're done with *Call and Response* too, e.g. "Now: hands" or "Now: *Cold Call*." |
| *Turn and Talk* | You'll Turn and Talk to a designated partner. | "With your partner ..." "Turn and talk ..." | Note that BreOnna Tindall has both shoulder and face partners. Cue is: "Face/shoulder partner." |
| *Everybody Writes* | You'll put pencil to paper ... | "In your notes ..." "Stop and jot ..." "On your own ..." "Silent solo ..." | Have an "If you're stuck" starter ready. |
| *Other "Means of Participation" might include Show Call, White Boards, and Hand Signals.* | | | |

To establish this technique in your classroom, your might start by making a chart like the one above. Get specific as you plan about your expectations and cues. Finally, craft and practice your rollout. Read more about how to build a procedure into a routine in *technique 50*, *Routine Building*.

Once you've established the procedures, planning for your MOP can become part of your lesson preparation (see

---

<!-- Page 554 -->

**technique 3**, *Delivery Moves*). To maximize engagement and flow, you'll want to be intentional about varying approaches. We see Sadie do this in her chemistry lesson. *Cold Call* into *Turn and Talk*, then some volunteers and a bit of *Call and Response*. After that a bit of *Everybody Writes*.

When I spoke with Sadie, she shared this guidance about how she plans for MOP: “On my best days I plan for it in advance. If it's a meatier question then I always have students write or *Turn and Talk* first to increase participation, then I circulate while they are talking and warm call a few students [I call this technique “*pre-call*”]. If it's a question that is easy enough to ask out loud and I want to gather data in the moment by calling on specific students, then I *Cold Call* students who are typically high or medium or low to get a sense of whether they understand the concept. For something really simple that I want all students to quickly remind themselves of—choral response and we all say it aloud.”

# Frontloading

In a recent blog, London-based science teacher Adam Boxer shared an idea he called “frontloading” to get the most out of *Means of Participation*. His reflection started with the observation that even if you diligently communicate the desired *Means of Participation*, some students still may not hear it if it comes at the end of your directions. He gives this example:

*“What is the word equation for photosynthesis?  
Please write your answer on your mini-whiteboard  
and hold it face down until I ask you to show me.”*

“On the face of it, this is a good instruction. The question is clear and clear and the MOP is established in terms of how the students will write and present their answer,” Boxer writes, but he adds that you may still end up with students raising their boards before you have asked them. “The second you ask them the question, they start writing down their answer (or at least thinking about it) and they are no longer listening to you. It's not that they are being defiant or messing around, they just didn't take in the instruction. And again, it's not because the instruction isn't clear … it's a property of its placement.” He suggests frontloading—placing the *Means of Participation* at the beginning of the direction so that students hear it first and process it before they start thinking about the question.

*“OK, in a second I'm going to ask a question. Please write your answer on your mini-whiteboard and hold it face down until I ask you to show me. What is the word equation for photosynthesis?”*

If routines aren't firmly established, he suggests using a script more like this to build reliable follow-through:

---

<!-- Page 556 -->

“OK, I'm going to ask a question and you are going to one [hold up a finger], write your answer on a mini-whiteboard; two [hold up two fingers], keep it face down; and three [hold up three fingers], show me only when I say.”

You might even ask students to repeat that back to you if you're still getting routines built, Boxer suggests.17

Here are some of his examples of other frontloaded *Means of Participation* phrases:

- “By putting your hand up in the air, I'd like you to tell me ...”
- “Without calling out, can anyone tell me ...”
- “In silence, you are going to ...”
- “I'd wager ten quid that works better every time,” he notes.

# Online Lessons: *Means of Participation* Icons

The shift to remote teaching posed a unique set of challenges to teachers' working memory—challenges my team and I felt ourselves when we led trainings online. Like so many teachers, we often found ourselves using a presentation to structure our session. As we presented one slide we were often thinking of what the next slide covered, and trying to assess how our participants were responding to the session—reading their expressions, toggling over to the chat to field their questions or respond to their comments, prepping a breakout room. The new setting and the addition of technology resulted in working memory overload and it was shockingly easy to forget how we wanted participants to engage in the content of each slide. Even if we'd planned our *Means of Participation* we sometimes forgot to use what we'd planned at the right time and in the right way. Or we remembered but struggled to listen and respond as well as we could have. Our solution was to use icons to make our *Means of Participation* easy to remember so our working memory could be focused on participants.

We developed a set of icons that we placed at the bottom of our slides to remind us of the *Means of Participation* we'd planned:

---

<!-- Page 558 -->

- **Everybody Writes (Pen to Paper)**
- **Chat**
- **Turn and Talk (Breakout Rooms)**
- **Cold Call**

Suddenly we didn't have to strain to remember what participation moves we'd planned. With our working memory free we could listen far better to the discussion and think more deeply about the content. We shared this idea with several schools and watched them do remarkable things with it. Memphis Rise, a school in Memphis, Tennessee, for example, standardized the icons across the teaching staff and gave teachers a glossary of the terms and guidance on how to use them well. Here's a page from that document:

# MEMPHIS RISE ACADEMY

| Participation Method | Notes | Examples |
|----------------------|-------|----------|
| **4. Chat to All – Wait Question**<br>Wait | - Definition: Students type their responses into the chat to everyone and submit the responses on the teacher’s cue.<br>- Prior to Asking Questions: Make sure that chat setting is set to “everyone publicly” and that students are clear on the whether the question is a speed question or wait question. When giving directions, you should make sure that student have selected “To Everyone” in their chat menu.<br>- Uses for Speed Questions: Longer responses, responses that require more processing time, and data collection | - “For this question, I would like for you to prepare your response in the chat, but wait until I say ‘go’ to hit enter. We are going to give everyone a chance to get their thoughts together before we submit.”<br>- “Take two minutes to prepare your response in that chat. Wait to hit enter until I say go. Wow, nice work team. Take 1 minute to scroll back up and read the thoughts of your teammates.” |
| **5. Cold Call** | - Best Practices Mirror “In-Person” Instruction: Cold call should be positively framed and used as a frequent participation method in the class. Language around “cold call” should communicate an invitation to the discussion or to the class verbally.<br>- Reminding Students of the Zoom Operations: Especially early on in the school year, we should make sure that Cold Call questions include a prompt for students to “unmute” themselves.<br>- Uses for Cold Call: Operational questions, low-level CFU questions, constructing discussion based off of chat responses | - “Why did Scout respond that way? Take 15 seconds to think about it. Maria, please unmute yourself and start us off with your thoughts.”<br>- “Caleb, please pick up or “when he...” unmute yourself, continue reading.”<br>- “Rosa, you sent a beautiful response in that chat. Please unmute yourself and share it!”<br>- “Alex, please unmute yourself and build on that.” |
| **6. Hand Raise**<br>Raise Hand | - Execution Notes: Ask students to volunteer to respond to a question by raising their hand in the participants menu.<br>- Narrated Wait Time: Use the narrated wait time prior to selecting a student so that all students have a chance to develop their response and navigate to the participants menu to raise their hand. | - “Number 3 was a little bit tricky for all of us. I am looking for someone to raise their hand and walk us through their thought process for it. If you’re feeling confident, remember you can raise your hand by clicking participants and then ‘raise hand’.”<br>- “We have one minute to jot down our response. Raise your hand in the participants menu, if you want to start off our discussion. Okay, I got 2 hands already. How 3 of us really nice work team!” |
| **7. Show Me** | - Definition: Students share their responses visually on-screen.<br>- Hand Signals: Explain to students how to show their answer choices using their hands (1 for A, 2 for B, 3 for C, 4 for D)<br>- 2.0 – White Board: Have students write their answer to a problem or a question on a white board. On your cue, have students show their responses.<br>- Uses for Show Me: Note that “Show Me” is very similar, in terms of outcomes, to a wait question or a private chat question. Use Show Me when you want to collect data from the entire class in a quick and efficient way. | - “When I say go, I would like for you to show me a 1 if you chose A, a 2 if you chose B, a 3 if you chose C, and a 4 if you chose D. Take 20 seconds to choose your answer go. Go!”<br>- “I would like for you to write your answer big to fit on your whiteboard. When I say go, show me your response.” |

In the video *Madalyn McClelland: Maps*, you can see not only how Madalyn uses the icons to guide her own teaching but how to make participation transparent to students.

Interestingly, this is an idea that can also be productive in the classroom. One of my favorite schools in the UK, Torquay Academy in Torquay, has similarly developed a set of icons that they share with students. They also share the intent of the teaching techniques they represent so that when they see the “Wait Time” icon they know that the purpose is to think deeply and not rush, and so forth.^18

# TECHNIQUE 37: BREAK IT DOWN

---

<!-- Page 560 -->

*Break It Down* is a powerful teaching tool, but it can be challenging to use because it is primarily a reactive strategy. It's useful immediately after an incorrect or insufficient answer.

How to respond effectively and efficiently in those situations is one of teaching's ongoing challenges. We know that repeating the question a little slower or louder isn't likely to help, but what do you do instead?

With *Break It Down*, the goal is to ask a question or present a piece of new information that will help the student answer correctly and will still cause the student to do as much of the thinking as possible. In the simplest terms, you want to provide the smallest viable hint, helping the student activate what he or she *does* know to get the correct answer.

In the video *Narlene Pacheco: Keystone*, you can see an example that shows both Narlene's skill and the challenges of the technique. Her kindergarteners are segmenting words—“bat” in this case—but one of her students has the letters out of order. She has b-t-a. “Segment bat for me,” Narlene says, carefully managing her tell (see technique 12, *Culture of Error*). When her young scholar does this correctly, she points at her paper: “What did you write?” It's an ideal *Break It Down* since Narlene hasn't provided any new information. She's just asked her student to review her work with heightened attentiveness. If her scholar was able to get it right now it would be based entirely on a self-correction. But she does not yet see her mistake.

“Read what you have,” Narlene now says, her second effort to *Break It Down*, but again it's not enough so Narlene goes a step further. “What's the first sound? Do you have that?” she asks. Her tone is impeccable: supportive, without a hint of frustration or judgment. “What's the second sound?” she continues. “Tuh” her student replies. She's narrowing her

---

<!-- Page 561 -->

focus to a specific part of the work that's challenging. “What's the word?” Narlene now asks. “Buh-ah-tuh,” her student says and in so doing catches her error and fixes it. Narlene has helped her student solve while doing as much of the work as she can, and her students is happy: She’s figured it out rather than simply being told.

# Smallest Viable Hint

A teacher never really knows what knowledge a given student has, nor exactly how big the gap is between what the student knows and what he needs to know to succeed. Because the ideal is to cause a student to apply what he knows to the greatest degree possible, it’s useful to try to provide the smallest (successful) hint possible.

Providing a minimal hint gets at the tension in *Break It Down*. Whereas one goal is to break things down to the least degree possible, another is to do it quickly, thus managing time and pace. Meticulously adding a thin slice of knowledge to each previous hint would be the perfect means of causing students to do the greatest amount of cognitive work, but would derail instruction in a series of exercises that destroyed your pacing and led to rapid frustration on your students' part.

Sometimes, in the face of a wrong answer, you’ll have to move on to something else. So while your long-term goal is to maximize the cognitive work that students do, you’ll also have to balance those long-term goals with practical short-term realities. The good news is that the more you use *Break it Down*, the better (and faster) your students will get at their half of the equation.

# How *Break It Down* Works

When you ask a questions and the answer is not sufficient to be considered correct, your first goal is to get the

---

<!-- Page 562 -->

student to the correct answer. Your second goal is to keep your *Break It Down* rigorous by providing the smallest viable cue.

Take a look at the following figure. If you can provide a cue like A that makes the student fill in most of the gap, your student is likely to learn and remember more than if you use a cue like C. “Memory is the residue of thought,” Daniel Willingham tells us. There's more thinking to remember in A.

Both are more challenging than D, which solves the problem without any *Break It Down* (by giving the answer or having another student give the answer). Again, you want the smallest cue that will work in consideration of pacing, timing, rigor, and so on. A is desirable if you can, but you won't always be able to. You'll have to use D sometimes, too.

## Question: Where is the story set?

Desired answer: “In the northern part of Alaska near the Arctic Circle.”

Initial student answer: “The setting is in the North.”

- **A**: Roll back: “You said, ‘In the North.’”
- **B**: Narrow or eliminate false choices: “You said, ‘In the North.’ Where in the North? Are they speaking Russian?”
- **C**: Provide the first step: “Well, they’re on a journey, right? To take the ‘oblong box’ from one place to another. Where are they traveling from and to?”
- **D**: Responses that don’t *Break It Down*:  
  “The setting is in the northern part of Alaska near the Arctic Circle, Clara.”  
  “Can someone else tell us the setting?”

# Planning for **Break It Down**

One of the best ways to succeed with *Break It Down* is to prepare for it: with *Plan for Error* and *Exemplar Planning* (see *Chapter Two*), even if you don’t predict the precise error students make, over time you’ll get better at anticipating the kinds of things that students get wrong and the responses that help. You do an exercise like this, in other words, as part of a long-term investment in your own understanding.

As you plan to *Break It Down*—or even when you use the technique without planning—there are benefits to building your “range,” the types of prompts you’re comfortable using. We all tend to be creatures of habit; over time, our hints become predictable. Using a variety of ways to offer hints to students can help you connect with more kinds of thinkers, as well as provide a wider and more flexible array of help.

## Provide an Example

If you got a blank stare when you asked for the definition of a prime number, you might say, “Seven is one” or “Seven is one, and so is eleven.” If you wanted to *Break It Down* further, you could cue: “Seven is one, but eight is not.” You could then potentially take it a step further by observing, “Eight’s factors include two and four.” You can also provide additional examples if the question stumping the student was originally based on a category. For example, a student in Jaimie Brillante’s fifth-grade writing class struggled to identify the part of speech of the word *owner*. Jaimie cued: “Well, *owner* would logically be the same part of speech as other words that end in -er. *Dancer*, *swimmer*, *singer*. What are those?” she asked. “They’re people,” the student replied. Jaimie prompted, “And people have to be ...,” as the student chimed in, “Nouns!”

# Provide a Rule

In Christy Huelskamp's sixth-grade reading class at Williamsburg Collegiate in Brooklyn, a student guessed incorrectly that *indiscriminate* was a verb when used in the sentence, “James was an indiscriminate reader; he would pick up any book from the library and read it cover to cover.” Christy replied with a rule: “A verb is an action or a state of being. Is ‘indiscriminate’ an action?” The student quickly recognized that it was modifying a noun. “It’s an adjective,” she said.

# Provide the Missing (or First) Step

When a student in her fifth-grade math class was unable to explain what was wrong with writing the number fifteen-sixths, Kelli Ragain cued: “Well, what do we always do when the numerator is larger than the denominator?” Instantly the student caught on. “Oh, we need to make a mixed number. So I divide six into fifteen.”

# Roll-Back

Sometimes it’s sufficient to repeat a student’s answer back to him or her. Many of us instantly recognize our errors when they’re played back for us, as if on tape. You can see a great example of this in the video *Jessica Bracey: What You Said Is*.

Jessica is reading a novel called *Circle of Gold* with her fifth graders. She calls on a student, Gavin, to analyze the character Toni’s actions. His first answer is solid and he observes correctly that Toni is a sneaky character and that she is trying to trick Angel and Charlene into revealing their dishonesty, so Jessica follows up with another: “Why is that important?” Gavin does well here, too. It’s important because if Toni tricks them, she’ll reveal the truth about a stolen bracelet and defend her friend Mattie’s honor. Now

---

<!-- Page 565 -->

Jessica follows up again: “And what does that reveal about Toni as a friend?” This time however, Gavin gets stuck. He freezes and can't answer. To some degree this is inevitable … if we follow up good answers with further questions—be they *Stretch It* or *Right Is Right*—we are at some point going to get to the limits of what a student can answer at the moment. What then? How do we get the most out of them and foster success?

Jessica's response is simple and elegant. She uses a roll-back, simply repeating Gavin's words back to him: “So, Gavin, what you said is that Toni is sneaky and that she's a tricky person and that she's doing this because she is trying to get to the truth about who stole Angel's bracelet. Why is that important and what does that reveal about Toni as a friend?”

From there Gavin picks it up easily and closes out his analysis: this reveals that Toni is a helpful and good friend. She's trying to exonerate Mattie. He even uses the word “meticulous.”

It's a great moment. Instead of being “stuck” and not only possibly feeling like he'd failed, Gavin persists and does another layer of analysis. He closes it out with success, doing the cognitive work himself.

# A Couple of Finer Points

Notice Jessica's affect, which is neutral and emotionally constant as she re-asks the question. She's not annoyed with Gavin. There's no negativity in the roll-back but there's also no sticky-sweet to it, either. She knows he can get it. So she is steady at the helm.

She also avoids “tipping” (see *technique 32*, *Phrasing Fundamentals*). That is, she's careful not to give too much

away with her inflection. To understand how that might have happened, consider a roll-back in this situation:

You're studying the water cycle and you ask for an explanation of what happens to water vapor when it reaches the atmosphere. A student replies, “You get evaporation—water vapor forming droplets that become clouds.” This is wrong, of course. He has confused evaporation with condensation.

Saying “You said, ‘You get evaporation—water vapor forming droplets that become clouds,’ ” without discernible emphasis on any word makes your roll-back much more rigorous than if you said something like: “You said ‘You get *evaporation*—water vapor forming droplets that become clouds.’ ” Emphasis on the word “evaporation” points the student to the fact that it is the error and he can much more easily make the correction. So managing inflection as Jessica does in the video builds rigor.

To be fair, if your student still couldn't answer your evaporation question, your next move might be to add some emphasis, but you'd want to start with the least hint possible because you want your student to do as much of the analysis as he can.

Jessica then wraps it up with another nice move. She reinforces Gavin's work positively—“That was really strong thinking” and then asks for positive reinforcement from the class.

# Eliminate Choices

When Jaimie Brillante's student struggled to recognize that *owner* was a noun, Jaimie could have eliminated some false choices as follows: “Well, let's go through some of the options. If it were a verb, it would be an action. Can you or I owner? Well, what about an adjective? Is it telling me

what kind or how many of something?” Narlene also did this with her young scholar when she helped her to establish that her first sound had been segmented correctly.

# Fighting Rigor Collapse

Rigor collapse refers to what happens when you ask a hard question that students can't answer and progressively *Break It Down* until the big question is a question that now lacks the rigor of the original.

Scaling down the question gradually and cautiously so that students do as much of the cognitive work as possible is generally a good thing, but how do you achieve that without having a class consisting of simple, or even simplistic, questions?

In a lesson my team and I recently observed, a class was reading *The Outsiders*, and the teacher had asked students about the following exchange between Cherry, a “Soc” (that is, someone in a higher socioeconomic class) and Ponyboy, a “Greaser” (of a lower socioeconomic class):

> “You read a lot, don't you, Ponyboy?” Cherry asked.

> I was startled. “Yeah. Why?”

> She kind of shrugged. “I could just tell. I’ll bet you watch sunsets, too. I used to watch sunsets, before I got so busy. I miss it.”

The teacher asked what Cherry meant by “before I got so busy.” Cherry was the sort of person who was likely “busy” doing things like schoolwork and activities, the sorts of things on her side of the class divide, whereas Ponyboy was not. They could have been kindred spirits—watchers of sunsets—but class and caste expectations (at least partly) put them in different places.

---

<!-- Page 568 -->

The kids didn't get this. When asked, students postulated that the sorts of things Cherry was doing included “going shopping and hanging out with friends.” Because hanging out with friends was what Ponyboy would do, the teacher tried to break the complexity down a bit. “Can anyone connect this to the phrase ‘the rat race’?” (They had discussed earlier Ponyboy’s use of the term to disparage trying to succeed and cross the class divide.) Again students struggled to make the connection. So the teacher tried to break down the misunderstanding even further, hoping students would recognize the differences in how the two characters spent their time. Who was more likely to take music lessons? she asked. Cherry or Ponyboy? Why? Ponyboy didn't have parents to supervise him. If this was one sort of thing she might be doing when she was “busy,” what were some others?

The good news is that the teacher uncovered and addressed the fundamental misunderstanding among her class, but the result was also that a rigorous, metaphorical conversation with implications about socioeconomic class had been replaced by a literal one. The sequence ended with a small and narrow inference about who was more likely to take music lessons and never got back to implications about character or class: rigor collapse.

After winnowing questions, then, it’s often important to make broader sense of the answer students gave. Imagine, for example, if the teacher were to say something like, “Good; now connect that to one of the themes we’ve discussed from the book,” or “Good; now connect that to our discussion of class divide.”

If *Breaking It Down* takes a broad question and narrows it, a last move of connecting the narrow to a broader point is sometimes necessary.

# Notes

1. [https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/willingham_0.pdf](https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/willingham_0.pdf).

2. It's also worth noting that desirable difficulty assumes that students are successful in their thinking most of the time. We remember things better if we are able to answer, and less so, for the most part and for most of us it seems, if we cogitate on giant abstract questions of being and nothingness.

3. The term schema gets used vaguely and a bit recklessly —often in the classroom with very young students in a way-too-jargony way—so I tend to avoid it. I just refer to knowledge, which is really what it is: a lot of knowledge that is connected.

4. That is, if you know something you will begin to connect it to other things you are thinking and learning about and this will become a web of connections and facts. Arguably this is the difference between knowledge and information and expresses why schools should be intentional about how they present knowledge—they can shape the organizational structure as much as the amount of knowledge that students learn (see technique 5, *Knowledge Organizers*). Ironically, though, those who claim that schools teach isolated facts not only don't appear to have been in many schools recently but appear to be lacking in knowledge about how human cognition works. As a side note, I am pretty sure the phrase “even isolated facts don't stay that way for long” comes from something Daisy Christodoulou has written but I have been unable to find a citation. Still, this is a good opportunity to recommend her book *Seven Myths About Education*.

5. An interview with Paul Simon on the Dick Cavett Show ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFt0cP-klQI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFt0cP-klQI)) provides a good example. Simon is discussing how he wrote the song *Bridge Over Troubled Water*. He describes being stuck and suddenly thinking of a Bach *Chorale*, which he transposed and inserted into the song. (But only because knowledge of chorales and what they sounded like was in his long-term memory.) At a second point, Simon recalls, a gospel album that had been “constantly on my mind” because he had been playing it over and over “must have subconsciously influenced me because I started to go to gospel changes. …” To do this he had to encode the knowledge of how gospel sounded generally and what gospel “changes” sounded like in his long-term memory by playing the record over and over. And understanding the idea of typical chord change patterns (“changes”) itself relies of knowledge of musical theory; you have to know what “changes” are to listen for them. All of this caused insights to “come to him” suddenly while he was thinking about his own song. Inspiration and creativity relied on broad knowledge of Bach, gospel, and music theory. The insights were as much about the fusions of various schemes of knowledge as anything else.

6. Paul Simon, for example, would be extremely unlikely to think: I think I'll read up on Bach Chorales because just maybe they'd fit here in my song. He had to have the knowledge already to make the connection. The knowledge is what tells him what to “look up.”

7. See Willingham, especially. “Memory is the residue of thought, meaning that the more *you think about* something, the more likely it is that you'll remember it later.” Cognitive scientists like Willingham would argue that if you don't remember it, you haven't really learned

it, which is why memory and learning are closely related. https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/willingham_0.pdf.

8. If there's one thing my work life under pandemic has taught me, it's that I need the possibility of having to answer in order to stay fully engaged. Having seen this in a thousand Zoom calls, I recognize its echoes in face-to-face interactions.

9. Another way that planning questions in advance can help: You’re more likely to avoid asking a question for which, upon reflection, there is no clear answer.

10. Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff, *The Coddling of the American Mind* (Penguin Books, 2019), 29.

11. Elise J. Dallimore, Julie H. Hertenstein, and Marjorie B. Platt, “Impact of Cold-Calling on Student Voluntary Participation,” *Journal of Education Management*, 2012. The authors compared 16 sections of a single course with 600-plus total students in which half of the teachers used Cold Call and half did not.

12. Cold Call is a great example of the Band-Aid Paradox from the Preface to this book. Cold Calling involves some anxiety for a teacher. Will it go well? Will it be stressful for students? It is harder to figure out how to remove Band-Aids slowly that to justify ripping them off quickly. Some people will choose the latter. But you don't have to.

15. Also they can be cut short if students are not fully attentive in the lead-up to the *Call and Response*. A count of “One, two!” can occasionally be cut off by the teacher (“One …”) to indicate that the class is not ready while still maintaining the anticipation of the fun that's to come.

16. The book is a profound and challenging reflection on schools, parents, and choice for dozens of reasons. I highly recommend it for far more substantive reasons than a reflection on *Call and Response*.
