# Chapter 12  
## Building Student Motivation and Trust

This is a book about the tools teachers can use to build dynamic and inclusive classrooms that foster the greatest amount of learning and achievement possible and ensure that students thrive. But even seemingly successful methods, Adeyemi Stembridge reminds us, “can fall utterly flat” if they don’t find receptiveness among students.

This receptiveness is fostered via cultural and relational means. We must seek to make all students feel known and understood by their teacher, experience connection to the content, and trust in the endeavor of school. But there are psychological aspects, mindsets held internally by students that are critical factors in whether we (and they) succeed. Motivation is first among these. Learning requires effort, self-discipline, struggle, and perseverance; students will have to give and sustain effort and attention to succeed. They will have to decide, in short, that learning is worth working for.

It is hard to help a student achieve something they are not motivated to learn. For some students, motivation is a bright flame that merely has to be protected and fed with opportunity; for others it has scarcely (yet) been sparked. With some students we have to do everything we can to keep them in the game until they come to see the value of playing: They need, but do not yet want, what schools offer. The range of students we encounter is wide, but in almost every case, engendering and fostering the internal desire to learn is a part of the work of teaching, one in which we are always engaged, whether we realize that or not.

That's a key realization: we are always influencing motivation. The moment when we have a good long talk with students about effort and motivation may help, but less probably than the daily habits students fall into, the pervasive influence of what those around them do, and the compounded effect of a thousand small interactions we have with them when our minds are on something else.

One of the requirements of motivation—particularly for those students who begin with a skeptical attitude—is trust. Students have to come to believe in the endeavor of school and, as a result, be willing to try. I say that trust is a requirement but not a prerequisite of motivation because building trust can take time. It has to happen eventually for teaching to take hold. That does not mean it has to be there for you to start. Trust can take a long time—longer than you have before you start teaching. Happily, teaching well is one of the primary ways trust is built.

My colleague Dan Cotton framed for our team a model for how trust is built that continues to be meaningful for us. To feel trust, students have to feel safe, successful, and known.

Feeling *safe* means being physically safe—students can't feel at risk of being bullied or threatened—but also psychologically safe—it has to be OK to try, to be wrong, to take risks. There can never be snickers for trying and failing or, worse, for trying at all. As Zaretta Hammond writes, “Neuroscience tells us the brain feels safest and most relaxed when we are connected to others we trust to treat us well.” If we truly want our students to be prepared for the transformative experience of learning, then we must establish for them that the classroom is a place in which they belong and will be respected.

Feeling *known* refers to having a sense of belonging and importance. Students have to feel like their teacher—and

the institution—knows them and sees them as both a part of a community and as an individual—not just one of a group of students in third period or eighth grade. Of course that means they have to know that their identities and cultures are welcomed and valued, but in a much more everyday sense students have to feel seen, literally and figuratively—with the literal often causing the figurative. This is often expressed in small moments. Using student names, and inventing opportunities to greet students by name, is hugely important, for example. Saying someone's name is a small reminder of something larger: that we know them for themselves; that we see them in the crowd. One of the reasons I love it when teachers greet students as they enter the room is so they can say, “We missed you yesterday,” “I love your hair,” “Are those new glasses?” and, yes, “Make sure to get me your essay; it was due yesterday.” That, too, tells a student they matter. But Denarius Frazier (see *Denarius Frazier: Remainder*) is also making students feel known when he circulates in his math class and sees their work and the products of their minds. “Much better,” he tells one student. The message is: “I saw what you did today and how it was different from what you did yesterday.”

*Successful* is perhaps the easiest of the three elements to overlook, though its role in motivation is larger than most people realize. Motivation, Peps Mccrea explains,1 is “as much a product of learning as it is the driver of it… . If we care about building motivation for the long run, we must prioritize proficiency. It is the ultimate self-fulfilling engine of education.”

Accomplishing a task successfully and learning that they can succeed leads students to want more. That's why effective teaching that leads to student mastery is one of the greatest long-term sources of student motivation and trust. Part of why Christine Torres's students love and trust

her and work so hard throughout each lesson is her skill as a teacher. Every day they enter a place that’s orderly and productive and see themselves learning and accomplishing things. They feel capable and accomplished and, naturally, like that feeling. Peps Mccrea calls this “scholarly identity” and it often comes from the outside in. They see themselves doing well at English and conclude they must like and value English.

But motivation is shaped most of all by norms. That’s the hidden secret. It’s the most important factor and it’s mostly invisible to us. People are evolved to be supremely social—think here of the “cooperative eye” hypothesis—and will be inclined to do what the group is doing even without realizing it. “Norms are so powerful they override more formal school policies or rules. However, their largely invisible and unconscious nature makes them easy to underestimate if not totally ignore,” writes Mccrea. Norms will emerge, in any setting where there are people, and they will shape behavior. It is merely a question of whether they are deliberate or accidental norms. In many schools it is the latter.

The strength of a norm’s influence over us, however, also depends on how much we feel a part of and identify with those exhibiting the norms. Motivation is mediated by belonging.

What I focus on in this chapter is how to make students feel belonging, trust, and motivation, so that teachers find a receptive audience for learning. Put another way, this chapter describes rules of thumb for the daily interactions with students in which motivation and trust are built.

# TECHNIQUE 59: POSITIVE FRAMING

---

<!-- Page 819 -->

People are motivated by the positive far more than by the negative. Seeking success and happiness will spur stronger action than seeking to avoid punishment. “When we are happy—when our mindset and mood are positive—we are smarter, more motivated, and thus more successful. Happiness is the center, and success revolves around it,” concludes Shawn Achor, summarizing years of studying happiness. Positivity inspires and motivates and that should influence the way we teach. But positivity, particularly in learning settings, is often misunderstood.

One flaw is the assumption that praise is the same thing as positivity. *Praise* is telling someone they have done something well. *Positivity* (in this case) is the delivery of information students need in a manner that motivates, inspires, and communicates our belief in their capacity. This is important because teachers are often told to use a “praise sandwich” or to praise five times as often as they criticize. But telling someone they're doing great several times so that you can then say *And you have to line up your decimals consistently* is problematic.

Believing that you must wrap criticism with praise assumes that students are fragile and can't take constructive feedback—that criticism is something a teacher has to trick them into hearing. Most students want to understand how to get better and come to trust adults who tell them the truth when they also know that those adults believe in them.

Inaccurate or unwarranted praise “is unlikely to stand for long in the face of contrary experience,” writes Peps Mccrea. “Promises of success that don't eventually materialize will only serve to undermine motivation and erode trust.”

We all know the teacher who's inclined to describe every idea, every answer, every action as “awesome.” Soon

---

<!-- Page 820 -->

enough that word and his praise more generally become less meaningful. When everything is awesome, nothing is.

Which isn't to say praise isn't profoundly important and motivating. It is. But that's all the more reason to preserve its value.

So the key is often not to praise more. Rather, aspire to give a range of useful and honest feedback and guidance that includes both praise and critical or corrective feedback, but do so positively, *in a manner that motivates, inspires, and communicates our belief in our students' capacity*.

Using *Positive Framing* allows you to give all kinds of feedback, as required by the situation, while keeping culture strong and students motivated. Doubly so for redirections—moments when we say to a student, “Do that differently.” If those moments remind the person you're talking to that you want them to be successful and that you believe in and trust their intentions, students will trust you more and be motivated to follow your guidance.

*Positive Framing*, then, is the technique of framing interactions—particularly academic or behavioral redirections—so that they reinforce a larger picture of faith and trust, even while you remind students of a better course of action.

Next are six rules of thumb to follow. As you read about them, be sure to check out the classroom examples in the video Montage: *Positive Framing*.

## Assume the Best

One of the most pervasive tendencies in human psychology is the *Fundamental Attribution Error*—the idea that, when in doubt, we tend to attribute another person's actions to

---

<!-- Page 821 -->

their character or personality rather than to the situation. We often assume intentionality behind a mistake.

You can hear this in classrooms where a teacher's words imply that a student did something wrong deliberately when in fact there is little ground to assume that.

“Stop trying to disrupt class!” “Why won't you use the feedback I gave you on your first draft?” or “Just a minute, class; some people seem to think they don't have to push in their chairs when we line up.” Such statements attribute ill intention to what could be the result of distraction, lack of practice, or genuine misunderstanding. What if the student had tried to incorporate your feedback, or just plain forgot about the chair? How might hearing statements like these make a confused or flustered student feel? Unless you have clear evidence that a behavior was intentional, it's better to assume that your students have tried (and will try) to do as you've asked.

This mindset also helps us as teachers maintain our emotional constancy and equilibrium. Rather than feeling flustered or defensive—*Why won't he follow my directions? Is she trying to get under my skin? How many times have I said this?*—assuming the best helps us model calm assurance. This in turn builds trust—students know we will give them the benefit of the doubt and support them through confusion or struggles without jumping to conclusions or taking their actions too personally.

One of the most useful words for assuming the best is *forgot*, as in, “Just a minute; a couple of us seem to have forgotten to push in their chairs. Let's try that again.” Given the benefit of the doubt, your scholars can focus their energy on doing the task right instead of feeling defensive.

---

<!-- Page 822 -->

Further, this approach shows your students that you assume they want to do well and believe they can—it’s just a matter of nailing down some details.

*Confused* is another good assume-the-best word, as in, “Just a minute; some people appear to be confused about the directions, so let me give them again.” Another approach is to assume that the error is your own: “Just a minute, class; I must not have been clear: I want you to find every verb in the paragraph working silently on your own. Do that now.” This last one is especially useful. It draws students’ attention more directly to your belief that only your own lack of clarity would mean lack of instant follow-through by your focused and diligent charges. And, of course, it also forces you to contemplate that, in fact, you may not have been all that clear.

It is important to note that these phrases will not likely work—nor will this approach—if you do not actually believe the best about the students in front of you. As Adeyemi Stembridge writes, “Authenticity is a must for our students. One of their assets is that they can spot frauds at great distances.” If you are doubtful about student confusion, or worse, if you deliver this observation in a sarcastic tone, then you may actually damage the very relationships that you intend to build up.

Another nice way to assume the best is to see minor struggles as the result of misdirected enthusiasm. When you think this way, you suggest that there was a positive intention for a behavior that merely went awry. In a behavioral situation, this might sound like, “Gentlemen, I appreciate your enthusiasm to get to math class, but we need to walk to the door. Let me see you go back and do it the right way.” In an academic setting, it might sound like, “I appreciate that you are trying to build complex and

---

<!-- Page 823 -->

expressive sentences, but this one might have a little too much in it for clarity.”

Assuming the best is especially effective for errors on challenging academic work. Learning is full of mistakes done for good reasons. There are those that spring from an overabundance of diligence—“You told me to use transition words so I used far too many”—and those rooted in too much enthusiasm—“I've just learned to reduce fractions and now I want to reduce and reduce and reduce everything … even when I can't.”

Assuming the best might give credit for a good idea and then offer the correction: “I like that you're looking to reduce. But we can't do that here.” Or “I love to see you trying to use those transition words but there are so many they've gotten a bit confusing.” Looking for the good intention behind the mistake, looking to assume the best, has the additional benefit of causing *you* to think about all the good reasons why students might have done something that at first looks egregious. Assuming well-intentioned errors can help you to see more of the positivity that already exists.

It's important to remember that you, too, participate in setting the norms of your classroom by describing what you expect. Assuming the best reinforces positive norms (and expresses a quiet confidence). It suggests that you struggle to imagine a universe in which students would not be productive, considerate, and scholarly because of your faith both in them and in the culture of your own classroom. You implicitly describe the norm you believe to be there—everyone making a good faith effort. If by contrast you were to assume the worst, you would be suggesting that sloppiness, inconsiderateness, and whatever else were what you yourself expected in your classroom.

---

<!-- Page 824 -->

Of course, you'll want to be careful not to overuse the assume-the-best approach. If a student is clearly struggling—refusing to follow a clearly delivered instruction and is signaling to you that they are in an agitated, emotional state—don't pretend. In such cases, addressing the behavior directly with something more substantive, such as a private individual correction, also helps to get the student back into a productive mode without the attention of the rest of the class.

Even in the most challenging cases, however—say a student has done something really negative like stealing or belittling a classmate—be careful to let your words judge a specific behavior (“That was dishonest”) rather than a person (“You are dishonest”). Perhaps even say, “That was dishonest, but I know that's not who you are.” A person is always more and better than the moments in which he or she errs, and our language choices give us the opportunity to show in those moments that we still see the best in the people around us.

# Live in the Now

In most cases—during class and while your lesson is underway, for example—avoid talking about what went wrong and what students can no longer fix. Talk about what should happen next. Describing what's no longer within your control is negative and demotivating. There's a time and place for processing what went wrong, but the right time is not when your lesson hangs in the balance or when action is required.

When you have to give constructive feedback, start by giving instructions that describe as specifically as possible the next move on the path to success (see *technique 52*, What to Do).

<!-- Page 825 -->

If David is whispering to his neighbor instead of taking notes, say, “I need to see you taking notes, David,” or, better, because it is more specific, “I should see your pencil moving,” rather than, “Stop talking, David,” or “I've told you before to take notes, David.”

In the previous chapter we saw Emily Bisso use this to great effect: “Write what I write, Joshua.”

Again, the clearer you can be about the next step, the better. As Chip and Dan Heath point out in *Switch*, “what looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity.” So provide clarity without judgment. If you deliver the directions in a neutral tone, with no frustration evident in your voice, you may be surprised by how helpful it is. Most students want to succeed; by providing them with a clear next step you are helping both of you to get closer to your shared goal.

One challenge here is that we often are too vague in our instructions. When in doubt, shrink the change—a phrase that also comes from the Heath brothers. “One way to motivate action, then, is to make people feel as though they're already closer to the finish line than they might have thought.” Name a small first step that feels doable. So, “Please start taking notes, David,” becomes “Pencil in hand, please.” It's much easier for a potentially reluctant or confused student to engage in a task that is bite-size than one that might feel more overwhelming.

For what it's worth, this is part of the coaching philosophy of the famously positive and successful football coach Pete Carroll, one of the game's best motivators. “We're really disciplined as coaches to always talk about what we want to see,” he says of his entire coaching staff's approach. They always strive to focus on “the desired outcome, not about what went wrong or what the mistake was. We have to be disciplined and always use our language to talk about

---

<!-- Page 826 -->

the next thing you can do right. It's always about what we want to happen, not about the other stuff.”²

# Allow Plausible Anonymity

You can often allow students the opportunity to strive to reach your expectations in plausible anonymity as long as they are making a good-faith effort. This would mean, as I discuss in *Chapter Eleven*, beginning by correcting them without using their names when possible. If a few students are not yet completely ready to move on with the activities of the class, consider making your first correction something like “Check yourself to make sure you've followed the directions.” In most cases, this will yield results faster than calling out individual students by name. It doesn't feel good to hear your teacher say, “Evan, put down the pencil,” if you knew you were about to do just that. Saying to your class, “Wait a minute, Morehouse (or “Tigers” or “fifth grade” or just “guys”), I hear a few voices still talking. I need to see you quiet and ready to go!” is better than lecturing the talkers in front of the class. This plausible anonymity is another way of communicating to students that you believe the best about their intentions and are certain they are just seconds away from being fully ready to move forward with the tasks necessary to learn.

# Narrate the Positive and Build Momentum

Compare the statements two teachers recently made in their respective classrooms:

*Teacher 1: (pausing after giving a direction)* Monique and Emily are there. I see rows three and four are fully prepared. Just need three people. Thank you for fixing that, David. Ah, now we're there, so let's get started.

---

<!-- Page 827 -->

Teacher 2: (same setting) I need two people paying attention at this table. Some people don't appear to be listening. This table also has some students who are not paying attention to my directions. I'll wait, gentlemen, and if I have to give consequences, I will.

In the first teacher's classroom, things appear to be moving in the right direction because the teacher narrates the evidence of student follow-through, of students doing as they're asked, of things getting done. He calls his students' attention to this fact, thereby normalizing it. He doesn't praise when students do what he asks, but merely acknowledges or describes. He wants them to know he sees it, but he also doesn't want to confuse doing what's expected with doing *great*. If I am sitting in this classroom and seek, as most students do, to be normal, I now sense the normality of positive, on-task behavior and will likely choose to do the same.

The second teacher is telling a different story. Things are going poorly and getting worse. He's doing his best to call our attention to the normality of his being ignored and the fact that this generally occurs without consequence. The second teacher is helping students to see negative norms as they develop and, in broadcasting his anxieties, making them even more visible and prominent as well. In a sense he's creating a self-fulfilling prophecy: he narrates negative behavior into being.

“To modify motivation,” writes Peps Mccrea, “change what … pupils see.” If teachers make *desirable norms* (people doing positive things) more visible to students they will be more likely to join with them. Mccrea calls this *elevating visibility*. To elevate visibility of a norm you want more people to follow, increase their *profusion*—the proportion of students who appear to follow them—and their *prominence*—how much you notice when people do it.

---

<!-- Page 828 -->

The first teacher is helping students to see more readily how profuse positive and constructive behavior is, and he is making it more prominent to students by letting them know that he sees and that it matters.

Narrating the positive, though useful, is also extremely vulnerable to misapplication, so here are a couple of key rules:

- Use *Narrate the Positive* as a tool to motivate group behavior as students are deciding whether to work to meet expectations, not as a way to correct individual students after they clearly have not met expectations.

- If you narrate positive on-task behavior *during* a countdown you are describing behavior that has exceeded expectations. You gave students ten seconds to get their binders out and be ready to take notes, but Jabari is ready at five seconds. It's fine to call that out. It's very different to call out Jabari for having his binder out after your countdown has ended. At that point it might seem as though you are using Jabari's readiness to plead with others who have not followed through in the time you allotted.

Another common misapplication would be this: You're ready to discuss *Tuck Everlasting*, but Susan is off task, giggling and trying to get Martina's attention. You would not be using positive framing or narrating the positive effectively if you circum-narrated a "praise circle" around Susan: "I see Danni is ready to go. And Elisa. Alexis has her book out." In this case, I recommend that you address Susan directly but positively: "Susan, show me your best, with your notebook out. We've got lots to do." If you use the praise circle, students will be pretty aware of what you're doing and are likely to see your positive reinforcement as contrived and disingenuous. And they're likely to think

---

<!-- Page 829 -->

you're afraid to just address Susan. In fact, Susan may think that as well. By directly reminding Susan what is expected—and why—you have helped her get ready to engage with the learning and maintained the norm of readiness that is shared by the class.

# Challenge!

Students love to be challenged, to prove they can do things, to compete, to win. So challenge them: exhort them to prove what they can do by building competition into the day. Students can be challenged as individuals or, usually better, as groups, and those groups can compete in various ways:

- Against other groups within the class (e.g. rows, tables)
- Against other groups outside the class (another homeroom)
- Against an impersonal foe (the clock; the test, to prove they're better than it is; their age—“That was acceptable work for seventh graders, but I want to see if we can kick it up to eighth-grade quality.”)
- Against an abstract standard (“I want to see whether you guys have what it takes!”)

Here are some examples to get you started. I'm sure you'll find it fun to think of more:

“You guys have been doing a great job this week. Let's see if you can take it up a notch.”

“I love the work I'm seeing. I wonder what happens when we add in another factor.”

“Let's see if we can write for ten minutes straight without stopping. Ready?!”

---

<!-- Page 830 -->

“Ms. Austin said she didn't think you guys could knock out your math tables faster than her class. Let's show 'em what we've got.”

## Talk Expectations and Aspirations

When you ask students to do something differently or better, you are helping them become the people they wish to be or to achieve enough to have their choice of dreams. You can use the moments where you ask for better work to remind them of this. When you ask your students to revise their thesis paragraphs, tell them you want them to write as though “you're in college already” or that “with one more draft, you'll be on your way to college.” If your students are fourth graders, ask them to try to look as sharp as the fifth graders. Or tell them you want to do one more draft of their work and have them “really use the words of a scientist [or historian, and so on] this time around.” Tell them you want them to listen to each other like Supreme Court Justices. Although it's nice that you're proud of them (and it's certainly wonderful to tell them that), the goal in the end is not for them to please you but for them to leave you behind on a long journey toward a more distant and more important goal. It's useful if your framing connects them to that goal.

## TECHNIQUE 60: PRECISE PRAISE

Whereas *Positive Framing* focuses on how you make constructive or critical feedback feel motivating, caring, and purposeful to the recipient, *Precise Praise* is about managing positive feedback to maximize its focus, benefit, and credibility. Although it might seem like the simplest thing in the world, positive reinforcement helps students more if it's intentional, and you must constantly defend against the potential for it to become empty or

---

<!-- Page 831 -->

disingenuous, especially through overuse. When we overly rely on “excellent” and “awesome” to stamp every interaction we have with a child—what I sometimes call the state of “awesome awesomeness”—we eliminate our ability to truly and genuinely celebrate the accomplishments that are indeed *excellent* and *awesome* when they really do occur.

## Reinforce Actions, Not Traits

Positive reinforcement is a response to an action that has just occurred: a student does something well, and you tell her she's done a nice job. At its best, positive reinforcement is also about the future. You don't just want a student to feel good about having done something correctly, you want to help her understand how to succeed again the next time. Even more deeply, you want to reinforce a way of thinking about learning that embraces struggle and adversity—relishes it even. Carol Dweck's seminal research on this topic, discussed in her book *Mindset*, has shown that in the long run, people who have a growth mindset far outpace those with a fixed mindset. Her research suggests that the difference is one of the strongest predictors of success. People with a fixed mindset see intelligence and skill as something static. You're smart, or you're not. You're good at something, or you're not. People with a growth mindset see intelligence and skill as something you develop. You work hard, and you get better. Smart isn't what you are; it's what you do. Individuals with a fixed mindset see a challenge and think, “Oh, no. This is going to be difficult.” Individuals with a growth mindset see a challenge and think, “Oh, boy. This is going to be difficult.”

Dweck finds that praise is central to the development of growth mindset. If students are praised for traits (“You're smart”), they become risk averse: they worry that if they fail, they won't be smart anymore. If students are praised

---

<!-- Page 832 -->

for actions (“You worked hard, and look!”), they become risk tolerant because they understand that the things within their control—their actions—determine results. It’s critical then to praise actions, not traits, and further to carefully identify actions that students can replicate. You are praising them in part to help them see the inside of the success machine: the more actionable the thing you reinforce, the more students can replicate their success. “Go back and look at your draft, Maria. See those cross-outs and rewrites? That’s why your final draft is so strong.” You can see this in the video *Steve Chiger: Kudos*, of North Star Academy English teacher Steve Chiger. At first Steve walks up to a student and tells her she’s done well. We pause the video here to let you reflect: What’s her takeaway? What does she conclude about her success? She knows Mr. Chiger thinks she did something great, but not what and why. Not how to do it again. Perhaps his praise made her feel good, but with so many questions maybe it doesn’t quite feel genuine.

But then it’s as if Steve recognizes this. He doubles back and answers all of those questions. The student realizes I was sharp in class because I prepped well and read carefully and made notes. I can do that again.

Suddenly the praise has taken on a whole new role. She can see the road map that was hidden before. He has helped her to see what has caused her success and what to keep doing.

## Offer Objective-Aligned Praise

I have a secret life working with coaches of sports franchises. (If you want to know more about it, you can check out my book *The Coach’s Guide to Teaching*.) In that world, one of my favorite videos to show is of all-world

---

<!-- Page 833 -->

basketball player Steph Curry getting feedback from all-world basketball coach Steve Kerr.

The interaction (you can watch it here: https://www.coachsguidetoteaching.com/; scroll down through about 12 videos) takes place on the bench as Kerr shows Curry a set of data about his performance in the game so far. Uncharacteristically, Curry is having a rough night—or at least a less-brilliant-than-usual night.

But Kerr wants Curry to be aware of the things he is doing right, so he will persist in doing them. In the long run, they will cause Curry and the team to succeed. One of the most important things a coach can do is to help players attend to the signal (what's important to success) and not the noise (all the other things that distract us from what's important). What are the actions that will cause me to be successful over the long run, regardless of the outcome of this single moment?

That's what Kerr does in the video. He's helping Curry—yes, even Steph Curry—see the signal: when he is on the floor and plays up-tempo, great things that he is not fully aware of are happening and will continue to happen. The goal of the praise is not to make Curry feel better and build his confidence—Curry has plenty of that. The goal is to help him know what to replicate. That is in many ways the greatest power of praise.

One of the keys to helping students succeed is giving them **accurate attributions**, to “regularly point out the causes of pupil success and failure [and] help them see how effort and approach make a difference,” in Mccrea's words. Kerr is helping Curry make an accurate attribution. Play up-tempo—replicate what you are doing in that aspect of your game—and you will succeed. As indeed Curry did, being crowned NBA champion later that year.

Of course, praising (or positively reinforcing) actions means calling out things like hard work and diligence, but some of the best teachers I've observed align their praise to learning objectives. Suppose students are working on including strong transitions in their writing. As you *Circulate* (technique 25) and observe, you specifically reinforce those who have used transitions or, better, those who have gone back and added to or revised their transitions to make them better. Perhaps you even use a *Show Call* (technique 13) to show off their work. “Scholars, look up here. This is Melanie’s paper. Look at this paragraph. She included a solid transition, but then she went back and revised it to make it capture the contrast between the paragraphs more clearly. Now her paper really holds together. That’s how you do it.” Now, not only does Melanie know what was behind her success, not only does she understand that success is determined directly by her own actions, but the rest of the class sees it, too.

Another benefit of *Precise Praise* connects back to what Shawn Anchor calls the *Tetris Effect*. Essentially, by training our brains to look for and appreciate the positive, we learn to see things more positively overall. Anchor writes, “Just as it takes days of concentrated practice to master a video game, training your brain to notice more opportunities takes practice focusing on the positive.” By using *Precise Praise* to help students notice all that they are doing that is right or exceptional, we are also training them to see the learning community as a positive place. We are also, of course, training ourselves to see the same. Imagine the effect that this habit has on the struggling first-year teacher, in the classroom where everything may not be exactly as she or he had hoped. By training herself to precisely name that which is going well, she not only makes that behavior more replicable for students, but lets herself celebrate that which is worthy—and hopefully avoids the

doom loop of narration that can overwhelm so many well-intended, early-career teachers.

# Differentiate Acknowledgment from Praise

Acknowledgment is what you often use when a student meets your expectations. Praise is what you use when a student exceeds expectations. An acknowledgment merely describes a productive behavior or perhaps thanks a student for doing it, without adding a value judgment and with a modulated tone. Praise adds judgment words like “great” or “fantastic” or the kind of enthusiastic tone that implies that such words might apply. “Thanks for that comment, Marcus” is an acknowledgment; “Fantastic insight, Marcus” is praise. “Marcus is ready” is acknowledgment; “Great job, Marcus” is praise.

Distinguishing the two is important, as reversing some of the examples will demonstrate. If I tell Marcus it's fantastic that he's ready for class, I suggest that this is more than I expect from my students. Ironically, in praising this behavior I tell my students that my standards are pretty low and that perhaps I am a bit surprised that Marcus met my expectations. Perhaps they aren't expectations after all. Either way, praising students for merely meeting expectations may reduce the degree to which they do so over the long run. It also makes your praise seem “cheap.” If that happens, it also means that when Marcus writes a powerful response to a piece of literature and you call it “fantastic,” you will be describing it in a manner on par with how you described coming to class on time, and this may perversely diminish the accomplishment in his eyes. In the long run, a teacher who continually praises what's expected risks trivializing both the praise and the things she really wishes to label “great,” eroding the ability to give meaningful verbal rewards and to identify behavior that is truly worthy of notice. In short, save your praise for

when it is truly earned and use acknowledgment freely to reinforce expectations.

It's important to add that, as with any technique, it is essential here that you deeply know your students. There may be students for whom completing a homework assignment is, in fact, extraordinary. When that is the case, a more private moment in which you praise and appreciate the effort it may have taken for that student to set themselves up for success and to establish a new and better habit is more than warranted, it is desirable. What you want to avoid is public praise for a behavior that, for most students, is not out of the ordinary at all.

## Modulate and Vary Your Delivery

Because teachers most often give reinforcement, positive and negative, in a public setting (that is, in a room with twenty-five other people in it), it's critical to be attentive to the degree to which a statement engages others in the room: Is it loud or quiet, public or private? Do others overhear it?

Generally, privacy is beneficial with critical feedback. As I discuss in [Chapter Eleven](#), whispered or nonverbal reminders assume the best about students: they allow them to self-correct without being called out in public. The private individual correction discussed in [technique 55](#), *Least Invasive Intervention*, is a classic example of this. But what about the reverse? Should praise therefore be loud? Turns out it's not quite that simple. Positive reinforcement works best when it is genuine and memorable. To make it memorable, you'll want it to stand out a bit, keeping its format a bit unpredictable.

A bit of public praise can be powerful—you stop the class to read Shanice's sentence aloud and say to the class, “Now that is how a strong, active verb can give muscle to a

---

<!-- Page 837 -->

sentence!” People can't replicate it if they don't know about it, so that's one clear benefit to public praise. In addition, the fact that you thought Shanice's work was so good that everybody should hear will make your words memorable to her—but they will stand out more if *all* praise isn't public. Part of what's powerful about the public delivery is that it's a bit unexpected, so it can also be powerful to walk up to Shanice and whisper, “Now that is a strong, active verb. It sounds like you wrote this for a college paper.” In fact, you capture the greatest benefit by delivering positive reinforcement using an unpredictable variety of settings and volumes.

Among the benefits of private praise is that it often sounds especially genuine to the listener because, implicitly, it *is* private and therefore only about her, as opposed to public praise, which is also about those who hear it and your desire for them to observe and possibly replicate what the student you're praising has done. The power of pulling Shanice aside as she enters the classroom and saying, “I just wanted to tell you that I graded the exams last night, and yours was really outstanding,” may be equal to or even greater than your public recognition of her work. When a teacher takes a moment to speak to a student privately, she intimates that what she is going to say to that student is very, very important, and this raises a question: What could be so important? To find that it is a response to your excellent work is both powerful and unexpected for a student.

One further benefit of private praise is that it creates uncertainty and additional privacy around all private interactions, and this is immensely productive. If all of my private and quiet conversations with students were critical (that is, they were all private individual corrections), students might become defensive upon my approach. Further, other students might be motivated to eavesdrop,

---

<!-- Page 838 -->

knowing that listening in might provide them with the juicy details of a classmate's misfortune. Most people can't help but be curious about such things. If, however, my approaching or leaning down to speak quietly with a student is just as likely to be an example of private individual precise praise (PIPP, also discussed in Chapter Eleven), then students will consider the approach with balanced equanimity, and their classmates will have no incentive to eavesdrop. Either message is thus heard more openly by the intended recipient and ignored by those for whom it's not intended.

That said, there are also benefits to loud praise and praise that's semiprivate—that is, deliberately intended to be overheard by others. Praise always walks the line between the benefit of allowing others to overhear what's praiseworthy and thus encouraging them to seek to emulate it, and the benefit of the genuine sincerity of its just being about the recipient. In terms of how to balance these benefits, my sense is that both are more powerful if they aren't entirely predictable and that although socializing and influencing others through praise are beneficial, they're less critical than the long-term benefit of maintaining the credibility and genuineness of praise. I would skew toward privacy a bit more for the most substantive feedback to a student.

# TECHNIQUE 61: WARM/STRICT

In *Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain*, Zaretta Hammond describes the critical importance of teachers who are what she calls “warm demanders”: those who combine personal warmth with high expectations and “active demandingness,” which, she writes, “isn't defined as just a no-nonsense firmness with regard to behavior but an insistence on excellence and academic effort.”

---

<!-- Page 839 -->

But warm demanders can be rare because so many people perceive high expectations, firmness, and relentlessness about academic content and firm discipline to be something you do, not because you love young people, but because, somehow, you don't. You are one or the other: caring or demanding. They are opposites. But of course this is an illusion. The magic lies in the correlation, in fact, in being the person who can be both at the same time, who can say *I believe in you and I care about you and therefore I will not accept anything but your best. You must rewrite the paragraph, complete the homework, apologize to a peer you have wronged—because you are worthy of as much*.

To do that is to push a student to be their very best.

You can get a glimpse of how those two apparently contradictory ideas live in harmony in watching a video we also saw in Chapter 11: Trona Cenac: *Register Shifts*. The video is shot on one of the first days of school and Trona is in the hallway, setting norms and expectations before students come into class. You can sense right away how glad she is to see her students and how glad they are to see her. She's warm, gracious, and caring—full of smiles and reassurance. But she's also really clear about what's expected of them and what they need to do to be successful. They need to come in, take a seat, and get started on their work with urgency. There's work to be done. It's not optional. Within this single interaction she tells students she cares about them and expects a lot from them—essentially at the same time.

A teacher like Trona includes the *come in, take a seat, get started right away* part because she cares deeply about her students. Being willing to do so is part of what adults who care for and about young people do. Certainly it would be easier for her not to shift into the *we have work to do, please sharpen up* mode, but to merely be adoring and

---

<!-- Page 840 -->

adored. Her students might like her even more, at least for a while, if she did. It would be easier to let them saunter in and get settled on their own time, start class only when they seemed ready, teach for 45 instead of 52 minutes per day, and show movies sometimes just because a movie is a nice break. It would be easier to give almost everyone an A on every paper or better yet not grade papers at all, the better to never have anyone resent you or argue a grade.

Hammond has a name for this type of teacher: the sentimentalist. The sentimentalist is willing to reduce standards for students—either to be more liked by them or, as Hammond writes, “out of pity or because of poverty or oppression.” The sentimentalist “allows students to engage in behavior that is not in their best interest.” The sentimentalist, in other words, means well but loves to be loved; needs to be needed too much, or chooses the short-term benefits to herself of satisfying personal relationships over students’ long-term success and the ways in which strong relationships can be used to foster that.

Sentimentalism is an occupational hazard. It’s better to name it so that we can all check ourselves as we move through the journey of teaching. Am I too often doing what is easy because I want students to like me? Or am I pushing them—and myself—in a loving way that expects the best of all of us?

For me the technique of learning to be able to be both warm and strict *at exactly the same time* and finding the optimal balance of those things based on how it affects student learning is called *Warm/Strict*. It’s learning to be caring, funny, warm, concerned, and nurturing—but also strict, by the book, relentless, and sometimes uncompromising with students. It means establishing the importance of deadlines and expectations and procedures and, yes, rules. But *Warm/Strict* does not mean being unreasonable or inhumane. It does not mean never making

---

<!-- Page 841 -->

an exception; rather, it means making such decisions not based on popularity, but based on long-term commitment to your students' growth.

“In society we don't get very far if we are rude, if we talk back, if we talk over others, if we don't listen,” writes UK Headteacher and author Jo Facer. “In schools we need to escape the idea that teaching children how to behave is teaching them ‘obedience,’ a word that for many has connotations of oppression and fear.” Children who treat others poorly are not going to “magically transform themselves,” Facer goes on to point out. They rely on adults, ideally in partnership in and outside the classroom, to steer them towards behaviors that not only allow schools to function well but, more importantly, prepare them to be successful and valued members of society and community down the road.

I want to say a bit about the word “strict” specifically. It's a fraught word for some but I think it is worth using because it reminds us of something important: A teacher sets limits and expectations for and on behalf of a group, a culture. Young people with whom we are strict may not always be happy with those limits in the moment, but they also usually recognize in the long run that being held accountable by someone who cares about you is an important part of learning to make your way in the world. They are especially likely to arrive at this realization when the adult who is strict shows them that they care—deeply. The world will penalize a person who cannot meet deadlines. The caring teacher is not the one who allows a young person to make a habit of missing them again and again. The caring teacher says you have an immense capacity for excellence but deadlines matter and I want you to get this in on time. The caring teacher may even work with the student for whom this is a struggle, setting benchmarks, texting a reminder the night before. But in the

---

<!-- Page 842 -->

end the teacher may also have to set limits. If the work is late, there should be a penalty. You prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child.

There are caveats, of course. Sustaining strictness in the long run requires caring and warmth; students have to trust your intentions to do what is best for them even if they don't always like each decision. And ideally they should feel the caring most *in the moments you set limits*. A reset on expectations is a good time to smile. If there's one thing I've learned from studying teachers as a parent it is that if you said you'd give a consequence, you give the consequence, but you are also quick to tell the person you care about them and can't wait for things to be back to normal; for example, *You'll have to serve your detention, Michael, but I look forward to seeing you back in class tomorrow*. As Jo Facer puts it, “Having strict rules means you love children and want the best for them. Make sure you communicate that with your face and body language.”

Consider this interaction between Hasan Clayton and one of his students, a fifth grader whom I'll call Kevin, after Hasan noticed Kevin sleeping during a remote lesson (in 2020, that is). After class Hasan asked Kevin to stay on the call after his classmates left.

> Hasan: I noticed you were sleeping in class, Kevin.  
> Kevin: (Long pause. No answer.)  
> Hasan: Am I correct? Or am I wrong?  
> Kevin: You're correct.  
> Hasan: Why were you sleeping in class?  
> Kevin: I don't know. I thought I got a good sleep yesterday, but I still got tired.  
> Hasan: That's not good. Do you know how much material you're missing when you're sleeping?

---

<!-- Page 843 -->

Kevin: Yes.  
Hasan: Do you know how it makes me feel when you're sleeping?  
Kevin: It makes you feel sad.  
Hasan: It makes me feel like you don't think what we're doing in class is important.  
Kevin: So during independent practice today, what if I redo the lesson.  
Hasan: Yes, I would appreciate you doing that, going back and answering all the questions and then turning it in. We have to think about how our actions are affecting ourselves and our community.  
Kevin: OK.  
Hasan: All right, Kevin, I hope to see you later. If not, I'll see you tomorrow.  

Some notes:  
- Throughout the conversation Hasan never raised his voice or sounded angry. He also never sounded sweet or apologetic. I would describe him as composed. This is important. His goal was to cause Kevin to reflect on the cost of sleeping in class, not distract him with thoughts about whether Mr. Clayton was angry at him or induce defensiveness because he was being shouted at. *Emotional Constancy* was the order of the day.  
- Hasan required that Kevin acknowledge the fact that he was sleeping. When Kevin didn't respond to his initial statement *I noticed you were sleeping in class*, Hasan didn't say anything for a full six or seven seconds! He refused to bail Kevin out by chattering through the awkward silence with “It’s OK. Everyone gets tired sometimes.” After the silence, Hasan persisted: “Am I

---

<!-- Page 844 -->

correct or am I wrong?” He tacitly required Kevin to take ownership of his actions by acknowledging them.

- Once Kevin acknowledged his actions, Hasan's tone lightened ever so slightly and he asked: Why were you sleeping? He was still reserved. There's no baby talk—you could imagine a teacher using a *Why were you so-o sleepy?* approach here—but his tone reacts subtly to the degree to which Kevin owns the issue.

- When Kevin describes what's wrong with sleeping in class, Hasan does not excuse the action. He explains the problem and pauses again. His economy of language is noticeable. Adding extraneous verbiage makes the interaction more casual (see technique 58, *Strong Voice*), but Hasan wants formality here.

- Hasan focuses on depersonalizing the interaction and stressing *Purpose Over Power* (technique 56, *Firm, Calm Finesse*) rephrasing Kevin's assertion that he might have made Hasan “sad” to focus on learning—*It makes me feel like you don't think what we're doing in class is important.*

- Kevin suggests a consequence and Hasan agrees to it. A lot of teachers might say, “That's OK,” but Hasan accepts Kevin's proposed consequence because the consequence will help Kevin remember and allow Kevin to make a gesture of resolution—this is an important step in resolution and closure. Hasan tells Kevin he appreciates his solution and then, a bit warmer, reminds him that he looks forward to seeing him back in class.

Some useful tools for achieving *Warm/Strict*:

*Explain to students why you're doing what you're doing and how it is designed to help them:*³ “Priya, we don't do that in this classroom because it keeps us from making the most of

---

<!-- Page 845 -->

our learning time.” This emphasizes purpose rather than power.

Use *please* and *thank you*. “Please” and “thank you” cement the bonds of civility and community. We use them to show cordiality, appreciation, and respect. You want students to treat you and others with decency, civility, and caring, even if you must ask them to do things they may not be inclined to do, and therefore you should model that same decency, civility, and caring. “Please” and “thank you” do this. They help you express your caring and respect for students. This is especially important in moments that are most fraught.

Can “please” sound wrong? Of course, so some clarification is in order: It should not be a pleading please but a firm, respectful please. Usually that means very little pause after the “please” and a minimal degree of emphasis on the word. “Please take out your notebooks” in a steady rhythm with “please” no more emphasized than the rest of the words. “*Please* … take out your notebooks” is a sign of trouble—a subtle difference, but important.

Distinguish between *behavior* and *people*. When we give critical feedback or set limits, we want to say, “I believe in you” and “That can be better” at the same time. The first step is to frame critical comments as a judgment on an action, not a person.

Think for a moment about the phrase “You don’t,” as in:  
“You **don’t** put effort into your lab write-ups.”

Compare it to the same statement but with *didn’t* substituted for *don’t*: “You **didn’t** put much effort into this lab write-up.”

The word *don’t* judges. *This thing that you did is something you always do.* It globalizes a mistake and implies it is an enduring flaw. Maybe even hints at deliberateness. The

---

<!-- Page 846 -->

word *didn't* judges a one-time event. It leaves open the possibility that the person you are talking to usually does the right thing but failed to in this instance. It's one moment; we can fix it quickly.

But as some readers may have already noticed, even *didn't* focuses on the problem rather than the solution. Compare: “You *didn't* put effort into your lab write-up” to “You **must always** put your best effort into your lab write-ups.” Or “You **are capable of much more carefully written write-ups**.”

*Demonstrate that consequences are temporary.* Move on quickly and show students that when they have responded to a mistake via consequence or restitution, it is then in the past. Smile and greet them naturally as soon as possible afterwards to show that they are starting with a clean slate. You might tell a student, regarding her consequence, “After you're done, I can't wait to have you come back and show us your best.”

## TECHNIQUE 62: EMOTIONAL CONSTANCY

School is a sort of social laboratory for students; it is often the place where the greatest number of their interactions with broader society occur, and where, inevitably and fittingly, they experiment with decisions about the nature of their relationships with the people and institutions around them.

Even an experiment that ends perfectly contains some trial and error. A theory is developed (“Perhaps I don't need to do my homework every day”), tested, and evaluated (“OK, I think it is better when I do my homework”). Theory testing is one of the primary activities of youth, as I suspect your recollections of your own can attest—mine certainly do. In

---

<!-- Page 847 -->

many ways we are evolved to use our adolescent years to test limits and theories.

What that means is that the environment should provide the necessary feedback on experiments—the goal is not to tell young people that skipping homework is OK—in an atmosphere that treats experimentation as an expected event. We want to help those experiments yield useful and productive lessons, but also to remember that the behaviors we see often are experiments and that students themselves may not consciously realize that they are experimenting.

If this is the case, then maintaining *Emotional Constancy*—lessening the intensity of strong emotion, especially frustration and disappointment—is a key part of our job.

Generally speaking, strong negative emotions by teachers only intensify emotions among students. A student behaves poorly and takes a bit of an attitude; the teacher bristles back; the student reacts to the rising emotion by talking back more strongly, and a small mistake becomes larger. Or a student makes a mistake and a teacher snaps angrily at him while giving a consequence; part of him thinks, *Why is she yelling at me? Does she yell at me more than she yells at others?* He has these thoughts instead of reflecting on the connection between his actions and the consequence. The teacher's emotions insert another variable into the equation and distract him from his own behavior.

Compare that to Hasan Clayton's interaction with Kevin. With studious calm Hasan asked Kevin to take responsibility, and explained why the experiment led to poor outcome. And then Kevin proposed a consequence. This is to say, *Kevin heard everything Hasan said, in part because Hasan was not shouting it or reacting with shock.* Kevin shouldn't have slept through class but it was not thoroughly unexpected that he tried.

---

<!-- Page 848 -->

One of the most important tools you can use to maintain emotional constancy is to **Walk Slow**, which I mean literally and figuratively. Teaching young people to slow down their decisions is a good way to help them make better decisions—with the cortex and not the amygdala. Even a fraction of a second can make a difference. It’s the same for teachers. As you approach a situation that you yourself are emotional about, walk slowly—I mean this metaphorically—don’t rush to react—but also quite literally, move slowly when you feel yourself getting upset. I once observed Bridget McElduff in a lesson where a student laughed at another student for struggling to read a series of challenging words correctly aloud. Bridget was angry. She loved her students and felt a strong desire in particular to defend a student from mockery, especially in her own classroom, especially when it was a result of her taking exactly the sort of risk that was necessary to learning. Bridget began walking briskly over to address the laughing student, who was on the other side of the room.

But Bridget was able to tell herself to take a route around the back of the room and as she did that, she slowed her pace. This gave her a few precious seconds to compose herself and choose her words carefully. By the time Bridget got to the young man she was able to calmly explain why his behavior was unacceptable and remind him that she knew he was better than that. The walk was key. She needed a moment to get over her momma-bear anger. All it took was three or four seconds, but it really made a difference. Suddenly she realized that he was conducting an experiment. She had to help him reject the hypothesis: *laughing at a classmate was acceptable*. But she also had to understand that testing is what young people do.

Fools rush in. Anytime you feel yourself having a negative emotional response, strive to “walk slow”—literally or figuratively. A fraction of a second is often enough.

---

<!-- Page 849 -->

Here are some additional tips for maintaining your *Emotional Constancy*:

**Criticize behaviors rather than people.** "That behavior is inconsiderate" is a statement about a temporary situation. It's also a statement that, with a bit of tweaking, would allow you to show that you don't think that it's typical of a given student: "It's unlike you to behave this way. Please fix it immediately." This is better than making a permanent statement about a student: "You are inconsiderate." If your goal is trust, it can be a long way back from too many statements of that kind.

**Avoid globalizing.** Saying "You always" do X or asking "Why are you always doing" Y makes the conversation about events that are no longer within a student's control—and that he or she may not even remember. This makes the issue seem bigger and less focused on a specific action, and can make your correction feel like a "gotcha."

**Take your relationship out of it.** Telling a student you feel disappointed or betrayed by his or her actions, or personalizing your response—for example, "I thought I could trust you"—makes the interaction about you rather than about a student learning productive and socially responsible behavior. Framing things impersonally diffuses emotion and keeps your role in the conversation to that of coach and mediator, helping the student to learn those behaviors that will benefit her most in the long run.

**TECHNIQUE 63: JOY FACTOR**

The finest teachers offer up the work of learning to students with generous servings of joy expressed through

---

<!-- Page 850 -->

passion, enthusiasm, humor, and the like—not necessarily as the antidote to work but because those are some of the primary ways that work gets done—and just possibly because work, done right, can evoke joy. The classroom can and should be a joyful place and a few points of emphasis and understanding can help bring that to the fore in a sustainable and productive way. This is beneficial to achievement as well. A place where students (and teachers) feel satisfaction, gratification, and happiness is also likely to be a place where they work hard and persist, learn more, and are just possibly more creative. A bit of *Joy Factor* can help make yours not just a happy classroom but a high-achieving one.

Joy is complex, though—it can take a surprisingly wide array of forms. It can (but need not) involve singing or dancing, but it can just as easily be quiet: the pleasure of doing a challenging problem well, or as a team, or of seeing your work praised by your classmates. It is experienced by individuals and in small or large groups—for the most part, it is enhanced by sharing in some ways with others, which makes it ideal for classrooms. In *The Happiness Advantage*, Shawn Achor discusses research on three component elements of happiness: pleasure, engagement, and meaning. We are happy when we find pleasure, but happiness goes well beyond that. We are happy when we are connected and when we perceive ourselves to be doing something important. “People who pursue only pleasure experience only part of the benefits happiness can bring while those who pursue all three routes lead the fullest lives,” Achor continues. Pleasure, engagement, and meaning: all three should be the foci of our efforts to make our classrooms joyful places.

Let me start by drawing a small distinction between joy and fun.⁴ I don't draw this distinction to rule out fun in the classroom. Fun is part of joy. But joy is broader than fun.

---

<!-- Page 851 -->

And seeking fun as a purpose rather than joy in learning can lead us astray and so deserves caution. Let me explain both of those ideas.

In distinguishing joy from fun, one teacher wrote me to emphasize the feeling of joy brought about by “the feeling of success after hard work” and the “celebration of success, both individual and collective,” not to mention “a bit of awe and wonder—experiencing something new and amazing.”⁵

Two powerful sources of joy that I have discussed elsewhere in this book are belonging and flow. Belonging is an intense feeling of membership in group. Inclusion in groups was maybe the single most important factor in our evolutionary success as a species. Those who were able to join with, collaborate in, and maintain membership with groups survived. Those that weren't, didn't. We evolved to be intensely sensitive to the status of our own membership. “Belonging feels like it happens from the inside out, but in fact it happens from the outside in,” writes Daniel Coyle in *The Culture Code*. But, he adds, people don't just need to hear once that they are included; they need to receive signals over and over, to be happy. Belonging, according to Coyle, is “a flame that needs to be continually fed by signals of safe connection.”

We often feel the greatest joy when we feel belonging. This perhaps is why singing, in particular choral singing, is part of practically every culture on earth and specifically a feature of worship in those cultures. When we sing together we affirm that we all know the words, literally and metaphorically, and show our ability to coordinate. We subsume our own yearnings in the group. Done even briefly this can have a profound effect on us, which is especially worth remembering in the midst of the most individualistic society in the world. The wholeness and joy of belonging

---

<!-- Page 852 -->

that our evolutionary self requires is something [or *the thing*, or *the one thing*] that our rational self is most likely to overlook or even scorn.

This is something we can unlock in the classroom. Singing is an obvious example. Watch the joy in the faces of Nicole Warren's students as they start their class signing a math song they know by heart (see *Nicole Warren: Keystone*). It's everything a part of us is socialized to scorn: rote, ritual, memorized, familiar to the point of repetitive. And yet the students are clearly happy. (Note also the joy in their faces at the end of the video when Nicole circulates and helps them to see their accomplishments.) Note that the gestures emphasize the chorality of the experience—people love to “know the moves,” and here knowing the moves is visible and so therefore is the belonging. Our own math song is even better than one lots of people know; we all know the words and can voice in unison something other people don't know about. *Knowing things others don't know or aren't aware of* is a key to belonging.

Music can be a source of joy even when it is not choral. It is unclear why, but every culture on earth sings and creates music. They use those things to define themselves. Some evolutionary biologists suggest that singing predated language as we know it—that before we had words we had music, which allowed us to express emotion and urgent information over distance. We sang ourselves into battle or into comfort afterwards, and this is wired into us. We have evolved with a proclivity for music, so we can assume it had evolutionary benefit in some way and that we evolved to take pleasure in it.

You can hear snippets of song throughout some of the videos in this book, such as Summer Payne in *Cold Call* singing, “individual tur-urns listen for your na-ame,” or Christine Torres in *Format Matters* singing, “don't turn to

---

<!-- Page 853 -->

the wall ‘cuz the wall don't care.” And every time you use Call and Response ([technique 35](#)) you are in fact using a sort of simple chanting: *together in one voice*, you are saying, we all belong.

So singing, especially shared songs, can be a source of joy. But it can also remind us of how profound coordinated activity is to building a sense of belonging. Even sharing the experience together of hearing a text read aloud or reading a text aloud together as a group (see [technique 24](#), FASE Reading), taking turns and bringing a whole to life through our efforts as individuals can awaken this feeling—the construction of a whole in which we subsume our individuality briefly and emerge gratified and infused with a sense of belonging and meaning.

Knowing “what to do” makes us feel as if we belong. Perhaps this explains the unexpected happiness students sometimes exude in learning the routines of the classroom. We think we're teaching a tool for efficiency but students are receiving a signal that they belong. Done well, known routines and choral behaviors can be the seeds of membership.

Several pages back, now, I also mentioned “flow” and this too is critical to understanding the difference between joy and fun: We like to lose ourselves in a challenging activity that sweeps us up in its momentum. We are often happiest when this happens. Any coach will tell you that one of the biggest teaching challenges in a sports setting is breaking the flow. You blow the whistle to talk about how the defense should be positioned and after a few seconds you start to see a gradual lurking frustration: *We want to play, Coach; please stop talking so we can play.* This reminds us that the core activity and its design are critical and that when they are well designed, joy is powerful because it is sprinkled in small moments—playful, silly, absurd, expressing belonging

---

<!-- Page 854 -->

—that come and go quickly enough to augment and work in synergy with the sense of flow.

Consider how Christine Torres drops quick humorous comments into her lesson. The vocabulary word is “caustic” and the *Turn and Talk* asks students to engage an inside joke: “Imagine Ms. Torres is a contestant on *American Idol*; what's a ‘caustic’ remark a judge might make about her singing?” Don't be silly, she adds, he would never make a caustic remark about Ms. Torres's singing. Maybe you see the belonging cues there: Ms. Torres's talent as a singer is an ongoing discussion, a sort of inside joke you would only get if you were in her class. But also note the speed of it. It’s a quick laugh that preserves the sense of flow. The joy students feel comes as much from their engaged study of the vocabulary as it does from the joke. Christine’s humor sits off stage and comments amusingly on the main action, but the lesson is still the star. Nicole Warren's math song works because it is fast. It would be half as joyful if it were twice as long.

This, I think, is another reason why it's important to differentiate joy from fun. We can play *Jeopardy!* to review during class today and that will be fun, but interestingly it may not also be joyful unless we engineer it well so that it is designed for flow. We can all recall the “fun” activity we designed that sparked no joy because the flow wasn't there or because the group dynamics didn't work well. And while we're at it, please recognize that the word “fun” can distract us. Most young people have fun when they play video games—though interestingly I am not sure they are joyful, perhaps because the degree of connection and belonging is missing. You can refer to “having fun” by itself but you don't “have joy” by itself. You *take joy or feel joy in doing something*. “Joy” is clearer on purpose than “fun.” It has meaning and engagement.

<!-- Page 855 -->

In a recent social media post I asked teachers for insights on how they thought about joy in the classroom. How did they create “productive joy”? I asked. I used the phrase to stress the idea that what we sought was joy that served learning. That seemed obvious to me. “Sounds controlling,” one skeptic responded. She wanted to know why I felt the need to make it “productive” and to dictate the terms of someone else's happiness. But I hope it is obvious to the great majority of teachers that the goal is to achieve joy *in the tasks of learning*. If we don't seek to make joy a cause of as much learning as possible and the maximum amount of learning joyful, we have lost our way. But of course there is the risk that the fun runs away from us and we forget that it is there to serve the learning. Happily it is not only possible to do both, but the goals are just possibly synergistic. People generally like learning things. Don't play *Jeopardy!* unless it is rigorous enough to support learning, but also know that if it is challenging and engaging, joy will be more likely to arise from it.

Let me apply the conversation about flow and belonging to an additional source of classroom joy: humor is immensely beneficial to creating joy—we almost always smile when we laugh, and we often remember the joke forever (see note 7 in this chapter for an example). But *small recurring inside jokes* are especially powerful because of the way they maximize belonging and flow: Christine Torres joking about her excellent singing; a nickname for a character in history (one teacher called Orsino in *Twelfth Night* “wet wipe” because he was so spineless compared to the female leads in the play⁶); or consider my high school history teacher, Mr. Gilhool, who was the master of the inside joke: he (and soon we) always referred to the city of “Amsterdarn” to civilize its “vulgar” name; he dramatized Count von Schlieffen on his deathbed advising Bismarck “to keep the West strong” and afterwards anytime anyone mentioned

---

<!-- Page 856 -->

World War I military tactics, Gilhool would remind us of von Schlieffen's words with a brief dramatization (except in cases where we remembered to do it first).

These jokes all happened in less than a second. That was part of the fun. Mr. Gilhool was also teaching with substance and pace while the inside jokes were coming at you fast, so you had to be paying attention or you'd miss the moment when he made a brief motion like he was weighing something on scales when he mentioned any philosopher's name,7 which was why everyone around you was laughing. (See note 7 for an explanation.) Part of what made Mr. Gilhool great was that we were learning a ton and part of it was getting the joke. These things were synergistic; so were the memory aspects. For what it's worth I still sometimes say “Amsterdam” to this day and more importantly I still remember the Schlieffen Plan. Humor is powerful, especially when it is *used in the service of learning via small recurring inside jokes*.8

I'd like to make mention of the importance with *Joy Factor* of “being you.” I could probably come up with a few inside jokes—my children might weigh in on the small likelihood of their being funny—but I cannot and could not not sing. Which is important to recognize and respect. No singing for some of us. Steer carefully with humor if you can't pull it off.

I mention this also because I'm about to discuss a video of a teacher who is brilliant at what he does and when I watch him I know I could not do those things. Joyful things are hard to force. The message of the video *Darren Hollingsworth: Rabble* is that enthusiasm matters. Enthusiasm can look a lot of ways. It doesn't have to be as extroverted as Darren's but his is certainly magic to listen to. He's greeting students passing in the hallway and at the *Threshold* (see [technique 47](#)) before class at Great

---

<!-- Page 857 -->

Yarmouth Academy in Great Yarmouth, England. His banter is priceless. Consider the student to whom he says, “Are you Mr. Pellow's brother?” He's new to the school and suddenly feels known, picked out of the mass of students in the hallway, called a “top man.” (But also, à la *Warm/Strict*, reminded that “Yes, sir” is the proper response to an adult.9) The students are greeted joyfully, playfully, warmly, individually, and by name as they enter. Stopped and called —tongue in cheek—“a rabble” because the line is not tidy, but they're also expected to fix the line and come in properly. There's joy and there's high expectation and regularly the twain shall meet.

Most people can't be Darren but everyone can find a version of themselves that evokes a unique form of joy. And it's worth remarking on the power of the happiness whatever form it takes. “Students primed to feel happy before taking math tests far outperformed their neutral peers,” Shawn Achor writes in the *Happiness Advantage*. “Our brains are wired to work best when we are happy.” So simply smiling, and saying, “I think you'll enjoy this lesson today,” can be almost as good a starting point.

## Notes

1. In his short, elegant, and immensely useful book *Motivated Teaching*. I recommend it unreservedly.

2. Carroll says this in a video the Seahawks produced called [Practice Is Everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMLa6fM10KA).

3. A technique called *Explain Everything* is highlighted in the first edition of this book. The technique helps students understand how what you and they are doing in the classroom will advance them academically. For more

information, visit [www.teachlikeachampion.com/yourlibrary](www.teachlikeachampion.com/yourlibrary).

4. I am indebted to Mark Chatley of Maidstone, England, who pointed out this distinction in a tweet when I asked for guidance from educators recently.

5. These are Mark’s words. I am grateful for them.

6. “Leane Elizabeth” from Leicester, England, shared this in a tweet. The best part was that she had to explain the reference to me in a subsequent note *because it was an* inside joke.

7. This requires a note but the note requires a warning: I am going to tell you a story about long ago. It involves an approach to teaching that *I am not advocating and not advising you consider using*. Mr. Gilhool memorably opined, while making a movement as if balancing two sides of a scale: “Goethe, Herder, Hegel: I’d trade ’em all for a six-pack and a tank of gas,” by which he meant to argue the point of view that philosophers were of small practical value to most of society. If he mentioned some great thinker who might be high-minded and out of touch with society he would make the weighing motion and we would think about his hilarious words trading philosophers for something practical and be reminded of the pragmatist’s argument in a way we found hilarious. Again, I hope it is clear that you should *not* say this to students now. When Mr. G said this in the 1980s, people said and thought different things. We were seniors in high school and the drinking age was 18. Nonetheless, before you scorn Mr. Gilhool, let it be known that I would never have heard of Herder were it not for Mr. Gilhool and I read Goethe for the first time in part because I wanted to see what Gilhool was talking about, just as I

<!-- Page 859 -->

remember the Schlieffen Plan today in large part because of his humorous portrayal of it.

8. Thank you to Ian White, a teacher in Hackney, London, who used the phrase “little inside jokes” in responding to a post I’d written on Twitter, which gave rise to this meditation and my phrase “small recurring inside jokes.” His phrase is probably better.

9. I am not arguing for students calling adults “Sir” and “Ma’am.” It’s not part of any technique or guidance. They do it in a lot of English schools. It can be lovely. I’d be happy if Darren were my teacher and warmly set expectations for me like that, but you might feel differently. Do this if it inspires you; don’t do it if you don’t like it.
