# Chapter 8
## Building Ratio Through Writing

The amount and quality of writing students do in your classroom is one of the most important determinants of their academic success—possibly the single most important thing—so one of the simplest and most powerful shifts you can make is to increase the amount of writing—especially high-quality writing—your students do. Why ask, “Who can tell me what Jonas has just realized about what it means to be *released*?” and have one or two students answer, when you could say, “Please tell me what Jonas has just realized about what it means to be *released*. One minute to write some thoughts in your packet. Go!” This shift means every student answers and every student battles to frame the thought in precise syntax. Teachers often define a sentence as “a complete thought.” By having students write more, we cause them to push their ideas from vague notions or developing ideas to complete thoughts; to practice developing complete thoughts is to practice perhaps the core task of thinking.

Increasing the amount of writing in your class raises important questions, however, from the practical (*How do I get them to actually write?*) to the philosophical (*Where in the sequence of learning is writing most valuable? How can I build a process-oriented culture of revision into my writing?*). For that reason, this chapter looks at techniques that can help you use writing for maximum effect on both Participation Ratio and Think Ratio.

### TECHNIQUE 38: EVERYBODY WRITES

---

<!-- Page 574 -->

When we think about writing that is part of the process of learning and mastering content, we see teachers use three primary types.

One of them, developmental writing, I'll define in technique 41, *Art of the Sentence*. For now I want to define a concept called *formative writing* and compare it to the more common *summative writing*. The technique *Everybody Writes* is about using *formative writing* prompts frequently throughout class.

*Formative writing* is writing in which students seek to decide rather than explain what they think. The purpose is to use writing as a tool to think: to develop and discover new insights rather than to justify an opinion they already have. In contrast, the purpose of *summative writing* is to explain or justify the writer's opinion and often to include evidence to create a supporting argument. *Summative writing* says: *Here is what I think and why*. To complete a summative writing task, students must already know what they think and be ready to marshal evidence and select an appropriate structure to make a cogent argument.

*Summative writing* is probably the most common form of analytical writing done in schools, in part because it looks like—and therefore (we often think) must prepare—students for the sorts of questions they are asked on assessments.

Again, in *summative writing* you have to know what you think before you start; in *formative writing* the purpose is to find out. Here's a gallery of *summative* and *formative* prompts from different subjects, placed side by side for comparison:

| | **Formative Prompts** | **Summative Prompts** |
|---|---|---|

<!-- Page 575 -->

|  | Formative Prompts | Summative Prompts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ELA | What might the figs be symbolic of in this chapter? What are some reasons they keep appearing? | Explain the symbolism of the figs in the chapter and explain what Munoz-Ryan was attempting to accomplish with this symbol. Make reference to at least three occasions in which the figs appear. |
| Math | Why might solving this system of equations be more difficult than the last example? | Explain how you solved the system of equations above. |
| Science | Would you expect neurons to have a high or low surface area to volume ratio? Why? | Explain whether neurons have a high or low surface-area-to-volume ratio. Be sure to reference specific details about their cellular design. |
| History | What strikes you about Olmec civilization, especially any images or ideas that might appear in later Meso-American cultures? | Explain to what degree the Olmec civilization influenced subsequent civilizations in Mexico. Include two pieces of evidence to support your argument. |

|  | Formative Prompts | Summative Prompts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Early Elementary | How might Paddington be feeling in this moment? Why? | Based on this story, what are two character traits that describe Paddington? Support your answer with details from the text. |
| Arts | What ideas might the artist be attempting to convey with his choice of colors here? | Explain Picasso's theory of color during his Blue Period and the impact it had on the art world. |

One thing you've probably noticed is the openness of the formative prompts. They ask for “some reasons” rather than “the reason” or “the reasons”—all of them, presumably. The change encourages students to consider more than one possible answer and implies that it’s hard to say how many reasons there might be. They ask questions for which it is hard to be wholly wrong as long as you are diligent and thoughtful, as in: “What strikes you about …” Perhaps the most important word in many formative prompts is the word “might.” What might the figs be symbolic of? Rather than: What are the figs symbolic of? Or: What ideas might the artist be attempting to convey with his choice of colors? “Might” makes it clear that the goal is to explore, not to prove; the stakes are lowered.

The lowering of stakes can be powerful with writing. Putting words to the page is intimidating, so it is understandable that many students may have trouble beginning the process. “I don’t know how to start,” they tell us. Often, perhaps, that’s because summative prompts set the bar so high. “Explain your opinion about X or Y.” There are Xs and Ys in the world I have been thinking about for

<!-- Page 577 -->

years and still have not fully arrived at an opinion about. I hereby propose that the ability to think without deciding too early is a very good thing intellectually. A formative prompt lets you start with maybe. *Maybe one reason is ...*

A few years ago, we discussed the idea of formative writing with Ashley LaGrassa, then an eighth-grade English teacher at Rochester Prep in Rochester, New York, and she decided to give it a try. After all, eighth grade might be one of the toughest years for getting students to open up in writing.

> “The idea that a simple change of format might make my classroom feel safer for students, leading them to take risks and engage more deeply, was too alluring to pass up,” Ashley said, “and the result was one of the most joyful lessons of the year. My eighth graders jumped in to wrestle with challenging questions, pregnant with the possibility of multiple ‘right’ answers.” Afterwards she reflected on what worked and why.

The lesson focused on Alice Walker's “Beauty: When the Other-Dancer Is the Self” and began with formative writing as part of the *Do Now*: “How might Alice Walker's experiences have influenced her writing?”

> “My hope in including the word ‘might’ was to help students feel safe jumping in with thoughts rather than comprehensive answers,” she said. Students jumped in and she was happily surprised to see “twice as many hands as usual” offering to share their answers. On a later question, *Reflect on the role of gender in Walker's experience*, she again found that “students went right to work. There was no flipping through the packet or rewriting of the question to pass time. Students began quickly jotting down their thoughts; seemingly, the sense of possibility within the question made students feel more comfortable with risk.”

---

<!-- Page 578 -->

The subsequent discussion too crackled to life. “Within moments, students were deeply analyzing the impact a scar discussed in the text had on Walker in light of her gender, moving from her specific experience to a message about society at large. By asking students for their *reflections*, the question invited students to share all thoughts and suggested a validity in a variety of responses. This encouraged them and prepared them to take the risks.”

Formative questions made writing a “low-risk adventure” in which students “didn't always have to have a final argument about the theme to discuss the story.” You can see this play out in the video *Arielle Hoo: Keystone*. Arielle asks her students to write their “conjectures” to start their reflection on a problem. She is suggesting, “We're just thinking and experimenting with ideas at this point.” She says *go* and the class springs into action.

Ironically, students are more likely to have a strong final argument about the theme if they'd had time to wrestle with the idea formatively first. In other words, the argument isn't that formative writing is “better” than summative writing, because it isn't. Both are important and students need to be able to do both. Rather, the argument is that formative writing is *also* necessary—if more likely to be overlooked—and that the two types of writing are synergistic in a dozen ways. For example, formative writing helps students engage in and care about the text so that they feel more vested in any argument they then decide to defend or explain in summative writing … which in turn helps them to understand what things they should seek to understand or figure out through formative writing.

One other key aspect of the writing prompts used in *Everybody Writes*: they occur and reoccur, midstream and throughout in the lesson, while ideas are fresh. Teachers often call their *Everybody Writes* prompts “Stop and Jots”

---

<!-- Page 579 -->

for two reasons: (1) The word “jot” expresses the informality and conjectural nature of the exercise. And the responses are pretty short. These aren't essays. They're forty-five, sixty, and ninety-second reflections. (2) The “stop” implies that *students are in the midst* of doing something else. We want students to write formatively as they are experiencing an idea, a question, an uncertainty. We want them to “stop” and wrestle with it on the page while the question is fresh in their heads.

So the idea behind *Everybody Writes* is simple. Ask students to write frequently and formatively and do it midstream, in short bursts throughout your lesson. Suddenly you will awaken students to a whole new side of writing. You will help them learn to think in writing.

Some other benefits of *Everybody Writes*:

- Because you can review student ideas in advance by reading over their shoulders, you're able to select useful responses to begin discussion. Of course, there will be other times when rather than looking for exemplary responses, you will seek Stop and Jots that show ideas that are partially developed or show a common confusion. It all depends what you are looking for.

- If you use *Everybody Writes* before discussion, then every idea that gets shared aloud is in effect a second draft, a thought of higher quality than what would otherwise have been shared without the opportunity to think in writing first.

- *Everybody Writes* also allows you to *Cold Call* students with the confidence that they have been set up to succeed, because you know that everyone is prepared with thoughts. You can simply ask, “What did you write about, Avery?” to kick things off.

---

<!-- Page 580 -->

A final thought: the more you use writing, the better (and more efficient) your students get at using it. The first time you try it, it may take students a bit of time to get started; the quality may be only so-so. But by the time they are answering reflection prompt number 87, as students in *Jessica Bracey: Keystone* do, they are very good and very efficient at using the *Everybody Writes* moment as an opportunity to develop their thoughts. Practicing something important eighty-six times will have that effect. This was certainly evident in Jessica's class: not only was the post-writing discussion of high quality, but it began with almost every hand shooting into the air. Having had an opportunity to “write to determine what they think,” they are now ready to discuss, expand, and refine their ideas in discussion.

## TECHNIQUE 39: SILENT SOLO

Successful teaching often consists of sublime moments achieved in part via mundane tools. That is certainly true of this chapter, which describes how changes in the ways we ask students to write can transform the ways they think and maximize the value and quality of other activities we engage in as well. If you can get everyone in the room to write for a sustained period of time, the benefits to student thinking and discussion will be many.

- Giving students the opportunity to write for a minute or so before a discussion will lead to better listening, more confident participation, and higher-quality ideas to share.
- Short, formative written reflections in the midst of learning can help students not just to document what they think but to discover and expand it.

---

<!-- Page 581 -->

- Glancing over students' shoulders at the ideas they are wrestling with in response to a question can allow you to “hunt” (select students or ideas that deserve the class’s attention and focus) rather than “fish” (call on students blindly in hopes that what they share will be germane or apropos). A Cold Call that starts, “Tariq, you used a fascinating word in your reflection: spurned. Can you talk about that a bit?” changes not only the discussion but Tariq's sense of himself as a valued thinker in the classroom.

Those are powerful things. But the *if* in “If you can get everyone to write” is a big one, especially if you raise your sights even a little higher—as in: “If you can reliably get every student to write willingly, thoughtfully, and on cue, and to sustain the effort for a significant duration.”

It’s a case where the sublime rests upon mastery of the mundane. The technique Silent Solo involves an apparently mundane goal: teaching students to reliably write, on cue, as a matter of habit. Once established, the technique is nearly invisible, manifested in humble moments observers might overlook. You say, of the outcome of an experiment or a scene in the novel, “Well, that was unexpected. Take 90 seconds to reflect in writing on reasons why this might have happened. Go!” Even though suddenly every pencil is scratching, observers might yawn and glance out the windows. They might see it as downtime—a little break in class. They might think your students arrived in your classroom doing that naturally. They’d be wrong, of course.

*Silent Solo* lets you send students into a task where the Participation Ratio is high—everyone in the room answering the question at once—and the Think Ratio is as well—framing ideas carefully in words is an inherently rigorous task. But the ability to conjure a moment like that

---

<!-- Page 582 -->

—reliably, over and over—requires consistency and attention to detail to establish.

I want to pause here and underscore the role of silence in *Silent Solo*. It’s not just writing but *quiet writing* that’s the necessary routine. For some, that’s a tough sell. Your vision of an ideal class might be characterized by boisterous discussion or passionate debate. However, providing time for focused, thoughtful reflection (typically prior to that full-voiced discussion or debate) gives all students a moment to gather their ideas, to listen to their own inner voice, and capture elusive ideas that only yield when you stick with them. Silence is necessary to the deepest reflection.1 Students deserve to experience it—doubly so in a screen-filled world where exactly that sustained, uninterrupted reflection is so rare. They may not get the opportunity anywhere else.

The time your students spend with their pencils transcribing the reflections of a quiet mind will build their ability to sustain focus and likely result in their best thinking. The resulting discussion will ironically be more likely to crackle with life if you allow it to be preceded by thoughtful silence.

You can see the power of the system at work in the video *Montage: Silent Solo*.

Within seconds of Hasan Clayton’s prompt “eyes in,” every student is at work, reflecting thoughtfully in writing on Hasan’s question. They start on cue and sustain this for four solid minutes. Four minutes of sustained reflection in a world where attention is increasingly fractured and interrupted by technology is a profound thing.

At the drop of a hat, Tamesha McGuire’s first graders are off and writing too, reflecting on the strategies they used to make sets of ten. Compare this to a typical classroom

---

<!-- Page 583 -->

where a teacher might ask for verbal answers: “What strategies did you use to make ten?” In that case a few students might answer, describing gamely but perhaps imprecisely, what they did. In Tamesha's classroom everyone answers and describes their thinking with the precise word choice and syntax that writing demands. You can't flex the written word like the spoken one. To write is to think harder. Both ratios have been multiplied.

“Go ahead, take one minute,” Jamila Hammet tells the students at her table; they grab their pencils and are off. The writing is of shorter duration than Hasan's. They're reading *Because of Winn-Dixie* and the question is about how they feel when looking at a picture of a dog. The lesson is about the nature of the bonds between animals and humans. She wants to insert a short period of personal reflection to help students understand the characters in the novel better. As they write, they are focused, intent, and quite happy to be putting their thoughts down on paper. Because the routine is so solid, Jamila can insert small bursts of writing like this at almost any point in her lesson to increase the quality of student reflection, the amount of participation, or to give students a moment to shift gears and respond thoughtfully.

You can see a version of this system, slightly modified for older students, in Sadie McCleary’s Chemistry class. Her students answer three questions over six minutes. Efficient, focused, and effective, every student is on task and doing the core work of chemistry independently and in writing.

The goal of *Silent Solo*, as these teachers show, is a shared habit: one in which all students engage and some perhaps look forward to. There are clues in the montage as to how the habit was built and is maintained:

---

<!-- Page 584 -->

- Tamesha is warm, upbeat, and cheery. She first praises effort where she sees it, naming specific students so they feel seen and important, then quickly transitions to reading quietly over students' shoulders to show how much she values their ideas.
- Hasan, too, shows his appreciation for students who engage the writing straight away. He modulates his voice, lowering it to use a more reflective tone that matches the task. He reminds his students to write in complete sentences.
- Jamila's language—“go ahead”—and her hint of a smile imply that students must be eager to write and cherish the opportunity for reflection. Perhaps at first some did and some didn't, but I suspect her introduction made a least a few feel more excited.
- Sadie adapts her routine to a problem set. She's clear about the task and the time and graciously protects the transition to begin from disruption with a nonverbal “pause” signal and a promise to come check in with her students individually. To lose momentum would have been a catastrophe for the focus she'd created.

The downside of these videos is that they show you—mostly —what it looks likes *after* the routine is formed. Applying what we know about building strong and successful habits will be critical to understanding the initial steps required to establish *Silent Solo* in your classroom.

A habit is a chain of actions that happen in sequence. Since one action is dependent on the one prior we are required to be intentional about the design of the component parts and how students learn them. To sustain and maximize a habit we also have to think about motivation—how do we get students to embrace the habit willingly, as students appear to do in Hasan’s, Tamesha’s, Jamila’s, and Sadie's

---

<!-- Page 585 -->

classrooms, so that independent work becomes a joy rather than a chore? We have to ask: *What makes students likely to follow—eagerly even—the chain of actions in the habit?*

To turn an activity into a routine, make your directions *simple, clear cut, and stepped*, says Peps Mccrea.2 You want first steps that are easily remembered and require few decisions. This makes the habit easy to activate, as a counter-example may show. Let's say you've planned for students to reflect on your question for three minutes in writing. You say, “Please take out a piece of paper and answer the question, Why do most animals live in the canopy of a typical rainforest?” Unfortunately, at this point, success is already in doubt. You have thirty students and some number of them will struggle to find paper. Someone will have to decide what kind of paper to use … and possibly discuss this with a peer … or ask you: *Is this paper OK? I don't have any notebook paper. Is this OK?* Someone else will ask for something to write on. Distraction will replace the quiet hum of thinking in writing—*Have we started yet, Ms. Collins?*—and the three minutes you've allocated for this written task will quickly evaporate.

If students already have journals handy or out on their desks, when you say, “Why do most animals live in the canopy of a typical rainforest? Go,” initiating the chain of actions would be far easier and there would be fewer interruptions. Notice how this happens in the video *Jessica Bracey: Keystone*. She tells her students to start writing in their journals, which are on their desks. Within seconds they are all deeply engaged in the task. Every student. The speed of their response is important. It's not just that potentially wasted time is made productive; it's that there is continuity of thinking. The ideas that were in their heads as they read are still in their heads as they write, undisturbed by a shuffle for paper or search for a pen.

---

<!-- Page 586 -->

Routines like this harvest attention as much as they harvest time.

You could replace journals with notes or notebooks (as Sadie McCleary does) or with a packet. In fact, as I discuss in technique 4, *Double Plan*, one of the main benefits of having a packet—a single document where students can engage with all aspects of the lesson—is that it preserves continuity of student thought throughout the lesson. When the question is written down, students can check it so they don't lose sight of their focus as they write. Having the question prewritten also simplifies direction giving. One of the reasons directions are vague or unclear is that we are trying to frame the question as we assign it. Planning it in advance and writing it down protects against this.

Recall, for example, the packet from Reading Reconsidered Curriculum that I shared in technique 4, *Double Plan*. Since every student is working from the same page, and all have the same space in which to reflect before discussion, every brain maximizes its engagement with the academic task, rather than the logistics of how and where to complete it. When you give the cue, students dive into writing time with their thoughts intact. Simplicity has made the habit easy to activate, with benefits in focus and depth of thinking.

“Make the first action easy off the blocks,” Mccrea continues, and students will be more vested in the rest of the routine. The videos in the montage show the power of this. The goal when you begin building the routine is the simplest possible activation step: to get pencils moving. All of them. Right away. Later, you can layer in further expectations; for now you want to make it as simple as possible to succeed. It helps if the cue to begin is consistent—same words every time—and if it’s short and delivered in a crisp tone that “pops” so that students react quickly and decisively. Mccrea notes that a good cue should

---

<!-- Page 587 -->

be “punchy”—short and delivered with a change of tone or pace. The cues in the video have this in common. We want students bursting out of the blocks. The synchrony of everyone taking action at once makes the norm more visible and reinforces it. “Go!” is a great punchy cue—as in *One minute to think in writing. Go!*—but there are alternatives: Hasan says “Eyes in” and Tamesha uses the slightly more playful “Go to work.”

The second key aspect of the activation step is that it be *clear cut*. The less gray area, the better. “Where possible, actions should be things that can be considered done or not done, rather than partially done.” It’s clear, then, whether the routine is happening successfully and productively. That’s why pencils moving is such an ideal first step. If students’ pencils are moving, Silent Solo is happening. If they are not, it is not the habit you had envisioned and therefore not serving students to the best possible effect. Some teachers’ in-cue when establishing the routine is “Pencils moving. Go!” Later they remove the “Pencils moving” part.

The importance of a crisp start raises an important question, however. Students, understandably, may ask for time to think before they write. As I discuss in [technique 38](#), *Everybody Writes*, thinking through writing is, for most students, a new way of processing and students will initially want to process in the way they perceive themselves to have been most successful in the past, by first reflecting and then writing. This is where your rollout to students is key. You might say something like: “When I say go, please do your best to answer question 2 in your packet. This exercise is not for a grade—what you write is for you and you won’t turn it in.³ Challenge yourself to think in writing! I will expect to see your pencils moving the whole time. Go!” Or you might say, “It will be hard, but push yourself. You will learn to write your way through

---

<!-- Page 588 -->

anxieties and concerns. If you get stuck, write about why you are stuck.” Or say, “A better question might have been … But keep your pencil moving! Go!” The keys here are relieving the pressure students may be feeling to get the answer “right” and getting students started trying to think in writing. Later you can add expectations⁴ and the technique will establish for your students an indispensable cognitive tool. For now you want a vibrant, positive norm.

You can also start small. The first time you assign *Silent Solo* writing, do it for forty-five seconds. Challenge students to see if they can write the whole way. Help them by making the initial question an interesting one and maybe by giving them a phrase to start off their answer if they get stuck. Ensuring success is ensuring buy-in. The next time your goal will be a minute. Later, ninety seconds. Within a month you'll be writing for five or ten minutes at a stretch. But if you try to start with ten minutes you likely won't get there because students will, effectively, practice struggling. You want them to practice succeeding.

Most likely, students will continue to seek assistance with this challenging task, even after the rollout and even after time has been extended. As you circulate, students will likely call you over and want to tell you what they are thinking instead of or before writing it down. Remember, allowing them to talk instead of writing to explore their thoughts won't help them learn to think in writing, and that is the cognitive habit we are aiming for. Try saying something like “I can't wait to read it once you've written it” or “Great, get it down before you forget it.” This brief pep talk both refocuses students on the essential challenge of the task (the writing) and reassures them at a tough moment that whatever they get down will be valuable to themselves and to the class’s discourse.

A few other implementation notes:

---

<!-- Page 589 -->

- Another key source of motivation is transparency of purpose. Understanding the “why” behind a task usually helps the reluctant or skeptical get started. You'd want to understand why this “silent writing” wasn't busy work, too. So you might preview—briefly!—what comes later in the lesson (“Take one minute *Silent Solo* to write down some ideas about what Esperanza's doll might represent. We're going to use these ideas to shape our discussion of symbolism when the timer goes off”) or building investment up front (“Reading your faces, I think this chapter intrigued you. I can't wait to read some of your thoughts. Take one minute to jot your observations. Go!”). Linking moments of *Silent Solo* with the larger trajectory of the lesson can help students feel invested in their writing and more likely to make the most of the time provided.

- Student motivation is also impacted by what you do as they're working. If your affect and actions show students their ideas have value, it will provide an incentive to continue writing. As you circulate, remind students gently and warmly of expectations if needed—“keep those pencils moving”—but not exclusively or even primarily. Make sure to also take the time to read over shoulders, comment, and nod appreciatively. *Oh, that's interesting, Carol. Can't wait to talk about that, Grant. Nice, Israel. Great word …* or just raise your eyebrows and smile. Appreciating the content of what students have written makes them feel successful and scholarly and it will help make strong thinking a habit.

The clip *Emily Badillo: Three Minutes on Your Own* shows many of the elements of habit-building in action. Emily is a guest teacher in the classroom where this clip is filmed so it's her first time working with these students. (She's piloting the Reading Reconsidered Curriculum my team has

<!-- Page 590 -->

developed.⁵) You can see that her question is already written in a packet that all students have on their desks. Students’ task is to begin writing as soon as they read it. She explicitly calls the habit of independent writing *Silent Solo*, by the way. It’s a catchy phrase but it also reminds her students of the rules. We took the name of this habit from hearing a teacher—we’re not sure who!—use that phrase: *Silent Solo*. Two minutes. What has Cassie just found out? Go.

A few other things you’ll see Emily do (and the time in the video where you see them):

- 0:18: Emily sets up a challenge task that students “get” to do if they’re done early. It’s framed positively (a challenge) but one big excuse for why they wouldn’t be writing (“I’m done!”) has already been eliminated.
- 0:26: Emily sets the timer. This makes the goal of writing for three minutes real and tangible. (For more, see technique 30, *Work the Clock*.)
- 0:29: Emily slows down her pace in circulating and looks carefully to see if students are following through—carefully enough for them to notice her in their peripheral vision. The message is: I am looking carefully to see if everyone is writing. If you show it matters to you, it will be far more likely to matter to students.
- 0:32: Emily narrates her expectation: She is “looking for a table where everybody’s pencil is moving.” There’s that clear-cut unambiguous activation step.
- 0:35: Emily notes examples of good follow-through by Ezra, Logan, and others.
- 1:02: Emily tells one student who would prefer to talk than write: “Don’t tell me, write it down.” Her tone is

---

<!-- Page 591 -->

appreciative, but she also reinforces expectations for writing.

1:19: Circulating, Emily focuses on engaging student ideas and asks questions to show she's reading carefully. At 1:50, Emily is careful to show appreciation for effort—“Nice job. Keep going.” It's especially important that the last thing students hear is the phrase “Keep going.” This ensures that her appreciation doesn't accidentally promote less follow-through.

You'll also notice that throughout there are long stretches of silence in which to think and work. Emily creates silence—she makes her expectations clear and enforces them—but also honors the silence herself. And of course after these three minutes of silent work, students will have a chance to share their ideas out loud with partners and with the rest of the room. By setting aside this time for silent writing, Emily ensures that students will have time to process and ideas to share.

**TECHNIQUE 40: FRONT THE WRITING**

In many classes, writing serves as a capstone—to a discussion, a demonstration, a lab, a presentation, or some other part of the lesson. It's often right and good and logical that writing comes last. Writing is an ideal tool for synthesizing and processing ideas. But there's also immense value when the writing comes first. *Front the Writing* is about designing lessons so that the writing happens early on.

Consider, first, two common sequences—let's call them RDW and ADW (read-discuss-write and activity-discuss-write). You might do RDW if you were reading a short story with an ambiguous ending. You might finish the last

---

<!-- Page 592 -->

paragraph and ask, “So tell me, what does the final line of the story mean? What happened and why?” A discussion might ensue, with students first making conjectures of varying types. Likely, they'd bring evidence as the details of the story's ending were discussed.

With ADW you might look at a chemical reaction or perhaps listen to a piece of music and then discuss it. What do we think is happening in the beaker and why? What do we think the composer was trying to communicate?

After those discussions you'd ask your students to write about the text they read or the activity they did. As they wrote, they'd be drawing on two sources of information: what they took from the story or the activity and what their classmates said in discussion. Ideally, a student would take his or her initial understanding from the reading or the activity and add some nuance and additional detail gleaned from discussion, but it doesn't always work that way. It especially doesn't work that way for your weakest students, with the weakest readers particularly at risk.

In many cases, students are able to use what they hear and learn in the discussion to write, convincing you that they understood the reading (or the lab experiment or a lecture) far better than they did. You might call this “piggybacking.” So while it is valuable to use a final writing exercise to assess how much your students know or to allow them to synthesize ideas, the writing in this case conflates information gleaned from two sources, one often easier to understand than the other. You (and your students) could easily get a false positive—an erroneous indication of mastery—as a result of piggybacking.

This happened to some colleagues at a school I work with. They were doing a unit in which students read *Romeo and Juliet* and strove to have a college-level discussion about it. In this case, the discussion was held in part online and via

---

<!-- Page 593 -->

chat—a fact that had the unanticipated result of allowing teachers to go back and analyze it later. As the discussion unfolded, they had cause to.

Originally my colleagues thought their unit had been a triumph. The discussions were rich and, thanks to the accountability of the chat structure, they could easily track who had participated how many times, ensuring that everyone contributed.

But as a capstone, students were asked to write a paper analyzing a passage from the play, and the papers were a stunning disappointment. You've been down this road once or twice probably. They couldn't wait to see what students wrote, but as they read each successive paper they moved from anticipation to disappointment to despondency and despair. Where had the trenchant insight and deep analysis gone? Then they realized they had a transcript of all of their discussions. They went back to look for clues. They found that the discussion was indeed full of outstanding ideas, but that, time and time again, those ideas were broached by just two students, with the rest of the class piggybacking on their breakthroughs. The class was able to reflect on a unique and powerful insight *once it was made*, but only two girls were consistently able to generate those underlying insights. They (and only they) were able to discern the germ of core conflicts and themes in Shakespeare's Elizabethan verbiage. Once they laid it out clearly, others were able to jump in. “Oh, it's about loyalty? I can speak to that!”

It's good in some ways that the ideas of these two scholars permeated the room. But it also convinced teachers that the students had greater and broader mastery of reading Shakespeare than they actually did. This was exacerbated by the fact that the teachers had had no tool to measure whether students were able to generate meaning directly

from the text. Read—or analyze a data set or do another activity—then discuss, then assess, is problematic if you want to know if students can do the first task on their own. If you want to know that, you've got to get some form of assessment before the discussion.

As students advance in their educational careers, they will increasingly find themselves in situations where they must make sense of a text or an experiment or some other key learning activity on their own—without a group of thirty colleagues with whom to distill the information and discuss first. As they mature, they will add value in professional settings by being the ones who can themselves generate ideas directly from the initial experience.

One of the simplest ways to address this is to shift the cycle from RDW to RWD or ADW to AWD and put the writing before the discussion. You still get the benefit of an exchange of ideas at the end, but not before everyone practices thinking deeply and autonomously: *What did I just see? What did it mean? How can I make sense of it?* Beyond the other benefits of writing, this also allows you to assess what students know right away, before the discussion. You can even design the discussion to respond to the initial understanding you see on their papers.

But *Front the Writing* can go a step further. It can help students get much more out of the discussion itself. Think for a minute about what we want students to do, cognitively, during the part of discussion when they are listening to their peers. We want them to listen, of course, but what else? We often tacitly (or explicitly) ask them to decide whether they agree or disagree with the speaker, but this is a bit of an oversimplification of the sort of intellectual life our students might aspire to. In the conversations of life, those whose comments focus simply on “I agree” or “I disagree” are limited. Much more

---

<!-- Page 595 -->

interesting are discussions with comments more like, “I agree that that evidence is important but I interpreted it differently,” or “The first part of your comment is insightful but I think you may have exaggerated the significance.”

Asking students to listen and focus on whether they agree or disagree can foment an unproductive situation: a discussion full of students with arms crossed saying, “Well, that's just what I think,” perhaps a little more loudly the second time around. Learning and growth aren't maximized when students are focused on proving that their original opinion was right and “winning” the discussion, rather than, say, listening for information that might cause them to change their original thought, to develop a more nuanced and flexible opinion that moderates and modulates their initial reaction in light of others’ perspectives. Surely we are exasperated when, in our lives outside of school, we come across people who want to win discussions instead of hear others out in the assumption that they might learn something. We should be careful about reinforcing that in our schools.

Next question, then: How can we socialize students to think of discussion as a tool to refine or revise their own thinking in light of the points made by others? One effective way is to ask them to write and then listen to the discussion with the understanding that the next step will be to revise their original opinion. That is, moving to RWDR or AWDR (read-write-discuss-revise or activity-write-discuss-revise) gives structure to the idea that during a discussion, what students should do is track ideas they will use to revise their opinion afterward. It makes a habit of it, in fact. The process ends with them changing their opinion. It expects them to.

This not only provides lots of practice revising—a skill I write about it in technique 42, Regular Revision, that is at

---

<!-- Page 596 -->

least as important as writing an initial idea—but also causes students to engage in the discussion with a more flexible mindset: What can I learn here, and how will I apply it to my idea? This mindset is not just theoretical—someone tells me I ought to be doing that. In practice, as a student, I am prompted, ideally over and over again, to do it with the result being that I become very good at coming up with an initial opinion, writing it down to formulate it into words, engaging in an exchange with peers in which I harvest ideas that I can weave into my own thinking, and then revising my initial opinion in writing—locking down the changes in my thinking in specific, visible words and syntax. If students could do that every day, I suspect the difference for their learning, and also for a populace prone to righteous and reflexive confidence that their opinion is assuredly the only right one, would be significant.

Below you’ll find a template we often use in our workshops to show how you might put this into practice in the classroom:

---

<!-- Page 597 -->

**Front the Writing Example in Student Work Packet**

**Everybody Writes #1:** What might the figurative language in the first and second stanza tell us about the flowers?

> **Notes from Discussion Tracker**

**Rewrite Everybody Writes #1:** What might the figurative language in the first and second stanza tell us about the flowers?

Notice the initial prompt is “formative” (see *Everybody Writes*, [technique 38](#)) and uses the word “might.” Notice also the room provided for note-taking during the discussion and the fact that the postwrite *is the same question*. You *could* change it, of course, but I like the idea that the message is that I want you to answer the same

---

<!-- Page 598 -->

question, just more insightfully. You could also add more lines beneath the prompt to suggest that you want more thinking after the discussion, but again I like the idea that it's exactly the same. The message is as much about changing what you wrote as it is adding to it. *I don't want more; I want better.* That said, subtle changes might be fine. One teacher at a workshop in London (I'm sorry I don't remember who!) noted that he would change the prompt slightly so that the first one asked *What does the figurative language in the first and second stanza tell you about the flowers?* and the second *What does the figurative language in the first and second stanza tell us about the flowers?* I like that idea—and the idea that there are lots of ways you could play with the concept of writing before and after a discussion in a disciplined way.

You can see several great examples of *Front the Writing* in two of the Keystone videos in this book. The explosion of hands two minutes into Jessica Bracey's clip is in part a result of the fact that students have all written first. So, too, the hands at the beginning of Arielle Hoo's class, when she asks them to write their conjectures. And of course at the end of Arielle's class there's a group revision in writing.

**TECHNIQUE 41: ART OF THE SENTENCE**

In *Everybody Writes* I defined two types of writing: formative and summative. Now I want to introduce a third: developmental writing, which is writing designed to build *syntactic control* though *deliberate practice*. In a moment I will define those terms, but first I want to explain why developmental writing is so important.

Not long ago I visited a highly successful school. Instruction was strong and the kids had bought in to the

---

<!-- Page 599 -->

culture. They loved being there, worked hard, and were happy; they were very successful—arguably the best school in the city it served. But the school had asked my team and me to help them think about their reading outcomes, which lagged behind the rest of their outstanding results.

I remember one English classroom in particular. Students were reading a challenging novel and paused to write about it during class. Their *Silent Solo* (technique 39) was perfect and they wrote with energy and commitment from the moment the teacher said “Go!” until she said, “OK, pencils down.” But as they wrote I walked around the room and read over students' shoulders. What I saw was an immense amount of diligent but often inchoate writing—phrases and words strove to express ideas but were not quite coherent. There would often be a nicely chosen word, an insightful phrase in the midst of a ramshackle sentence, but the pieces did not add up. The whole was almost always lesser than the sum of the parts. Students tried hard but did not produce clear ideas or arguments.

What students lacked was syntactic control, which Bruce Saddler defines as “the ability to create a variety of sentences that clearly express an intended meaning.”⁶

To master a sentence, to render unto it the power to capture a complex thought with nuance and precision, one must master a set of tools that are rarely named and even more rarely taught—in part, because we often scorn them.

The sentence in the previous paragraph, for example, required a pair of introductory prepositional phrases, the second echoing the first in vaguely appositive-like manner. It required an em dash. It required subordinating conjunctions. I had to construct a sentence in which the subject—“one,” by the way—was the twentieth word.

---

<!-- Page 600 -->

Don't try to deny it. As soon as you read the words *introductory prepositional phrases*, the music stopped and the party ended. A few readers crossed themselves reflexively at the sound of those ancient pagan words. *Oh, others thought, he's going in for “grammar.” I knew he was old school, but ...*

Grammar, as all good people know, is cruel to children. Most modern teachers will tell you that it is of limited use, the passion of ancient scolds, only faintly visible, now, in the chalk dust of time.

“For me, grammar instruction is about sentence structure,” writes Daisy Christodoulou. “It's about helping students to marshal their thoughts into coherent, logical sentences.”^7 Its purpose is syntax, and mastery of syntax remains something that we can teach joyfully and successfully without memorizing a thousand terms, like *adverbial modifier*.^8 Syntactic forms are magical tools and, happily, carefully designed writing exercises can develop them.

Coordination and subordination are good examples. When used adroitly those *ands* and *buts* and *sos* and *despites* are tools of syntax. They wander the earth humbly seeking to explain to us the ways that ideas are connected. They quietly tell us: *There are two ideas here, but one is more important than the other. Or caused the other. Or the second idea is contingent upon the other happening first. Or contrasts with the first.*

It is a superpower, when a person can coordinate and subordinate deftly and smoothly. The connections between ideas often create the lion's share of the meaning. But they are also where it all comes apart for many students, in reading as well as writing. When reading complex text, the words and phrases within a sentence may be clear enough on their own, but piecing together the interrelationships among them can still pose a problem. Your student

---

<!-- Page 601 -->

understands the idea in the first half of the sentence but misses the syntactic cue that explains its relationship to the second half. Suddenly she is lost. Readers who do not have mastery of the hidden vocabulary of syntax are always fighting a rising tide of meaninglessness. For writers who lack syntactic control, all but the simplest strands of thought resist their mastery. Precision matters because ideas are brought into being by the words that create them. Before that they are just the stuff of fog and instinct. “Language is the mother, not the handmaiden, of thought,” is how W. H. Auden expressed this idea.

*Art of the Sentence (AOS)* is the name for tools designed to teach syntactic control, happily in quite enjoyable ways and without even a whiff of sentence diagramming.

Those tools rely in part on short exercises, each with a clear goal in which students use and master specific aspects of syntactic control. Deliberate practice, if you will. You probably think students already get a ton of practice with their writing but, as Judith Hochman notes in her outstanding book *The Writing Revolution*,^9 writing gets assigned a lot but not taught a lot.

There are two things a developmental writing exercise needs to work: depth of content and scarcity. The two work together. As Judith Hochman points out, developmental writing must always be embedded in the content you are teaching. Students have to have an idea of substance to wrestle with and they have to know things connected to that idea (recall Daniel Willingham's observation that I discuss in [Chapter One](#) that higher-order thinking relies on background knowledge). When students have plenty to say about a concept and are driven to express it, you then introduce scarcity. Usually this means requiring them to write a single sentence. This causes outward pressure on the sentence—students who want to say a lot but are

---

<!-- Page 602 -->

limited to a single sentence must suddenly begin using a new and expanded version of the sentence to get it all in. Necessity is the mother of syntactical invention.

You can see this in a moment from the video of Jamila Hammet's lesson that we watched in the discussion of *Silent Solo*. Her students are reading Kate DiCamillo's *Because of Winn-Dixie*, a novel about the deep relationship between a girl and her dog. Students are asked to look at a picture of an adorable and loving dog, who reminds them of Winn-Dixie perhaps, and describe how they feel when they look at the dog. Without scarcity a student could write: “I love this dog. He's cute and I'd want to play with him. I'd want to throw him a ball and let him fetch. I'd like to see if he wants to tuck in beside me and watch a movie.”

What you might get, in other words, is what we do get so often. Relatively wooden, unimaginative writing using simple and receptive sentence construction.

But a student forced to put all their thoughts into a single sentence might write:

> I love this dog because he's so cute and I imagine us playing, me throwing him a ball to fetch or else the two of us tucked in on the couch watching a movie.

That's a sentence pushing outward on the student's limits. The student is expanding how much she can capture, and how well, in “a complete thought.” Notice all the syntactic tools that have been brought to bear—I'm honestly not sure what to call them all. Scarcity caused that—scarcity combined with students having a lot to say and ideally knowing a fair amount about a topic.

You should also expect errors to show up as students try to write more complex sentences, by the way. Of course they will. It's a good thing—they're at the edge of their mastery. Make sure to combine AOS and other developmental

---

<!-- Page 603 -->

writing exercises with technique 42, *Regular Revision*, to ensure a strong balance of exploration and accuracy.

But *Art of the Sentence* also often includes additional constraints and parameters that make the practice deliberate and cause students to focus on using specific syntactic tools. They also make the exercises even more interesting.

For example, Jamila might have asked her students to write a single sentence about the dog in the picture but begin with the phrase “Looking at the dog …” She would then cause students to practice using a sophisticated grammatical form—an introductory participial phrase. Or she could have asked them to start their sentence with: “When one looks at a dog like this …” Now she’d be causing them to use “one” as the subject. If students are going to read sentences like that, creating them intentionally can help a lot.

Or Jamila could have asked students to start “At first glance …” Now students would be using an introductory prepositional phrase, but she would also cause them to look at the picture twice. What did you not see at first that a second glance reveals?

Previously in her lesson Jamila had given students a nonfiction article to read about the history of animal-human bonds and the domestication of dogs. She could have asked students to “Write a single sentence describing how your reaction to the dog might explain some of the reasons why dogs became domesticated early on in human history. Use the word ‘bond.’ Or quote a word or phrase from the article in your sentence.”

Rules like these allow you to deliberately choose words, phrases, or grammatical forms for students to practice using. Over time students develop facility with a wide

---

<!-- Page 604 -->

range of them in their writing even if they don't know their names. As you're probably already thinking, this exposure strengthens students' ability to comprehend these sentences when they come across them while reading complex text.

## Sentence Starters and Sentence Parameters

Let's take a second to define three types of AOS sentences. The first use “sentence starters,” specific verbiage that students must use at the outset of their writing such as:

> Summarize the data from this graph in one complete well-written sentence that begins with the phrase “Over time ...”

At first glance, a prompt with a sentence starter may appear to be easier to respond to than a prompt without one because it contains scaffolding, but in many ways the opposite can be simultaneously true. The sentence is now pushed into new and often unfamiliar syntactical territory. Without being pushed and stretched in such ways, students aren't likely to expand their repertoire of syntactical forms very much. Now, imagine the different sorts of phrases with which you could ask students to begin a sentence:

- “Growing exponentially, ...”
- “The line that expresses the function ...”
- “The relationship between ...”
- “In the long run, ...”
- “When the line approaches vertical, ...”

Each of these has a different effect on student writing and thinking, pushing them not only into new syntax but potentially into new thinking.

---

<!-- Page 605 -->

Another approach you can use to guide the sentences students write is sentence parameters. These range from asking students to use a specific word or phrase (for example, “Be sure to use the phrase ‘stock character’ in your answer” or “Use the word ‘ambiguous’”) to naming a specific grammatical form: “Write a sentence using a subordinate clause with the word ‘despite’” or “Write a sentence beginning with a participial phrase.” You could also give parameters for length. “In a sentence of no more than eight words …” Or perhaps, if you wanted to go beyond the ‘rule’ of a single sentence, you could teach sentence rhythm this way: “Describe the conflict in Goya's painting *The Third of May* in two sentences of at least twelve words and one of no more than five.” I personally like word limits. An unintended consequence of using AOS tools can be the tacit reinforcement of *long* sentences—that's often an outcome of pushing one's syntactic limits. But of course while one needs to be able to construct a long and/or complex sentence, long and complex sentences are not always better. Short and sweet is often the definition of excellence. So one parameter you might occasionally use—implicit in one of the sentences in this example—is a word limit: “In a sentence of six or fewer words …”

The third kind of AOS prompts are nondemoninational. They simply ask students to capture a big idea in a single sentence with no other rules, often with a phrase like “in one carefully crafted sentence” or “in one beautiful sentence” to encourage students to take pride in the implicit challenge.

I noted that the prompt with a parameter may surprisingly be more rigorous. This is often true, but of course not always. Sometimes an open-ended prompt, such as “Describe Christopher's reaction in one artfully crafted sentence” is ideal, especially for students who have developed increasing fluidity with sentence structures. The

---

<!-- Page 606 -->

best results are likely to come, I suspect, from asking students to write a balance of sentences both with and without parameters.

Finally, one ideal place to use AOS is at the end of a lesson, given that part of its purpose is to help students synthesize and summarize. Imagine a school where every lesson in every subject ended with students writing (and revising!) a single, artfully crafted sentence capturing with nuance and sophistication the most important or challenging idea from that lesson. *Art of the Sentence*, in short, can do great service as an Exit Ticket or as the next day's Do Now. Imagine: You wrap up the lesson by having everyone distill a key idea in writing; the next day, students get their sentences back with individualized guidance, such as “Revise to use the phrase *in spite of*” or “Rewrite, clarifying what the pronoun ‘it’ refers to,” or with a challenge like “Great! Now see if you can use the word *anabolic*.”

## Art of the Sentence Meets the Little Ones

You might be wondering: is this idea feasible with my little ones? I think the answer is yes. A lovely video of Brittany Rumph with her K/1 students, *Brittany Rumph: Artful Sentence*, shows a bit of what's possible.

Notice that students draft their sentences on worksheets that frame the writing like art in a museum. Later Brittany will put many of the best up on the walls to celebrate and encourage them, but the implicit message is By writing one beautiful sentence, every single one of you is creating art with your words.

Even without that detail, you know Brittany makes a big deal of student writing. The tone of celebration is everywhere—in the way she reads great sentences aloud and does a Call and Response to put an exclamation point on one student's use of the word “magnificent.” Her

---

<!-- Page 607 -->

students' work, that of most students, is full as you might expect of invented spellings and the like. But it is also full of a capacity for complex syntax that's far ahead of what you might expect. Soon their spelling and handwriting will catch up and their syntactic control will serve them well. In Jeremiah's words, they'll be writing *juicy* sentences from the outset.

In the video *Sarah Fischler: Exhausting Six Months*, you can watch seventh-grade science teacher Sarah Fischler using AOS. My team and I love the range of prompts she uses—and the frequency, as well as the playful but practical specificity of her time limits (a great example of the effectiveness of precise time limits). Sarah's students process constantly in writing in a variety of ways and with pleasure.

# Required Reading: *The Writing Revolution*

No book is better at helping educators think about expanding students' ability to craft sentences and expand their syntactic control than Judith Hochman's *The Writing Revolution*.10 Among the highlights are the developmental writing activities she suggests. These are similar to and work in synergy with *Art of the Sentence* work. We use them regularly in our Reading Reconsidered Curriculum. Some of the best extracts:

*Because. But. So.* Take a “kernel sentence” (a short simple sentence) and expand it three times, once each time using each of the three conjunctions, *because*, *but*, and *so*. Not only does it teach a core piece of syntactic control but it causes students to think about an idea in three different ways.

*Appositives.* Expand a kernel sentence with an appositive phrase. This teaches their use, the ability to insert ideas midsentence, and causes students to expand and apply more background knowledge.

*Sentence expansion.* Take a kernel sentence and expand it with some number of *who*, *when*, *what*, *where*, and *why*.

For examples of these and other Hochman gems, please see technique 42, *Regular Revision*.

One of the benefits of developmental writing is that it teaches grammar functionally, in the service of idea creation. To that end, schools might think about a scope and sequence of developmental writing activities to teach key elements of grammar in a systematic way. Here's a

---

<!-- Page 609 -->

version of a very simple model I drafted while developing our Reading Reconsidered Curriculum:

### Developmental Writing Scope and Sequence

| Progression | Core Developmental Writing Prompts (examples use “Esperanza opened her eyes …”) |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Grade 5     | • **Combine sentences**: Esperanza opened her eyes. She had been sleeping. She dreamed that her father was with her. |
| Grade 5     | • **Expand with because, but, so**: “Esperanza opened her eyes so she saw that it had not been a dream.” |
| Grade 5     | • **Expand with after, during, before**: “Esperanza opened her eyes during a dream in which her father was still present.” |
| Grade 5     | • **Expansion (E)**: Add details explaining three to five of the Five Ws: “Esperanza opened her eyes when she woke up, feeling anxious, in her own bed.” |
| Grade 5     | • **Expand with appositives**: “Esperanza, a young girl whose father had just been killed, opened her eyes.” |
| Grade 6     | **Previous prompts plus:** |

---

<!-- Page 610 -->

## Because, But, So 2.0:

- More sophisticated versions (for example, *although*, *consequently*, *as a result of*)
- Esperanza opened her eyes although she did so only reluctantly.

## Develop with Prepositional Phrase:

- *Introductory:* “After a restless night's sleep, Esperanza opened her eyes ...”
- *Mid-sentence:* “Esperanza, in the middle of a bad dream, opened her eyes ...”

## Develop with Participial Phrase:

- *Introductory:* “Hoping it had all been a dream, Esperanza opened her eyes.”
- *Mid-sentence:* “Esperanza, dreaming of her father, opened her eyes.”

# TECHNIQUE 42: REGULAR REVISION

In the previous technique, *Art of the Sentence*, I described how short developmental writing exercises could harness the benefits of deliberate practice and help avoid a common trap for teachers—assigning a lot of writing but never managing to teach students the fundamental skills of expression or syntactic control.

---

<!-- Page 611 -->

Often, mastering syntactic tools comes as much from revision as it does from the initial act of writing. By revision, I mean the process of asking rigorous but straightforward questions about one's written idea formation: *Does that word capture exactly what I mean? Could I express my idea more precisely, perhaps with fewer words? If I change the order, how would that affect meaning? If my words are unclear, then what exactly did I mean?*¹¹

Most of us submit our own writing to the revision process frequently and, for some of us, constantly. We revise even an informal email to a colleague perhaps, or scratch out and use a different word three times when texting an explanation to a friend about running late. Revision is an everyday thing in the real world but too often a special event in the classroom—a formal activity applied mostly with compositions and longer pieces. It's often encoded in what some teachers call *the writing process*, which can take a week to complete, with each step (drafting, revising, editing) getting its own day. Over the course of the year there are perhaps three or four “revision days.”

I'd argue that to make students' writing powerful and also to allow writing to cause writers to think most deeply—to boost the Think Ratio, that is—revision should always be a part of writing. In some ways the less distinguishable as a “separate step,” the better.

The technique *Regular Revision* pursues the simple idea that we can make student writing better by making revision an everyday act, often done in short simple doses, and by making it a habit to regularly revise all manner of writing, not only formal pieces.

I find this observation of Bruce Saddler's profound: “Sentences represent vehicles of communication that are literally *miniature compositions*,” he writes. We could apply

---

<!-- Page 612 -->

the drafting and revision process reserved for longer compositions more frequently, and probably more successfully, to smaller writing exercises just by thinking of them as compositions, too. Sentence-length developmental writing exercises, for example, are perfect vehicles for revising. Small and focused, they are perfect for successful, deliberate practice.12

Skills are mastered when practiced regularly, even if practiced in smaller chunks. You might call that the Yo-Yo Ma Effect. As a child, the great cellist's father taught him to play in short, frequent, and intense doses. He played better, and with more attention, because he played shorter. The frequency of practice and the level of focus and attention involved are often more important than the duration in shaping outcomes.13 Five minutes of practice a day for ten days, done with focus and attention, will probably get you farther than an hour of practice on one occasion, even though the number of minutes applied is greater in the second instance. Doubly so if your level of attention starts to tail off at the end of the hour.

Revising smaller pieces of writing more frequently allows for focus and energy. It also allows us to have a single very specific goal for every round of practice—something the cognitive psychologist Anders Ericsson points out as being critical to accelerating learning in practice. If there's one thing to focus on and improve, it's easy to see—and then to support people as they apply that particular idea. *Let's add an active verb here.* *Let's figure out why this syntax doesn't work.* See the difference between those focused prompts and a more general “revise your paragraph?” There's a clear task to start with, so students know what to look for and to change; the task then ends with visible progress, giving students the sense of success that we discussed earlier. This will make them want to continue in the endeavor.

---

<!-- Page 613 -->

As it is now, teachers spend an immense amount of time giving students feedback on their writing. We mark up their essays with comment after comment we hope they'll read—when we return their papers in three or four weeks—and perhaps apply, at an undetermined time in the future. Often by the time they read our reams of feedback they barely remember writing the original. In addition to the time lag, there's also usually too much feedback to use. Most of it will get ignored and students will then practice ignoring feedback. I'm your student and among the fifteen suggestions you have on my three-page paper is to use more active verbs and to make my thesis statement clearer. Perhaps I'll find opportunities to use active verbs. Perhaps I won't. But usually there is no clear and immediate opportunity to even begin to try to respond and apply to this plethora of “opportunities for improvement.” Even if I wanted to try to make all of your changes, it is likely to take another month to get an opportunity.

Of course you could guarantee me the chance to rewrite my thesis by asking me to revise the whole essay but the transaction cost is high. For both of us. I rewrite the essay—as do my twenty-nine classmates on their own essays—and you're back to three weeks of dreading the stack of thirty essays staring at you accusingly from the corner of your desk.

So what if we, as teachers, applied our feedback not to writing of the largest unit size but of the smallest? What if I wrote a sentence and you suggested I rewrite it with more active verbs and I did it right then and there? Three minutes later you'd say, “Yes, much better, Doug. See how different your sentence is?” And I'd agree, because I could see that I had made a difference by making an immediate and focused change. I could look at the before and after to see the change. And then perhaps you'd say, “Try another.” Or next you might say, “Here's another one-sentence

---

<!-- Page 614 -->

composition to write. Focus on active verbs.” “Yes,” you’d say, reviewing my work only a matter of seconds after I had completed it. The feedback cycle is suddenly fast and focused and effective.

## Sentence-Level Revision Is High-Quality Practice

To maximize the benefits of practice, Ericsson suggests, the practice should first have well-defined, specific goals. “We’re working on our writing” is insufficiently vague. “We’re working on using active verbs in our writing” or “on incorporating indirect quotations into our writing” or “on starting sentences with prepositional phrases” are clear, specific goals.

We make more progress if we teach larger skills by linking a series of baby steps, aggregating smaller skills into a larger whole. For this we’ll need sentence-level practice to happen frequently. Daisy Christodoulou makes a similar point in her outstanding book, *Making Good Progress*. We presume that the best way to prepare for a task we want to assess is to assign tasks just like it over and over. But this often overwhelms students’ working memory, as cognitive load theory tells us. Students will show more mastery on the final, more complex task if they first build that mastery through practice on discrete, manageable chunks. To put it plainly, your students will write far better three-page compositions if, throughout their time with you, they have been regularly practicing writing and revising excellent sentences.

For maximum benefit, practice also requires a focused mindset and full attention, Ericsson advises. Obviously, this ability to focus is dictated in part by the vibrancy of classroom culture, but shorter activities are an ideal way to maximize the attentive capacity of students at any age. As

---

<!-- Page 615 -->

the practice pays off and students experience success, their ability to expand the duration of their attentive focus will also grow. In other words, as I write about in technique 39, *Silent Solo*, start small.

Finally, according to Ericsson, effective practice requires the giving (and use) of quality feedback from a knowledgeable source. Again, with smaller units of writing, feedback can be given more quickly and students more easily socialized to use it. And of course as they do so and see positive changes, they're likely to become more motivated and to like writing.

**Show Call: Revision's Best Friend**

To bring revision to life, teachers need a tool to make the process visible, and for that there is Show Call (technique 13). The technique is discussed extensively in Chapter Three but it also serves as a great tool for teaching revision. Show Call allows you to make the often private and individualized process of revision legible and meaningful to all the students in your classroom. That aspect is a game changer.

In many classrooms a typical “revision” exchange without Show Call might go something like this:

1. A student, Martina, reads her answer aloud.
2. The teacher says to the class, “Let's give Martina some feedback. What was effective about her answer?”
3. A classmate, working from her limited and fading memory of what Martina wrote, makes a vague observation: “She had really good details.”
4. The teacher tries to elicit a specific example to discuss: “Good. What was good about her details?”

5. The commenting student, with memory rapidly fading, tries valiantly to respond but offers an even vaguer response. “Um, I don't remember exactly; I just remember they were really good.”

This well-intentioned exchange is essentially a waste of time for both Martina and the class. If you are going to take class time to practice revision (and I certainly hope you do), then you need to make sure that both the original student author and the rest of the class (now in the role of “assistant-revisers”) are able to derive meaning from the exercise. Therefore, we need to keep the writing we are talking about in students' working memory—it must remain visible to them. *Show Call* does that, enabling a teacher to ask for precise, actionable analysis. If I project Martina's writing, I can say, “I like Martina's thesis sentence, especially her use of a strong verb like ‘devour,’” and then use the projected image to point it out for everyone. Or “I like Martina's thesis sentence, but it would be even better if she put it in the active voice. Who can show us how to do that?” This way, when we talk about what's good about a particular piece of writing, or how it can be improved, people are not just following along, but are able to actively think about the revision task. Since most of the information we take into our brains comes to us visually, students will now understand and remember the revision you are talking about far better.

Making a problem visible also allows you to ask perception-based questions. Asking a student, “Do you see any verbs we could improve on?” is far better than saying, “Amari has used a so-so verb here, let's see if we can improve it.” The former question causes students not simply to exercise the skill of improving verbs but to recognize—and practice recognizing—places where it needs doing, where writing could benefit from improvement. Without the critical step

of perceiving opportunities for revision on their own, they won't learn to write independently.

Finally, after leveraging the minds of all the students in the class and eliciting thoughts from several of them on the revision at hand, you can then create an opportunity for all students to apply the learning they've just done. “Great, now let's all go through our sentences, check the ones that are in the active voice, and revise any that are in the passive voice.” Through the use of *Show Call*, the Think Ratio and Participation Ratio on the revision task has just increased exponentially.

Incidentally, a nice way I’ve seen teachers make sure that every student learns from each revision opportunity is by doing something called an “offline rewrite.” After *Show Calling* student A’s work, provide feedback, ask the class to revise, and then *Show Call* student Z’s work to see if he or she applied the feedback as well. This ensures that everyone is accountable for applying the feedback, not just the person whose work was *Show Called*. It also gives students the time and space they need to make thoughtful revisions. This can be especially helpful for students who need additional processing time before they can effectively apply feedback.

## On Revising Writing

Here are some hints to help you make revisions as productive as possible.

Judith Hochman has observed that it is important to distinguish *editing*, which is fixing basic errors like capitalization, punctuation, and spelling, from *revising*, which is the task of improving writing—specifically by revising structure or word choice. As Hochman has pointed out, if you let students choose, they will generally edit, primarily because it is easier to add a missing capital letter

than to revise a sentence so as to use a subordinating conjunction, for example. In fact, many teachers, too, will choose editing over revising for this reason. But of course the real work is in revision.

One high-value task Hochman suggests is to ask students to add an appositive phrase to a sentence that lacks substance. In a lesson at New Dorp High School in Staten Island, a teacher began revising the sentence “Gandhi had an impact.” The teacher first asked her students to use a *Turn and Talk* to write four good appositives to describe Gandhi. Students then inserted the best appositives into the sentence so that it read, for example, “Gandhi, a pacifist and important leader, had an impact.” After the teacher asked her students to add a few more clarifications, the students came up with sentences like these: “Gandhi, a pacifist and important leader in India, had a strong impact on society.” And the best part was not so much that her students had made this sentence markedly better, it was that they were learning how to use a replicable device, the addition of an appositive phrase, to improve any sentence they might write. That’s the power of a good revision task: it teaches a replicable skill.

With thanks to Hochman for the insights that inform some of these suggestions, here are a few more high-value revision tasks:

1. Take a look at Ivan's work here. I want you to find two places where more specific technical vocabulary could make his work even better.

2. Take a look at Ivan's work here. I want you to find at least one place where he could replace a direct quotation with a partial or full paraphrase. Be ready to show us how he could write into or out of the quotation.

3. Take a look at Ivan's work here. I want you to find his two best, most dynamic verbs and then find two verbs you could upgrade to make his writing stronger.

4. Take a look at Ivan's work here. I want you to use a subordinating conjunction to add crucial information.

5. Take a look at Ivan's work here. I want you to add a phrase beginning with “but,” “because,” or “so” to improve this sentence.

6. Take a look at Ivan's work here. I want you to take these two sentences and combine them to show how the ideas connect and make your writing more fluid.

**Notes**

1. A recent study showed that background noise, especially background noise in the form of human voices, quickly reduced reading comprehension. The effect was strongest on the weakest readers. Is there any reason to think writing would be any different? See Giada Guerra et al., “Loudness and Intelligibility of Irrelevant Background Speech Differentially Hinder Children's Short Story Reading,” *Mind, Brain, and Education* (October 2020).

2. In *Motivated Teaching*. Please read this book; truly, it is excellent.

3. Meaning you won't turn it in today. Once you've got everybody going you might collect occasionally or *Show* Call or any number of things, but first you just want students writing, so reduce questions, anxieties, and distractions wherever possible.

4. Some classes obviously will be ready for this right away and will need less encouragement and can offer more

challenges, such as “Use your new vocabulary” or “Try to think of several reasons,” from the outset.

5. For more on the curriculum check out the Teach Like a Champion website:

6. I like to use a slightly adapted version of Saddler's definition: “The ability to use a variety of syntactic structures to create a variety of sentences that clearly express an intended meaning.”

8. I have no idea what the technical terms are to describe most of the elements of syntax I was using in that fancy sentence above (nor am I suggesting that fancy equals good). “Vaguely appositive-like” is certainly not a technical term. But I can use most of those tools even if I don’t know what they’re called. I have at least fair-to-middling syntactic control.

9. Did you glance lovingly at your copy of her book, placed in a seat of honor on your bookshelf, as you read that? If not, it suggests you have not read it. You should.

10. To be fair, it's great about all aspects of writing. I'm just partial to her work on sentences.

11. A story from my childhood: In fifth grade I wrote a book report. My topic sentence said the book was interesting. “You cannot write a book report in which your topic sentence calls the book interesting,” my mom said. “What kind of interesting? Why?” Back in my room I spent twenty minutes asking myself, “Well, what was so

interesting about it? Why? What word could capture that?” I rewrote my sentence four or five times to understand and express more clearly what I felt. It's possible I still got a C.

12. Much of my discussion of deliberate practice draws on the insights of the late Anders Ericsson, perhaps the foremost researcher on the idea of “deliberate practice” and the coiner of that term. I highly recommend his book *Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise*.

13. Admittedly, if you want to be Yo-Yo Ma, you'll need both.
