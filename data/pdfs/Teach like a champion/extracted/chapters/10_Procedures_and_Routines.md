# Chapter 10 Procedures and Routines

I wish everyone could have seen Sam DeLuke and Meghan Hurley's second-grade classroom at Troy Prep Elementary School on the day I visited recently. When I first walked in, I found Sam sitting in one corner, listening in on five students discussing a chapter book. As I inched closer, I overheard students making sophisticated statements like “I think you missed one piece of evidence, Zariah” and “I agree with David's point and want to develop it” (see technique 44, *Habits of Discussion*). In another corner, Meghan read a book about ants aloud to ten students who hung on every word. In the center of the room, six students sat engrossed in the pages of their independent reading, while another group had hunkered down to draft paragraphs explaining the theme of a story they had read.

A few minutes later, on Sam's cue, one of the groups from the center put their things away, stood, and walked quietly to Meghan's corner. Others, who did not transition, kept working away. Later, with a subtle gesture and without ever interrupting her instruction, she prompted a student to distribute books to peers who didn't have them.

Students in Sam and Meghan's class worked in an atmosphere of independence and self-management. Executive function is usually described as including the following sorts of skills:

- Paying attention
- Organizing, planning, and prioritizing
- Starting tasks and staying focused on them to completion

---

<!-- Page 673 -->

- Understanding different points of view
- Regulating emotions
- Self-monitoring (keeping track of what you're doing)

Students paced themselves and managed their own time. They listened carefully and drew out the best from their classmates when they worked together. The room seemed to run itself.

Paradoxically, the autonomy and self-management that were so much a part of the student experience were the products of structure and planning; students had made habits of a series of procedures Sam and Meghan had designed—how to work at your desk; how to manage materials; how to move from place to place in the room; how to ask for help if you were confused and the teacher was busy teaching others—and it was this very structure and planning, ironically, that allowed for greater autonomy. The moments when a brief reminder from Sam initiated a perfectly orchestrated transition were not in contrast to the moments when students worked at their desks with independence; they allowed them, fostered them, and made them productive.

Sam and Meghan had invested heavily in their *procedures*, which provide students with explicit guidance on how to execute recurring tasks such as working independently, transitioning between small groups, and answering questions in class. During the first few weeks of the year, they relied on constant practice to reinforce expectations. If you'd seen them then, you might not have understood where it was all leading—Why all the structure? Why all the “just so” with every little piece? Why so much focus on the *process for moving from place to place or participating in discussion*? But each of those “just so” pieces took its place within a system, a network of procedures that allowed Sam

and Meghan to teach students habits that ultimately led to more independence. Over time, these procedures became automatic, or *routine*—students could, for the most part, execute them on their own. From that point, Sam and Meghan could afford to give their students autonomy because students knew how to manage it productively and because teachers could initiate it, adjust it, or correct it with a single word or gesture.

This is an idea that is not unique to the classroom. Classroom procedures and routines like Sam and Meghan's represent essentially the intentional internalization of shared classroom habits.

And habits, it is worth noting, have a profound influence on our lives. They become keystones. You develop a healthy positive habit in your life like reading or working out and it's more likely to result in your developing others. “Typically, people who exercise start eating better and becoming more productive at work. They smoke less and show more patience with colleagues and family. They use their credit cards less frequently and say they feel less stressed. Exercise is a keystone habit that triggers widespread change,” Charles Duhigg writes in *The Power of Habit*. This sort of behavior looks like self-discipline—well, it *is* self-discipline, but self-discipline made easy. Productive habits make it easy to be productive. And this is important for students because studies find that self-discipline predicts academic performance “more robustly than ... IQ,” Duhigg writes, and has a “bigger effect on academic performance than does intellectual talent.”

This chapter is the study of the way we develop shared positive habits in the classroom. That discussion can benefit from definitions of some key terms:

---

<!-- Page 675 -->

- **Procedure:** the design a teacher establishes for the way she and her students will efficiently and productively execute a recurring task or action in the classroom.

- **System:** a network of related procedures that help teachers accomplish end goals: help students maintain an organized binder, manage behavior, move materials, participate successfully in a discussion, and so on.

- **Routine:** a procedure or system that has become automatic, which students do either without much oversight, without intentional cognition (in other words, as a habit), and/or of their own volition and without teacher prompting (for example, note-taking while reading).

In the video *Nikki Bowen: Stand Up*, originally published in the book *Great Habits, Great Readers* by Paul Bambrick-Santoyo, Aja Settles, and Juliana Worrell, you can see Nikki's impressive system for students switching literacy groups. Not only does it maximize time for learning by making transitions fast, but it ensures that students arrive at each station with minds focused and ready to learn. Within seconds they're off and running. Among other things, this is a great example of how the terms *system*, *procedure*, and *routine* intersect. Nikki's system for transitions is actually made up of a series of separate component procedures. Once students learned the procedures, practiced them, and linked them together smoothly as habit, they became a *routine*. Separating the *system* into a series of *procedures* allowed Nikki to break the learning process into chunks (in consideration of students' working memory) and to apply the chunks in other classroom systems as well. All of her classroom transitions start with “Learner's Position”—that is, students showing they are attentive and ready—and the process of

When these become automatic

My goal in this chapter is to pull back the curtain a bit and reveal the ways in which teachers like Nikki, Sam, and Meghan use procedures and routines to create rigorous, joyful, and orderly classrooms that grant students real independence. At the beginning of the chapter we’ll look specifically at two familiar and important routines that are linked to form a system for the beginning of class: *Threshold and Strong Start*. After that, we’ll study *Habits of Attention*, which is a routine for basic social interactions by and among students during learning. But of course a great classroom has far more procedures and routines than that, so afterwards, we’ll explore the “how” behind designing and installing procedures and routines so that you can set up students for success in your classroom and beyond.

That said, it’s also important to note how many examples of procedures and routines are described *elsewhere* in this

---

<!-- Page 677 -->

book. Doing so can also help us glimpse the range in types of systems you can include in your classroom.

There are three broad categories of Procedures and Routines:

1. **Academic Routines**: Help students complete tasks they engage in as part of the learning process. Elsewhere in the book you will find myriad examples of such routines. *Turn and Talk* is essentially a routine for peer-to-peer conversations. *Habits of Discussion* are a set of procedures for use and adaptation during larger discussions. *Silent Solo* is a routine for making independent writing happen smoothly and universally among students. *FASE Reading* is a tool for making a productive routine out of student oral reading. *Show Me* is a routine—or a group of routines—that allow you to check student work simply and easily. All of these live and die by the effectiveness of implementation. So, in the end, all your *Means of Participation*—*Cold Call*, *Show Call*, and *Call and Response*—work if they are predictable routines in which when you call on students, they expect you might do it, understand the spirit in which it's done, and know how to respond.

2. **Procedural Routines**: Help students manage materials and get from one place to another while maximizing efficiency. There are a dozen routines you could install to make the mundane logistics of the classroom work more smoothly: lining up at the doorway, passing out and collecting papers, moving to the carpet for little ones, getting out materials. In this chapter I'll discuss two such routines: *Threshold* and *Strong Start* for beginning class. They may seem mundane, but after reading about them I hope you will see their profound importance. But there are more elsewhere—*All Hands*, in Chapter Six, for example.

---

<!-- Page 678 -->

3. **Cultural Routines**: Help students express shared values, norms, and aspirations. Perhaps you noticed in Jessica Bracey's or Denarius Frazier's classroom how students praise each other for effort or quality thinking, either when the teacher suggests it or of their own volition (see also the video *John Bogard: Go to IP*). Perhaps you are aware of how some teachers socialize their students to “send magic” to a peer who is temporarily stuck while trying to answer a question. In place of calling out, they make a gesture that says: *I support you; I know you'll get it.* The first among these by far is *Habits of Attention* and its importance is captured in this photograph:

This is Jessica's student, Omar, answering her question about the protagonist's motivation in the novel they're reading. He's a tiny bit nervous at first. Does he have it right? Has he said it well? Is it safe to share? But he answers at length—he keeps going, giving more detail and opinion and gathering confidence. In part he does this because of the social routine you can see here: his peers

---

<!-- Page 679 -->

looking at him and affirming that they are listening and that his words matter.

It's worth noting also that teachers' own routines are a critical part of a successful classroom. **Chapter Two** is really a study of preparation procedures that hopefully become routine. How you circulate and observe for data are other examples of critical teacher-facing routines.

A word about the collective power of routines before we push on: Let's say everyone in your class had their own routine for getting their materials out and could complete the process in a few seconds. Would it be just as good as a shared routine where everyone does it the same way? Better even? Everyone accomplishing the same task in the same handful of seconds, each by doing it their own way sounds a lot more compelling. Why, this is to say, do routines have to be collective?

The first reason is that it makes them easy to support and manage. It's a long shot that everyone could find their own way to do that same thing—you'd be unlikely to get the outcome you wanted—but even if they did you'd be hard-pressed to help a student who struggled without steps to guide him through, even with the understanding that there was a right way to do it. You'll need to make sure your notebook is in your desk every morning when you unpack as opposed to asking, *Well where do you usually like to keep your notebook, in your backpack or in your desk?* As the epically disorganized child who was the one least likely to figure out the right way in middle school, I can also tell you that I was among the least likely to take anyone's guidance on how to be more productive. I didn't get it and so I didn't see the wisdom of, and was resistant to, what people were trying to tell me.

And of course group productivity requires coordination. You can move from chair to desk any way you want when

---

<!-- Page 680 -->

you're the only one in the room. When thirty people are doing it at the same time, the only way to avoid unnecessary collisions or negotiated settlements over who will transition first down this row or that column is to organize it.

A second reason for coordination is that clear procedures and routines are extremely effective at norm setting: “When we are uncertain of how to behave,” Tom Bennett writes, “we look to other people as a safe guide of what to do. This is called social proof, a term coined by Cialdini in 1984. By seeing what others do, we have ‘proof’ that it’s the right thing.” A clear norm not only encourages people to follow, but often gives them comfort. It reduces the anxiety many students feel that they might do the wrong thing and look foolish. As the video *Nicole Warren: Keystone* reveals, Nicole's class is full of routines her students know well. This helps her create a sense of flow and momentum that enhances motivation. There's an unbroken flow of energy. But notice also how happy her students are to know exactly what to do, to see others around them doing the same, and to join with them. To return to a point I made in Chapter Seven, Zaretta Hammond calls the brain “a social organ,” and notes that it “has a ‘contact’ urge, a ‘desire to be with other people.’” This is often reflected in the universality and power of singing—in every culture in the world, singing together is a way of becoming a part of a unified group collective, literally and symbolically. We join our voices—in worship or otherwise—and the emotions of doing so are surprisingly profound. Part of it is the music and part of it is the certainty of belonging created by the coordination. It can be overdone and misused, of course, but it's also profound and elemental. Tom Bennett writes of the psychological benefits of the “collective sensation of being part of a large group sharing goals and activities.”[^1] It reminds students

---

<!-- Page 681 -->

that they belong. Far from being militaristic and soulless, managed properly, executed with a pinch of happiness or even joy, and invested with meaning by a teacher, shared routines are often comforting.

A third reason collective routines are powerful is that, ironically, they help us focus our cognition where it is more useful. Having a habit for how to write a midstream response to a novel—what I call Stop and Jot in the *Everybody Writes* section—sets students free to write more and better since their minds are on the book and not where to write and whether to use pencil or pen. Similarly, making a habit of doing something productive makes it easy to do and lets you save willpower and self-discipline for other things. This is in part a hidden story of schooling. Success relies on a lot of things but one of them is getting all your tasks and assignments completed, on time and whether or not you particularly feel like it that day. When scientists analyze people who appear to have the greatest amounts of self-discipline, James Clear writes, it turns out they are actually better at “structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control.”² They have better habits and make productive behaviors automatic. They don't need to draw on self-discipline to take care of daily habits because their routines and habits do that. Advising individuals in how to change their lives for the better, Clear essentially describes a high-performing classroom with strong procedures and routines. “One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.... Your culture sets your expectations for what is ‘normal.’ Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want.... You'll rise together.”³

Classroom procedures and routines, in other words, which are really shared habits, carefully designed by a loving adult, are critical to almost every goal we seek in schools.

# TECHNIQUE 47: THRESHOLD AND STRONG START

People constantly read environments and take social cues from them, and this process starts within seconds of entering a space. Less than that, actually. We form many of our impressions and opinions almost instantaneously, Jonathan Haidt explains in *The Righteous Mind*, often creating logical explanations for our responses only later. Like so much of our behavior, this process is hidden from us—we are not aware that we do it, but we do it just the same. The “we” in this statement includes your students.

Their first impressions matter, not just on the first day of school, but every day, and so how class begins—and in fact how culture and expectations are communicated in the ambiguous and liminal time *before* class has begun—is critical in setting norms, communicating culture. How you choose to greet students when they cross the threshold of your doorway communicates to students what is likely to happen when they enter your classroom, and what people expect to happen is much more likely to come about. With culture, getting it right and keeping it right are much easier than fixing it once it goes wrong. *Threshold* ensures that you make a habit of getting it right at the start of each day.

Students' arrival in the classroom should result in their receiving the message that they belong; that their teacher is prepared and capable; and that as learners their time will be well spent. It's also important to offer a subtle reminder that expectations in your classroom are elevated over what they are in the hallway or any other space. What happens in your classroom is more important, and a subtle shift should happen when students enter, not unlike what the great majority of people do upon entering a church,

---

<!-- Page 683 -->

mosque, or synagogue—they will drop their voices and change the tenor of their interactions to reflect the dignity of the space. Their actions say, *What happens here is important*. No one tells them to make this change. They read it in the cues offered by the environment and the way others around them act. A classroom is not a house of worship—we don't want a shift to the same culture you'd see there—what we want is a shift, a recognition that the students are entering a place of shared value and heightened importance.

With that in mind, watch the first moments in the classrooms of Sadie McCleary, Darren Hollingsworth, Trona Cenac, Steve Chiger, and Tamesha McGuire, all of which are different and yet in a way similar. Each communicates different cultures, but they communicate and reinforce culture clearly. They use different routines but signal that this place you are entering will be a productive learning space. We are watching teachers who are all *culture shapers* rather than *culture takers*.

Start with *Darren Hollingsworth: Smart. Smart!* How could you not start with Darren? We can't see him at the outset, but we can hear him greeting students in the hallway: “Look at this! Smart. Smart!⁴ Describing his students generally and a few individuals, he says, “Super smart.” He's upbeat and irrepressible but also confident and absolutely clear in his mind on what is supposed to happen when students enter his room. He greets students by name, communicating that they are known and important, but as they enter there's a clear task to follow through on (“My group, go straight in. Equipment out, ladies and gents!”) and students follow along with clear expectations, setting the norm for a happy and productive start to class. This soon becomes routine. It's how class starts with Mr. Hollingsworth. Students will feel known and included and also expect to have their time well spent.

---

<!-- Page 684 -->

Note something that will become a theme. Darren is positioned at the point of entry where he can clearly see his room and also greet every student. There's no other way in, and this allows him to slow the flow into the room and if need be to remind students of elevated expectations. He does this, in fact, pausing the line briefly because it isn't tidy enough. He playfully calls it a rabble—it clearly isn't—but students fix their already productive behavior to make it even better. Joy, inclusion, and high expectations are successfully messaged.

In *Sadie McCleary: Grab One of Each*, Sadie is perhaps slightly less ebullient but no less warm, genuine, and gracious as she greets her students. There are little moments of dialogue—“Hi, N'Kaye. Nice to see you,” “Hi, Alexa,” and “I like your glasses”—and reminders about materials so everyone has what they need from the outset. “Grab one of each [there are two handouts by the door] and a calculator if you need one.” There are also minor reminders of elevated expectation: “Cell phones away, please,” she tells one student. Students take the Do Now from the basket, proceed to their desks, and start working. It's a topsy-turvy morning for Sadie because there are cameras recording the class and not everyone has signed a permission to be filmed, so during the *Threshold* she's also shuffling students around to put them in unfamiliar seats (with some out of view of the camera) but all of this goes remarkably smoothly because everyone knows what to do and because she appears at the door signaling organization and preparedness and expectation. Students feel seen and cared about but also get down to work quickly. The *Threshold* might seem like downtime, in other words, but it's not. One student lingers a little too long talking about something that's best dealt with later (“Let me come to help you with that in a second,” Sadie says). This time is actually crucial in setting expectations. It's not downtime for Sadie.

---

<!-- Page 685 -->

Notice some of the similarities in Darren and Sadie's technique. They both stand in the doorway where they can control the flow of students into the room, even though Sadie's students arrive episodically and don't line up outside the door. She takes the opportunity to both set a warm, gracious tone and remind students in simple ways that when they enter the classroom the expectations are different, elevated—what we do here matters deeply. Great teachers often combine these minor resets and reminders with warm and gracious, “I see you” moments—“Love the new glasses,” “Good to see you,” “How'd the debate go?”—seizing on many opportunities to use students' names. All of this builds relationships by making students feel “known” (part of the *safe, successful, and known* recipe my colleague Dan Cotton framed).

Trona (*Trona Cenac: It's Gonna Be Fine*) is greeting her students at the beginning of the year. They've had various adventures and have much to tell her. There's excitement and good feeling, but she also channels this into the first tasks. The message is: *It's great to see you; I care about you and also, we have a lot to do and here's how to get started.* She's a little more explicit about the daily expectations because it's early in the year. Like Darren and Sadie, she's at the narrow point in the threshold so she can control the flow into the classroom. And Trona makes sure she can maintain her vision of the classroom as well as the hallway as students enter. You'll notice how much of the work she does outside the room. If you can do this, it's smart, because habits are powerful. It means that the classroom is your space and students never see it in any way other than as you wish it. Therefore the process of entering and shifting slightly in demeanor becomes a matter of habit.

Steve Chiger applies similar ideas (*Steve Chiger: Knowing What to Do*). He greets students warmly but simply by

---

<!-- Page 686 -->

name and seems upbeat about the class, and even though students are very attentive, also pauses the process of entry ever so briefly because he “thought he heard something.” Afterwards you can see students productively engage in their entry routine. He’s signaled expectations and elevated the importance of the space, and students react accordingly.

Tamesha McGuire shows a slightly different setting (Tamesha McGuire: Tuck Your Chair). She’s already in the room chatting amiably and lovingly with her boys and getting ready for her lesson when the girls, who’ve been elsewhere, enter. She claps twice and shifts her tone to show that class has started now, and her girls know instantly that they’ve entered a space of elevated importance. She’s actually not at the door, but it’s a Threshold, nonetheless.

The themes thus far include greeting your students by standing in the physical threshold of the classroom when possible—astride the door, taking the opportunity to remind students where they are (they are with you now, and no matter what the expectations elsewhere, you will always expect their best), how you feel toward them (caring, warm, but also with a hint that strictness can emerge as needed), and what you will expect of them (excellence, scholarship, and effort). During this routine, each student who enters greets you, shakes your hand, looks you in the eye, and offers a civil and cordial greeting, and vice versa. It’s a ritual of courtesy and caring.

You can use the greeting to engage students briefly and build rapport: “Loved your homework, David”; “Nice game last night, Shayna”; “Looking for great things from you today, Mr. Williams!”; “Your hair looks great, Shanice!” You won’t have time to say something like this to every student, but you can pick a few each day, over time connecting with

---

<!-- Page 687 -->

each student and reminding them all that you know them as individuals. You can also build rapport while reinforcing expectations for *Threshold* by warmly acknowledging students with strong greetings: “Nice strong shake, Jamal”; “I love the enthusiasm, Terry.”

You can also welcome students with a description of what's to come and a reminder of what's expected: “We have a quiz today. Better use that *Do Now* to get ready.” You should also use *Threshold* to set expectations by correcting weak handshakes, untidy attire, apathetic greetings, or poor eye contact. Fortunately, this is easy to do because *Threshold* has a built-in consequence. Get it wrong, and if necessary you go back and try it again.

When you stand at the doorway, position yourself to see *both sides* so that you can maintain visibility of students who have already entered your classroom as well as those you're greeting. Once they enter, narrate a bit of positive behavior: “Thanks for getting *right* to work”; “Good work, Jamila. Appreciate you getting that homework *right* out.” If you notice that several students in class are not meeting expectations, you can warmly remind them of what they should be doing: “Make sure those chairs are tucked in so that everyone can get by,” or “Remember, we enter with ‘voices off.’”

If it's not possible for you to greet students at the door (either for school policy reasons or because you float to classrooms), invent another ritual to signify the start of something formal, as Tamesha does. What matters is that you use the power of ritual to help students see, from the moment they enter your classroom, that it is different from the other places they go.

For busy teachers, the time just after students have entered class—while they're walking in, getting seated, and hopefully working on a *Do Now*—can sometimes be a bit of

---

<!-- Page 688 -->

an afterthought. Some use it to complete clerical tasks—stapling packets, organizing instructional materials, writing lesson objectives on the board, or briefly collecting their thoughts. In their eyes, the opening minutes of class are ideal for preparing for a lesson that won't begin until they start delivering new content.

Of course there are times when you have to grab a minute to attend to some task, but it's important to recognize that every lesson begins as soon as students walk through the door. Two minutes at this point counts just as much in terms of potential learning as two minutes during the heart of your lesson and, of course, you and your classroom norms are still communicating to students *Here's what to do here; here's what to expect.*

So it's worth being intentional about the start of class, planning a most efficient *right* way for students to enter the classroom, complete the *Do Now*, get their learning materials ready, and transition to the heart of the lesson—and then making a consistent habit of it for every student. When that happens, once it's a routine, it's a win-win situation. Students are productive, you're productive, and with everything moving with tidy efficiency you're actually more likely to get time to review your lesson, tidy the room, catch up with individual students, and just maybe have a sip of coffee.

**Strong Start**

*Strong Start* is about designing the sequence of events in the classroom from the moment students enter the room, presumably after your Threshold, until the heart of the lesson begins. It’s critical for three reasons:

1. It sets the tone for everything that comes after.  
   Classroom culture is not static from day to day. It is

---

<!-- Page 689 -->

shaped by the opening minutes of a lesson—whether you intentionally engineer them or not.

2. From a *pacing* perspective, a strong, energetic start to your lesson builds momentum. It socializes students to work with discipline, urgency, and efficiency as soon as they walk through the door. Get off to a slow start, and you could find yourself spending the rest of your lesson fighting to rebuild momentum you lost and may never win back.

3. *Strong Start* usually includes a Do Now, which sets the table for mastery by efficiently previewing or reviewing high-quality content students need to master. It builds the academic habits students will need to succeed.

If you stepped inside a highly successful classroom shortly after the bell rang, you would probably find that you could divide the routine students use to start the lesson into three parts: (1) from door to *Do Now*, (2) *Do Now*, and (3) review of the *Do Now*.

The first component of *Strong Start* comprises how students get from the door to their *Do Now*. Unlike *Threshold*, which immediately precedes students' entry into the room and focuses on setting behavioral norms and expectations, from the door to *Do Now* is about making a habit out of what's efficient, productive, and scholarly as students take their seats.

A typical arrangement might look something like this: as soon as students cross the threshold of the classroom door, they pick up a packet of materials from a table or counter just inside as Sadie McCleary does. In some cases, especially at the elementary grades, packets might already be at students' desks. You can see that Christine Torres has done this at the outset of her lesson in the video *Christine Torres: Silently to Your Seats*.

---

<!-- Page 690 -->

A bit of warm and appreciative affirmation like Christine's lets students know you value their efforts. “Thanks for getting *right* to work, James,” “Lindsay is already answering question number one on the *Do Now*,” and the like). Discipline your narration so that it's pithy and precise, and quietly reinforces industrious behavior. Once the opening procedures become routine, use narration with diminished frequency. The goal is to get to a point where you need to say very little—if anything—to set your door to *Do Now* routine in motion. When Christine offers her appreciation, comments are carefully spaced and there's lots of quiet think time. She wants to avoid making her affirmations feel mechanical—this can happen if there are too many and they sound repetitive—and wants to be sure to create a working environment where students can be productive and not have their thinking interrupted.

A couple of key points maximize the effectiveness of the door to *Do Now*:

- It's more efficient to have students pick up their packets from a table than it is for you to try to hand the packets to them at the door. The latter approach slows you down and forces you to multitask when your mind should be on setting expectations and building relationships.

- Students should know where to sit. Time spent milling around, looking for a seat, deciding where to sit, or talking about deciding where to sit (“Can I sit next to him? Will he think I’m flirting?”) is a waste of learning time and energy. Assign seats or allow students to sign up for regular seats.

- Whatever students need to do with homework (put it in a basket, place it on the front left corner of their desk, pass it to a proctor), they should do the same way every

---

<!-- Page 691 -->

day without prompting. This lets you collect it seamlessly, and collecting it at the start of every class tacitly underscores its importance.

- Put your *Do Now* (the second part of this routine) in the same place every day: on the board, on an interactive handout, or in the packet. The objectives for the lesson, the agenda, and the homework for the coming evening should be on the board already, also in the same predictable place every day.

As part of *Strong Start*, establishing the routine of the *Do Now* is critical. A *Do Now* enables you to maximize instructional time, build industrious habits, and make use of a discrete block of time when your students can practice and thus sustain and build their proficiency with skills they've already mastered. This issue—making sure students don't lose through disuse what they'd once mastered—is one of the hidden challenges of teaching.

I discuss the details of an effective *Do Now* in technique 20.

## TECHNIQUE 48: HABITS OF ATTENTION

“What few people ever appreciate is how central attention is for every function we perform,” writes reading researcher Maryanne Wolf. “What we attend to is ultimately what we learn,” concurs Peps Mccrea. It is the unheralded “gatekeeper” of learning. The ability to sustain focus and concentration is the unacknowledged source of many students' success, and the inability to attend is the undoing of others.

“Neuroscience reminds us that before we can be motivated to learn what is in front of us, we must pay attention to it,” says Zaretta Hammond. “The hallmark of an independent

---

<!-- Page 692 -->

learner is his ability to direct his attention toward his own leaning.”⁵ To build strong attentional habits is to give students stewardship of their own thinking.

*Selective attention* is the term for the ability to select what you pay attention to—to lock out distractions and lock in on the task at hand. It has “reverberating effects” on success in language, literacy, and mathematics, note cognitive scientists Courtney Stevens and Daphne Bavelier. They add that there are potentially “large benefits to incorporating attention-training activities into the school context.”⁶

If young people can build habits of sustained selective attention, their likelihood of success is higher. This has always been true but is magnified today when much of our universe—the online portion of it—is designed to fragment our attention and draw it to where it can be marketed and sold.

The technique *Habits of Attention* seeks to establish routines that cause students to focus their attention during class and build stronger attentional habits. In addition, it seeks to use the signals people send when they attend to someone else to build a stronger, more inclusive learning community.

I used to call the technique STAR/SLANT after the acronyms that schools often used to describe its component expectations in the classroom. I still suggest the use of an acronym to describe core attentional habits, but I’ve changed the name and the description to focus more on *why*. Understand the purpose of the technique and you are far more likely to use it effectively.

The “habits” in the technique focus in particular on eye-tracking and pro-social body language—language that communicates support for, and the belonging of, speakers. It may be helpful, before reading more, to watch these

things in action in a classroom. I suggest you do so in two parts, first watching Christine Torres's Keystone video, which shows two broad segments of her lesson, as she first teaches new vocabulary words and then leads a discussion of Lois Lowry's novel *Number the Stars*. Christine's students, I think you will agree, are unusually engaged and attentive: They enthusiastically wrestle with new words and are cerebral, respectful, and attentive in discussing a difficult question. Next watch the video *Christine Torres: Habits of Attention Outtakes* to see a montage of moments extracted from this lesson. Note how important it is that students look at one another, how their body language shows classmates that they belong and their ideas are welcome. Note how attentive, confident, and productive they are as a result.

“Visual cues,” writes James Clear in *Atomic Habits*, “are the greatest catalyst of our behavior. Where we look shapes our attention more than any single factor.”^7 We are often not fully intentional or even conscious of where we look and why, however, so shaping students' habits of looking can lead to a profound change, not only in their actions and cognition, but in those around them. For example, engaging in behaviors that show a speaker that you are listening carefully—nodding, for example, and looking interested—are often self-actualizing. They cause you to pay better attention and cause the speaker to feel a strong sense of affirmation and belonging as well. Note therefore how often—and how deftly—Christine reinforces these things.

There is a strong connection between such behaviors and our ability to build community in the classroom. Belonging^8 is arguably the most powerful motivator there is. Our unconscious brains are “obsessed with it” writes Daniel Coyle in his book, *The Culture Code*, but he adds that the brain “needs to be continually fed by signals of safe connection.” Surveying the research, he notes that

---

<!-- Page 694 -->

“Posture and expression are incredibly important. It's the way we prove we are in synch with someone.” However, “a mere hint of belonging is not enough … we are built to require lots of signaling, over and over.”

You can see this happening in Christine's classroom. Her students are constantly signaling to one another that they belong. They turn and face each other. They nod, react, and encourage. And this signal is strongest when their classmates are sharing important ideas. There is a risk that every student takes in raising their hand. To raise your hand and say something truthful in front of a group of peers is to risk failure or, worse, judgment by them. Yes, your answer could be disastrously wrong, but even worse, your classmates' nonverbal response could say: None of us could care less about what you just said or Oh, wait, did you say something? I barely even noticed or please tell me you didn't just make a comment about the book. If that is the case, only a rare student will raise her hand.9 The learning journey is forestalled when students must risk social transgression to embark upon it. “Regardless of how strong the logic of your pep talk,” Peps Mccrea writes, “few pupils will ask more questions in class if they sense it will result in being mocked by their mates.”

But in Christine's classroom, to raise your hand and to begin to formulate a thought is to bask in the warm glow of acceptance and encouragement. The culture in her classroom does not just allow students to take this necessary risk, it lovingly draws them into the light. It is profound and beautiful—a gift to young people, and most of all to the hesitant and reluctant. But what you see in her classroom is not something that will happen naturally, among any group of people, unless the teacher intentionally builds it.

---

<!-- Page 695 -->

There are people who will tell you that building such culture is coercive and repressive, and sometimes that this is “controlling Black and Brown bodies.” I hope this discussion will make it clear that this is a not the case.^10 To ask students to be attentive to their bodies is to *create* opportunities for their minds and spirits; to help them build habits that help them focus is to help them harness the power of their thinking. When classmates intentionally signal belonging and encouragement to one another, they release them from invisible barriers that constrain them, barriers that for some students will exist in the majority of classrooms they will enter in their lives. To shape these signals is to give students power and community in place of dependence and isolation.

Eye contact and body language are the means we use to show someone that they matter and belong. Understanding our evolution as a species can help us to understand why.

Let's start with our eyes, which have a white outer portion called the sclera. In all of the other primates, the area surrounding the pupil is dark and as a result you cannot clearly track eye movements. Scientists explain this singular aspect of human evolution via the Cooperative Eye Hypothesis. Humans act with a level of cooperation unseen in the mammal kingdom. As a species we survived because of this unequalled ability (and desire) to coordinate and collaborate. For most of evolutionary history to be cast out of the group was certain death. Our eyes have adapted to look the way they do because the information contained in the gaze of our peers—Am I accepted and respected? What is my status? Do I belong?—is central to survival. “For hundreds of thousands of years, we needed ways to develop cohesion because we depended so much on each other. We used signals long before we used language,” says Alex Pentland of the MIT Human Dynamics Lab.^11 Our physiology is designed to communicate these signals and

---

<!-- Page 696 -->

we are profoundly sensitive to what is told in our peers' eyes— even if we are often unconscious of it.

“Belonging feels like it happens from the inside out,” summarizes Coyle, “but in fact it happens from the outside in.” Students in Christine's classroom feel like they belong because their peers are signaling to them that they belong —and that they *still* belong—just possibly they *especially* belong—when and if they participate in learning.

The original version of this technique—and its name—referred to acronyms such as SLANT, which several outstanding schools used to articulate the signals of belonging and attentiveness that people use when in groups:

**Sit up**  
**Listen**  
**Ask and answer questions**  
**Nod your head**  
**Track the speaker**

Especially crucial elements from that list were tracking the speaker—that is, following the person talking with your eyes—and sitting up—you don't learn well if you are slouched, or at all if you have your head down on your desk, and allowing yourself to check out physically causes you to check out mentally. If we care about young people, if we believe their learning and their futures are important, we can't allow them to simply opt out of attending to learning.

Handy acronyms such as SLANT allow teachers to explain and reinforce the component behaviors: “Don't forget to SLANT” or “Check your S” (that is, make sure you're sitting up); “Please track Guadeloupe while she shares her

---

<!-- Page 697 -->

answer.” Or simply calling on Guadeloupe by saying “Track Guadeloupe, please.” But there can be challenges with these acronyms. First, they focus on the action without always fully describing its purpose and a good thing can easily become distorted when the purpose isn't clear. The component parts of SLANT, for example, are easy to manage and so teachers—perhaps a struggling teacher for whom an orderly classroom has been elusive—can lock in on the behavior without pursuing its purpose.

An additional challenge can be that managing attention behaviors can prove successful enough that it can lead to a spread in managing behaviors less clearly tied to attention: hands folded on the desk; back flat against the chair, and so forth. To be clear, these behaviors are not something I've discussed in *Teach Like a Champion*, but I have certainly seen classrooms where they are reinforced in a counterproductive way and sometimes in the belief that this book endorses them. Reminding students who are at risk of becoming distracted—or who are sending unsupportive messages to peers—to Track or SLANT can be useful; telling students to keep their feet flat on the floor or interrupting them when they are productively engaged in a discussion to tell them to fold their hands on the desk is not.12 What if they want to take notes?

*Habits of Attention* also implies asking students to track us as teachers at times. There are people who will tell you this, too, is a form of tyranny, but telling children they needn't pay attention to adults is a cheap version of freedom to trade an education for. “When parents asked me why their students should have to track me when I spoke, I explained, ‘If I can't see your son's eyes I don't know if he heard. I don't know if he will be able to complete the learning task,’ my colleague Darryl Williams says of his school leadership days. “I explained it from an equity perspective. One of the reasons we get students’ attention

---

<!-- Page 698 -->

is to give them the opportunity to be successful at a task.” That’s an educator who is clear on his purpose and who understands what supports autonomy for young people.

To address these challenges, I’m going to propose what I think is a better acronym—with the caveat that I think each school or classroom should reflect individually on any acronym they choose. Are these the tools we think will build positive attention habits in our students? If students work hard and meet these expectations, will it improve their ability to learn in a positive way? The answer must be yes, or the expectations are not worth including. But if the answer is yes, you should not shrink from including them.

With all of that in mind, it’s clear that there’s information we can add to descriptions of attention habits to provide more consistent reminders to teachers and students about their purpose. Consider the “N” in SLANT, that is, nodding your head. This not only shows interest in another person’s ideas, it also causes you to engage actively in listening. Here is an updated list for *Habits of Attention*, with the acronym STAR, revised to emphasize purpose more clearly:

- **Sit up** to look interested and stay engaged.
- **Track the speaker** to show other people their ideas matter.
- **Appreciate your classmates' ideas** by nodding, smiling, and so on when they speak.
- **Rephrase the words of the person who spoke** before you so they know you were listening.

In this acronym you can see I’ve added details about purpose. Nodding is included in the “appreciate” step to emphasize the importance of appreciating your classmates. That said, you might replace the “Appreciate” A with an A called “Active listening” (to help you focus and show that

---

<!-- Page 699 -->

you value your classmates). “Sit up” includes a purpose as well, so you *look interested and engaged*. You’ll also notice that I’ve brought in an idea from the *Habits of Discussion* technique, “rephrasing,” but you could drop it if you wanted, perhaps replacing it with something else. Again, I am describing options here because the behaviors described in any acronym (and the expectations) should be carefully thought through at the school or classroom level. My version of STAR may be helpful, but the adaptations you make to it will make it even better.

There’s one other piece that’s needed, though. *Habits of Attention* only work if they become *habits*. You can see how important this is to Christine Torres. Her classroom culture is strong—exceptional, you might argue. It’s warm and encouraging and inclusive of all. It’s fun and funny and scholarly. And yet, she is still shaping and reinforcing and lovingly correcting for *Habits of Attention* all the way through. She strikes a careful balance. If you have to explain and remind every time you want eye contact to validate a speaker, then it will become a constant disruption to the conversation you are trying to honor. But just because things are going well does not mean she forgets about maintaining the environment. She reinforces it lovingly, early, and often with a hint of humor so her reminders are gentle. Having an acronym helps her because it allows for easy abbreviated reminders.

Some details to notice from Christine’s class:
- Frequently she reminds students to track in advance via the language she uses to call on a student, as in segment 1: “What did the girl do in the situation? Track, Etani …”
- Occasionally she narrates the positive to make the norm more visible, as in segment 2: “Track, Azariah.”

---

<!-- Page 700 -->

Jada's tracking; Juju's tracking." Once she reminds a student to reciprocate the signal—to turn and face his classmates as they are tracking him. Other times she reminds students indirectly and playfully as in segment 4: “Ooh, Jasmine, girl, wait until you have all eyes.”

- You can also see habits in formation. Notice how, without her asking students to, students turn and engage face-to-face and expressively in their *Turn and Talk*. Many a teacher can tell you tales of flat affect and disinterest expressed in pair conversations, but not in Christine's class.

- The culture carries over, too, in the moment when she calls on Nate without asking for tracking … still his classmates turn to face him. The signal of belonging is loud and clear.

- The montage ends with Christine asking for students to track her. She's giving them a key piece of information. It's critical that they hear and attend. By asking for tracking she signals the extra importance of the moment. Students lock in and, without her asking them to, adjust their own posture.

That said, even a well-established routine is a default—understood as the base condition but a condition that can be changed or turned off. I witnessed an example of this in Torian Black's history class at Freedom Prep in Memphis one morning not too long ago.

During his lesson he gave students a variety of reading and writing tasks to complete in groups. The tasks were complex and afforded students a significant amount of autonomy, so it was important that they listen carefully and get the directions right. His gentle reminders to “make sure you're listening” were accompanied by a warm and gracious smile. This not only communicated trust and

---

<!-- Page 701 -->

caring but confidence. As a result, things were pretty crisp and class time was spent on the activities as planned.

But here was my favorite part. As he reviewed a portion of the directions, Torian said, “No need to track me; you can just read along on the page in front of you.”

Later he summarized the directions and used that phrase again in a warm and quiet voice, “No need to track me.” So students read along.

I love that phrase … “No need to track me.” It does several things at once.

First, it reminds students that there is an intact expectation in the classroom that listeners track speakers. But it also shows intentionality on Torian's part. A really useful rule of thumb for managing a classroom is *Because you can does not mean you must*. Could Torian enforce the expectation that students track him while he gave direction? Yes. Must he? No. And in fact he wanted them reading the directions, not looking at him in this case. Or perhaps he wanted to give them an inch of extra flexibility because they were so on-point. He gave them permission not to follow the default while reminding them that it was still the default—a perfect and elegant way to prevent ambiguity. But he also reminded them that the lack of tracking was intentional and not an accident. The system and the exception coexisted happily and his phrase allowed Torian to turn off the tracking default temporarily while reinforcing it as an expectation.

Let's close then with two examples of what classrooms with strong *Habits of Attention* look like. First, check out the Keystone video of BreOnna Tindall's classroom. Her students look at each other as they share their thoughts about *The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass*. You can feel their confidence as their ideas are validated by the

---

<!-- Page 702 -->

group. The importance of their contributions is reinforced at every turn and so the scholarly side of students is drawn out, even for the students who are at first hesitant to speak. The environment, the culture, changes them.

But notice in particular how, after the initial *Turn and Talk*, one student, Adriel, is called on to share his response. It's a *Cold Call*, by the way. Adriel hadn't raised his hand. But voice equity is important. In a good classroom, everyone's voice matters and BreOnna expresses that with her *Cold Call*. Is Adriel nervous? Perhaps. But in addition to BreOnna's sincere interest and gracious smile, his classmates track him to show his ideas matter to them. This draws him out. They snap occasionally as he speaks to encourage and appreciate his thinking. In the glow of their respect, he speaks earnestly and with depth. He would not do that if their eye contact and body language did not encourage him to; if they slouched and looked away out the window. No one would. Left on his own, he might have sat silently but here he is drawn out into the sunlight of his peers. Changing the social cues he sees changes his behavior. He is discovering that his ideas are worthy of appreciation from his peers. A classroom with strong *Habits of Attention* I noted earlier, is like a bright mirror. It reflects its students' talents, but it is changing them at the same time.

Adriel's relationship with BreOnna certainly influences his work in school, but not as much as the interactions with his peers do. Thus BreOnna has sought to shape and guide them so they are as beneficial as possible.

Notice also that BreOnna calls next on Renee. She's got plenty to say as well and we can see that she knows the culture of the classroom will embrace her cerebral reflections. But notice also how she builds off of Adriel. This happens in part because of the classroom's habits but

---

<!-- Page 703 -->

it's important to recognize that *Habits of Discussion* rely on *Habits of Attention*. She is attentive and focused during both the *Turn and Talk*—when she tracked and nodded and encouraged and so locked into her conversations—and while Adriel was speaking. Her answer reflects strong attention habits.

Finally, check out Denarius Frazier's tenth-grade math classroom at Uncommon Collegiate High School in Brooklyn (*Denarius Frazier: Solutions*). Using *Habits of Attention* with high schoolers might seem daunting but the results are surprisingly similar. As you watch, I hope you note the high “ratio” in the classroom—it's the students who do the work. They actively engage in tasks both challenging and worthy. The level of the discussion is high. You might also note the open-mindedness of Vanessa, who begins to defend her answer, recognizes her mistake, and changes her thinking without defensiveness. Look at the still image of the moment when this happens. The eye contact—tracking—is important and so are the facial expressions. The moment happens because she is receiving strong signals of psychological safety and belonging throughout: her classmates' eyes and faces and body language say *We are with you*.

---

<!-- Page 704 -->

So I want to change my answer.

What we're seeing is in part unnatural. At least it starts that way. At first, no group of people will of their own accord behave in a manner educationally optimal for the group as a whole. So it may be true that students begin tracking mostly because a teacher has asked them to. They are nudged, to use Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein's term for an environment that encourages optimal decision making from participants, but once the nudge has happened, the action often becomes their own, a vehicle by which they express a culture of belonging and supporting one another of their own volition. They feel the difference and having felt it, embrace it. The classroom is more humanized than “dehumanized” by the tracking.

**TECHNIQUE 49: ENGINEER EFFICIENCY**

---

<!-- Page 705 -->

Whether they use the term or not, nearly all educators develop procedures—set ways to complete recurring tasks—and teach them to students. One reason why procedures are so ubiquitous in classrooms is that, when designed well, they help teachers conserve time for learning. A second reason is that procedures “hack attention”; they save working memory for more important things. A third slightly more hidden benefit is that when students know what to do without being told, teachers have to make fewer corrections and can talk to them about more important or more positive things. Still, as every teacher knows, not all procedures are created equal. Sometimes, a procedure that’s poorly designed can make doing a task more difficult. To avoid this pitfall, I recommend designing procedures that satisfy five criteria: Simplicity, Plan the Words, Quick Is King, Little Narration Required, and Double Planned.

**Simplicity.** Plan the simplest way to complete each key task correctly. Although this point might seem obvious, teachers are sometimes tempted to design elaborate procedures because executing them can be fun. Adding that extra sequence of *Call and Response* or holding students in a crisp line for an additional fifteen seconds can also make things feel orderly. But in the end, these are perverse incentives. You want procedures so that you can get to learning. Period. The simplest version is the best.

If you’re not sure whether or not you should add something to your procedure, ask yourself: Does it help my students accomplish the task? Will I want to require them to do this step every time they do this task for the rest of the year? Will the productivity I gain be greater than the cost in time? The answer will often be yes, but strive to make certain of that for each step, and trim the procedure down to a handful of actions.

---

<!-- Page 706 -->

**Plan the Words.** “First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain … which habit to use,” writes Charles Duhigg in *The Power of Habit*, “Then there is the routine.” The words that cue a procedure to begin and the ones that guide its steps *are part of the routine*. They should be planned as carefully and used as consistently as any other part. Notice how carefully Nikki Bowen says the word “transition” to her first graders in the video *Nikki Bowen: Stand Up* and how “shoulder partners” or “table partners” is the cue for different version of *Turn and Talk* in the video *BreOnna Tindall: Keystone*.

**Quick Is King.** Make the most of class time by showing students the fastest right way to do something. Even tightening your procedures by mere seconds can lead to big savings over the course of a school year. To get a sense of just how much time is at stake, let’s say that your students completed ten transitions per day. Next, imagine that you pruned these transitions down by a minute apiece and sustained that pace for two hundred school days. Practically speaking, this would enable you to add back an entire week’s worth of instructional time. That’s one more week you could spend analyzing the themes in *Animal Farm*, teaching students how to dissect a frog, or helping students master the skill of adding fractions with unlike denominators. Looking at it the opposite way can give you a sense of just how much time inefficient procedures can steal from you and your students.

To challenge your students to get it right as quickly as possible and to discipline yourself to focus on speed, practice procedures against the clock. Use a stopwatch to measure and celebrate progress while continuously challenging kids to execute the procedures a little faster. “We did this in sixteen seconds yesterday; let’s shoot for twelve today!”

---

<!-- Page 707 -->

That said, keep in mind that you are shooting for the fastest possible “right version”; if your students go so fast that they get it wrong, it’s better to have them go back, do it slower but just right, and then keep practicing. Once it’s done correctly you can speed it up.

**Little Narration Required.** When it comes to establishing a procedure, using fewer words to manage the execution is preferable. The goal is autonomy, and too many directions from the teacher keeps students from internalizing how to do it on their own. Autonomy is also lost if students need you there to explain each detail.

Further, providing too much verbal support (in the form of hints or reminders) cheapens the sense of satisfaction students get from successfully completing a procedure without your help. Saying less helps them feel more independent and take more ownership of it.

Plan the phrases you want to use at each step to ensure their clarity and efficiency. Use them consistently and with as little other verbiage as possible. Over time, remove verbal reminders and use only nonverbals, which students can refer to only if they need them. In time, remove those reminders as well; only step in to reinforce the procedure if students show you they need it.

**Double Planned.** Plan for what both you *and* your students will do at every step in a procedure. Then walk through the procedure yourself or with peers to make sure it works and there are no unexpected blind spots.

**TECHNIQUE 50: ROUTINE BUILDING**

A beautifully designed procedure is not yet a tool for success in your classroom until it has become habit, and there are six keys to “installing” a routine. *Routine Building* lays the groundwork for success, paving the way via clear

---

<!-- Page 708 -->

explanation and consistent reinforcement that disappears as excellence becomes habitual—but never goes away entirely.

The process of installation starts with a “rollout,” a short speech in which you explain not only the *what* but the *why*. Students will be more invested if they understand your purpose and the value they put on such an understanding increases with every grade level. A rollout doesn't have to be a long description; you'll want to install a lot of routines so, for many, a sentence or a phrase will do. “We want to make sure to spend our time on more important things so we want to do it quickly.” Other, more significant routines might warrant a bit more explanation—a rollout speech of a few sentences. See, for example, soccer coach James Beeston explaining his means of participation to his athletes in practice. He'll *Cold Call*, he tells them, because the game will demand a lot from them so training should, too. It wouldn't be hard to make a classroom version of that. Just be careful to not overdo it. Don't apologize for wanting what's best for students, just help them understand why it's best. Be crisp and clear and honest. And smile, as Jo Facer says in *Simplicity Rules*. You're helping students do things that will cause them to thrive and be successful. That's a good thing.

1. Next you'll want to outline the procedure, probably walk students through it if it's complex—pack up your things, stand up, push in your chair, and get ready to line up at the door—and if students are younger, maybe even number the steps at first so you can practice more intentionally, saying “Let's make sure we've got step number 2 down” or using nonverbal cues, as Lauren Moyle does in the video *Lauren Moyle: This Is Your Challenge*. Numbering has the effect of chunking the procedure into discrete steps that students can master

---

<!-- Page 709 -->

and commit more easily to long-term memory. If you're teaching students how to transition from one location to another, it can also help to use a method called *point-to-point movement*. The idea is to identify a location or an action and then prompt students to move to that point and stop (for example, “Please stop at the corner of the hallway”). Parsing the transition into steps provides you with clear starting and stopping points, allowing you to control the pace with more precision. If you don't establish clear end points, releasing students to practice a new transition can lead to a mass of confusion, shoving, and squabbling that's difficult to stop, let alone manage.

2. Then model and describe. That is, explain and show students how to do the procedure. Doing both gives students a visual road map that they can follow and establishes a common language around the procedure. This is especially useful for “pain points,” parts of the procedure that often prove tricky for students and that you therefore want to see and understand especially well in advance, or common mistakes that students will make when raising their hands (“I'm not waving it in the air. I'm not holding it over my head”). This makes the difference between correct and incorrect more visible to students. And a demonstration contains more detail than you can ever get in words, and research suggests that working memory for auditory and visual information may be additive. That is, students can absorb twice as much before working memory becomes overloaded.

3. After you've modeled and described, you'll want to let students practice. Lots. To truly master procedures, students need repeated practice with timely feedback on their execution. Far too often, teachers don't ask students to practice enough before releasing them to

---

<!-- Page 710 -->

execute procedures on their own. This sets up students for failure. With younger students you may wish to practice in isolation—that is, to separate the practice from the context in which it will be executed and be very deliberate: “Let's practice pushing in our chairs and getting ready to line up now.” We often see teachers with the most effective procedures using Pretend Practice—that is, distorting practice deliberately in ways that make it less realistic but more focused and effective at building skills. For a transition in an art room where there are lots of materials, you might start by having students practice without materials first to get the routine down and then add back in the crayons and the glue and the paint to make sure they can do it at full complexity—and full potential for spillage—when they already know their way through it.

## Here are some ways you might see Pretend Practice:

1. *Isolated step*. Sometimes teachers will choose just one small aspect of a procedure and practice it over and over or at half speed to make sure their students get it. Only then will they speed it up to real time or link it to the steps before and after it.

2. *Strategically simplified*. Sometimes a teacher will remove a distraction to make practice more effective—for example, by practicing a transition without books the first few times (“Imagine you're carrying your books”) or by practicing the process for putting materials away in art class without the actual supplies the first few times. That way students can lock in on the steps with simplicity and without pencils and crayons rolling around on the floor.

---

<!-- Page 711 -->

3. *Faux errors.* Other times, a teacher will ask students to deliberately make a common error to role-play how to respond. “What do you do if you go to the left if everyone is going to the right? Let's try it and work it out.”

    With older students, the practice is much more compelling if it's embedded in real content, even relatively simple orientation content. The video *Mallory Grossman: Quick Poll* is a great example. Mallory contrives a way for students to practice their new routines three times over the course of the first lesson. My colleagues on the *TLAC* team and I have also come to believe in something else Mallory is doing here—embedding practice of procedures in content for students above the primary level. This allows the students to feel the benefits of the routines and makes practice more natural.

    A common mistake is to stop practicing once a routine appears stable. Routines require periodic maintenance to make sure they stay in ideal running order. Occasional feedback or a *Do It Again*—“Whoops, we were a little slow getting started with our *Stop and Jot* or our *Turn and Talk* there. Let's practice that again”—is important. And remember the *Forgetting Curve*: to learn something students have to begin to forget and then come back to something—usually multiple times. And a strong routine in October does not guarantee a strong routine in December. A little refresher, even before it is becomes necessary, is always smart, doubly so because you can practice without implying anything is wrong: “Let's be super attentive to our *Habits of Discussion* or *Habits of Attention* today.”

    Once students are able to complete a procedure in the right way, strive to transfer ownership, passing some of the

---

<!-- Page 712 -->

responsibility to students. Doing so gives students a greater sense of accomplishment, independence, and ownership over classroom structures.

Recently, we taped a lesson to watch Maggie Johnson's eighth-grade English class at Troy Preparatory Middle School and uncovered a hidden gem in the first few seconds of the video.

“Pencils down when you hear the beep,” she said, referring to the timer that's about to go off and signifies the end of independent work. “No countdown today.” In fact, there would be no countdown as part of Maggie's routine for the rest of the year, she later told them. Maggie was transitioning her kids from one highly effective system to another—replacing a teacher-narrated countdown with a simpler, faster, and more mature system wherein her students come to attention on their own at the beep. Maggie's countdown system was very effective, and sometimes it's the things that go well in our classes that we hold on to hardest—sometimes for a fraction too long, or that's the risk at least. In Maggie's case, despite the effective system already in place, she realized either that as eighth graders, her students were ready for a bit more autonomy and self-management, or that eliminating the countdown would be faster and less disruptive to the work they were doing, or both.

In short, what we were observing in Maggie's class was a transfer of ownership. In effect, Maggie was saying, “You've proven you can master this part of being scholars on your own, so now I give you more autonomy. You ‘own’ the rate at which you earn more freedom to self-manage.” This can be a powerful trade, especially when students understand that the autonomy is earned via mastery and follow-though.

## Other Notes on Transferring Ownership

---

<!-- Page 713 -->

- **Say "You're Ready"**: Remind students that you are giving them more autonomy in appreciation of their maturity and responsibility ... that they've earned it. It's often great to make this a gradual process since it's better to give than to take away.

- **"You Know"**: As you remove scaffolding, add language to make your actions transparent. Remind students that (1) they know what to do, and (2) you are aware of and appreciate this. “You don't need reminders from me anymore... .”

- **A Little Less in Sync**: You can transfer responsibility to students by simplifying a routine or eliminating steps, or by simply allowing them to complete the procedure without requiring that it be done in exact coordination with classmates.

- **Shared Leadership**: Let students assume leadership roles—cuing their classmates to begin stages of a routine, monitoring or evaluating its success, modeling for others, having specific jobs or responsibilities.

A caveat is important here: some teachers assume that because earned autonomy is an effective form of transferred ownership, they would do well to transfer ownership at the outset with a tacit bargain: “I'm going to give you a lot of autonomy, but I want you to show me that you understand how to use it, or I'll take it away.” This is usually less effective. Unless you've started with discipline—teaching and establishing what routines should look like—students won't know what you mean by “how to use it” and will likely struggle. Your choice will then be to remove the autonomy you initially offered—potentially messaging that the systems you now establish are a punishment rather than “how we do things,” and undertaking a more difficult installation (taking away freedom is harder than giving it)—

or to fail to rein in the freedoms when students struggle, which means poor systems and routines for the year. Earning autonomy will help students value and understand it.

# Better Late Than Never: Tips for Rebooting Procedures and Routines

Procedures are best installed and routinized at the beginning of the year, but there are always times when a new procedure or system (that is, a set of related procedures) needs to be installed midyear. Culture has begun to slip, or morale to wane. You realize several months into the year that there's something you wish you'd routinized from the outset. Perhaps you've even arrived new, midyear, and in the wake of a teacher without systems and have been asked to rebuild the culture. A classroom “reset,” which often involves rolling out brand-new systems and reintroducing or modifying old ones, can be a necessity. Before you reset, consider these tips to ensure that it goes as smoothly as possible:

- **Set a goal:** Connect the reboot to an inspiring, headline-grabbing goal or important date—right now or in the future (for example, “We only have 60 days left until we take our comprehensive exams. We need to be ready so we're going to sharpen up the little things”).
- **Reboot after a break.** Take advantage of these periods away from class; they provide you with a natural excuse to reintroduce old procedures or to make a clean break from the past. (“We're just back from the long weekend and it's a good time to get all our procedures sharpened up so we're really focused and engaged for our next novel.”)

---

<!-- Page 715 -->

- **Be transparent.** Briefly explain *why* you're rebooting. If you don't, you risk confusing students and losing their buy-in. “Sometimes when we do things over and over, we get a little sloppy with our execution. It's normal for everyone, but it's causing us to lose important learning time that you need to get ready for college. We're going to think back to when I taught you X at the beginning of the year—we'll review what we need to do and practice doing it not just well, but perfectly.”

- **Coordinating with your team.** Coordinating your reboot with other teachers at your grade level, in your hall or across the school, provides more consistent reinforcement for students and thus easier and quicker change.

- **Follow up with precise praise.** Acknowledge progress, and praise students who exceed your expectations. If students pick up the procedures with less practice than they did at the beginning of the year, recognize their growth. This shows students that your reset isn't a punishment or indictment, but rather an expression of your belief in their ability to meet your high expectations.

# Props

Props are a form of public praise for students who demonstrate excellence or exemplify virtues. If you can consistently enable classmates to deliver resounding praise to one another in two seconds flat, you can build a culture that valorizes achievement and effort without sacrificing order or time on task. As students come to relish the culture of Props, you might even teach them a wide variety of them (see the end of the chapter for a list of suggestions) and let a student nominate Props for a classmate who did a great job.

The key is to invest the time at the outset to teach students to give Props the right way: crisply, quickly, and enthusiastically, just as you would with any routine. Ensuring that you teach your students to deliver Props that meet the following criteria will go a long way to ensuring your success:

- **Quick.** You should be able to cue a Prop in one second. Similarly, the Prop itself should be fast because you don't have time to waste and because there's nothing less energizing than an exhortation that starts strong but peters out. If it's not sharp, reinforce with *Do It Again* (*technique 51*, later in this chapter) and make sure to get it right.

- **Visceral.** Props are often powerful when they rely on movement and sound, especially percussive sound. Props that don't use much in the way of words are less likely to get tiresome; their half-life is longer because there's no phrase to wear out. A quick “Oh, yeah,” is fine, but something like “On the way to college!” is likely to get old (and show its age) quickly. Furthermore, there's something fun

---

<!-- Page 717 -->

and muscular about the thunder of group percussion.

- **Universal.** When you give Props, everybody joins in. It's up to you to set and enforce this expectation.
- **Enthusiastic.** The tone is energetic and lively. It should be a break—brief and fun—from hard work. Resist the temptation to make it too grown-up; it doesn't have to narrate values and express a mission-aligned personal credo. If it's a little bit of silly, it will reinforce moments when students have already demonstrated those things. Props are the exclamation point, not the sentence.
- **Evolving.** Let your students suggest and develop ideas for Props. They will constantly renew the systems with fresh and funky ideas and will participate more vigorously because they have helped invent them. And if students are forever thinking of new ones, Props will never get tired, boring, or obligatory.

# TECHNIQUE 51: DO IT AGAIN

Routines give students a clear model of how to execute common tasks successfully and clear working memory for higher-order tasks. If the transition is quick and automatic, students' minds can be free to roam or to reflect on content, like yours on your drive to work, perhaps. The more familiar the routine, the more it benefits your classroom and your students, in other words. What that implies is lots of practice. Practice with feedback and correction is the only way to build a habit. That's where *Do It Again* comes in. It is a very simple idea: when we are learning something and need to refine the routine or when

---

<!-- Page 718 -->

we have not done something as well as we might, the most productive response is simply to do it over, a little better, a little sharper. This response—“That wasn't quite right; let's try it again,” or “That was good, but let's try it again and see if we can be great”—is far superior to the alternatives: either ignoring the issue and letting quality of follow-through degrade, or chastening students for poor execution, or loading up their working memory with feedback they don't really get to use. By having students strive to do it over and better, you leverage the power of repetition and practice to painlessly build strong culture and self-discipline.

*Do It Again*, in other words, is the perfect tool to help maintain proficiency at something your students know how to do. It can as easily be applied to math procedures—“Try that again and make sure your decimals are lined up”—and classroom habits—“Just a minute, guys. Carlton, please start your answer over again and we'll all make sure we're giving you strong eye contact while you're speaking.”

In a range of situations it's effective because:

- *It shortens the feedback loop.* Behavioral science has shown that the shorter the time lag between an action and a response, the more effective the response will be in changing the behavior. Let's say you have a clear expectation for entering the classroom, and a group of students comes in from recess in a disorderly way. Having the group stay in for recess three hours later is less likely to change their behavior than is a lesser response that occurs right away. If the reaction comes immediately after, while the original action is fresh in the students' minds, the two will be more clearly associated in their memory. In the three-hours-later scenario, they will be more likely to think, “She kept me in for recess.” In the moment, they are more likely

---

<!-- Page 719 -->

to recall and reflect on how they entered the classroom. *Doing It Again* shortens the feedback loop in comparison to almost any other consequence.

- *It sets a standard of excellence, not just minimal follow-through.* *Do It Again* is appropriate not just for times when students do something poorly; it's ideal for times when students do something “just fine” when the goal is excellence. Saying, “That was good, but I want great” or “In this class, we're going to strive to do everything world class; let's see if we can use a bit more expression when we read” enables a teacher to set a standard of excellence, where good can always be better and better can always shoot for best. This can drive your classroom culture by replacing acceptable with excellent, first in the small things and then in all things.

- *It promotes group culture and accountability.* Although individuals can easily be asked to *Do It Again*, the technique is especially effective as a response to group endeavors. If three or four students don't bother to engage in the *Turn and Talk* the best solution may be to pause the whole class and say, “Just a second. A couple of us might have been distracted at the beginning of that *Turn and Talk*. It's important that we all engage the question and our partner. I'll cue you again and I look forward to seeing your best conversational skills. Go!” As an aside, there are times when it feels wrong to hold groups too accountable for individuals who try to co-opt their purposes. Suffice it to say that because you can leverage group accountability does not mean you should in every situation.

- *It ends with success.* The last thing you remember of an event often shapes your perception of it more broadly. *Do It Again* ends a situation where a process was done

---

<!-- Page 720 -->

with insufficient quality with success. The last thing students do in a sequence is to do an activity the right way. This helps engrain the perception and memory of what right looks like. It also helps build muscle memory. Students build the habit of doing it right, over and over. In fact one of the most interesting times to *Do It Again* is to encode success. As in: “That was perfect. Do it again just like that so you remember just what it feels like.” The “it” could be a math problem or playing a perfect eighth note. In fact, watch the video *John Burmeister: Trill*. In it, John, who is one of my favorite music teachers, is teaching cello to an individual student. Notice how many times she plays a trill in the course of learning it—eleven times, actually. Sometimes because it's not quite there; sometimes to add a layer of detail; sometimes to encode success—three more just like that.

- *It is reusable.* As John's cello video shows, *Do It Again* can be reused frequently so you always have a way to respond that's productive. You don't need to keep inventing new responses. You can be positive in administering the third iteration: “I still think we can do this even better. Let's give it one more shot!” Add a stopwatch to some routines, and the challenge of *Do It Again* (and do it better) only becomes more powerful.

However, it's important to execute the technique well. *Do It Again* should be positive whenever possible, with a keen focus on getting better and, in a great classroom, informed by a constant narrative of “good, better, best.” That is, “just doing it” gets replaced by doing it well. In fact, one colleague suggested that a better name for this technique is *Do It Better*, as better captures the idea that doing things over again to be as good as you can be is what school is

---

<!-- Page 721 -->

about. The goal is not merely compliance but excellence, even in the little things.

*Do It Again* can be an effective tool for managing affect. Sometimes people's attitudes change from the outside in. Asking a low-energy class to repeat something with enthusiasm (especially, and critically, while modeling those attributes yourself) can start to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. *Do It Again* is a great opportunity to challenge students positively to show you their best. Saying, “Oooh, let's line up again and prove why we're the best reading group in the school” is often better than saying, “Class, that was very sloppy. We're going to do it again until we get it exactly right,” even if the purpose in both cases is to *Do It Again* until you get it exactly right. You can see Kirby Jarrell do a lovely job of that in *Kirby Jarrell: Go Brown*. The class is timing themselves at how long it takes to get materials from the previous class put away and to have their novels out and ready. Michaela is running the clock and she reports that it took 48 seconds, an excellent time, so Kirby playfully decides to celebrate by having her kids say, “48 seconds? Go Brown!” [They're nicknamed after the university]. Students do it and the energy is a bit mixed. With a warm smile and a bit of bravery—everyone wants to cut bait when an idea appears not to work—Kirby playfully asks students to do it again with more enthusiasm. And they do it! And the energy level rises in the class and students appear energized a bit. It's a tiny throwaway moment but imagine—maybe Kirby keeps the chant for next class, maybe she doesn't—but imagine the message if she'd just let the mediocre follow-through remain the end point. The message might have been *Oh, that was awkward. If Ms. Jarrell asks you to do something silly just wait it out and we'll give up on it.* Here it ends pleasant and off-handed but at no loss to her enthusiastic and playful classroom culture.

---

Lastly, teachers sometimes think they need to wait until an entire routine or activity is done before asking the class to try it again. In fact, you should have students go back and try it again as soon as you know that the level of execution will not meet the standard you set for it. Don't wait for the routine to end. Again, this will better connect the stimulus to the response. Let's say students are lining up for lunch, and the drill is to stand up quietly, push in their chairs, turn to face the door, and then follow the table leader to the door. If students forget to push in their chairs, have them sit back down and try it again right then. This saves time and reinforces instant accountability.

# Putting It All Together

In the video *Montage: Do It Again*, you can see a few intriguing video examples of *Do It Again* in the classroom. You'll have to watch carefully because they come and go fast, which is part of the point. The less fuss, less disruption, and less censuring of students, the better. Simple and clear, nonjudgmental, and even positive when possible. You can see that in Erica Lim's class. She's starting for the day and wants to make sure to set expectations for follow-through on the greeting. It's not a big thing, yet you don't have to do it if you don't want to make follow-through questionable on all tasks. So she offers a simple and quick and emotionally constant reminder of what she knows her high schoolers know how to do. Denarius Frazier, too, is emotionally constant. If we're going to try to use tools that build positive culture and show appreciation for success, they'll be positive only if they are universal. When the response is spotty, Denarius asks quickly for a redo—the quicker the better—and is almost deadpan, showing a hint of a surprise. Much better, he says, when students follow through. He's reinforced this routine and the norm of follow-through on all such routines.

---

<!-- Page 723 -->

It's a tiny but important movement and it's the simplicity of the responses and Denarius's lack of fuss that makes it successful. Sarah Ott's approach is similar and different. When students are slow in wrapping up and responding to her, she's playful and upbeat and energetic rather than steady, but she still gets her *Do It Again* done fast. It's a technique that usually gets more out of less.

7. It's not a coincidence that tech engineers use the phrase “eyeballs” to describe the level of attention commanded by their software. Eyeballs are the currency of the gig economy, though of course the purpose of software is the opposite of a teacher's—it seeks to win attention through distraction. Teachers seek to build the ability to sustain and focus concentration. Is it necessary to point out that the winner of this battle—whether young people flick reactively from one push notification to the next or can sustain focus on what's most important

9. You can see the story of one such example in Ron Suskind's outstanding book *A Hope in the Unseen* about Cedric Jennings, who manages to get from his high school in Anacostia to Brown University. The price of his success is massive. Everywhere he goes he is an outsider and more— a constant target of mockery. Humans are deeply social and precious few people will embark on a journey that will result in their being made a pariah.

10. Why do people traffic in this distortion? Perhaps some genuinely believe it because they have not seen classrooms like Christine's. Some perhaps mistake the benign and beneficial authority of a teacher with authoritarianism—the abuse of authority. But for others it is a selfish act. They use words like “carceral” to describe it, to exonerate themselves from responsibility. No one doubts that ours is an education system that systematically constrains the opportunities of poor and minority children. For some, making their own protest is the priority; their goal is to make it clear that they are not responsible. Unfortunately, shouting slogans doesn't solve problems. I prefer to solve the problem and make classrooms better even if it opens me up to simplistic and self-serving calumny.
