goal is to use questioning in a lesson, it's necessary to take the next step: use it for what?

If the end purpose is to use thinking to elicit different types of thinking, it's worth noting that we often fall into unconscious habits—consistently asking the same types of questions—and thus elicit the same types of thinking, perhaps overlooking opportunities for different types of questions that elicit different types of thinking. Categorizing questions by the type of thinking they seek to foster is an imperfect endeavor at best, but it can help to push us outside our familiar habits and ways. With that in mind, here are five purposes for questions:

1. Discovery: Some questions are intended to cause students to *discover* or derive a new idea. I could ask you questions designed to make you realize that an author is talking about something that the *reader* knows but the *main character* doesn't. When you explain that this is happening, I tell you it's called “dramatic irony.”

2. Application: Just as rigorous—sometimes more so—is to start with the idea and ask students to apply or explain its *application*. I tell you that “dramatic irony” is when the reader knows something the main character doesn't and then ask, “Why is the author using dramatic irony here?” or “How is it different from the last time she used it?”

3. Check for understanding: There are also *check for understanding* questions, which are retrospective: “Why did we say the author was using dramatic irony? Where was the dramatic irony in yesterday's reading?”

4. Retrieval practice: We use *Retrieval Practice* questions to encode ideas in students' long-term memory. such as “Please define dramatic irony for me, Charles.”
