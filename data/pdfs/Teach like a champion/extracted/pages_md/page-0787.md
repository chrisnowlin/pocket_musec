This is what I call a **register shift** and to understand it further it will be helpful to first define the term *register*, which I use to refer to the overall tone communicated by a teacher's affect—her voice, her body language, her facial expressions, and so on. In our study of classrooms, we typically observe teachers shifting between three registers: casual, formal, and urgent.

The table titled “Three Registers” further differentiates typical features.

### Three Registers

| Register | Voice/Words | Body Language |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Casual** | • Words may run together (e.g. with a pitter-patter rhythm)<br>• Frequent vocal inflections and a wide range of pitch<br>• Use of colloquial language | • Asymmetrical distribution of weight on each foot (e.g. leaning more on one foot)<br>• Relaxed posture<br>• Inconsistent eye contact |
