# Required Reading: *The Writing Revolution*

No book is better at helping educators think about expanding students' ability to craft sentences and expand their syntactic control than Judith Hochman's *The Writing Revolution*.10 Among the highlights are the developmental writing activities she suggests. These are similar to and work in synergy with *Art of the Sentence* work. We use them regularly in our Reading Reconsidered Curriculum. Some of the best extracts:

*Because. But. So.* Take a “kernel sentence” (a short simple sentence) and expand it three times, once each time using each of the three conjunctions, *because*, *but*, and *so*. Not only does it teach a core piece of syntactic control but it causes students to think about an idea in three different ways.

*Appositives.* Expand a kernel sentence with an appositive phrase. This teaches their use, the ability to insert ideas midsentence, and causes students to expand and apply more background knowledge.

*Sentence expansion.* Take a kernel sentence and expand it with some number of *who*, *when*, *what*, *where*, and *why*.

For examples of these and other Hochman gems, please see technique 42, *Regular Revision*.

One of the benefits of developmental writing is that it teaches grammar functionally, in the service of idea creation. To that end, schools might think about a scope and sequence of developmental writing activities to teach key elements of grammar in a systematic way. Here's a
