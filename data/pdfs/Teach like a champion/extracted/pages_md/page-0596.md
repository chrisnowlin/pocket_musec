least as important as writing an initial idea—but also causes students to engage in the discussion with a more flexible mindset: What can I learn here, and how will I apply it to my idea? This mindset is not just theoretical—someone tells me I ought to be doing that. In practice, as a student, I am prompted, ideally over and over again, to do it with the result being that I become very good at coming up with an initial opinion, writing it down to formulate it into words, engaging in an exchange with peers in which I harvest ideas that I can weave into my own thinking, and then revising my initial opinion in writing—locking down the changes in my thinking in specific, visible words and syntax. If students could do that every day, I suspect the difference for their learning, and also for a populace prone to righteous and reflexive confidence that their opinion is assuredly the only right one, would be significant.
