Here are some additional tips for maintaining your *Emotional Constancy*:

**Criticize behaviors rather than people.** "That behavior is inconsiderate" is a statement about a temporary situation. It's also a statement that, with a bit of tweaking, would allow you to show that you don't think that it's typical of a given student: "It's unlike you to behave this way. Please fix it immediately." This is better than making a permanent statement about a student: "You are inconsiderate." If your goal is trust, it can be a long way back from too many statements of that kind.

**Avoid globalizing.** Saying "You always" do X or asking "Why are you always doing" Y makes the conversation about events that are no longer within a student's control—and that he or she may not even remember. This makes the issue seem bigger and less focused on a specific action, and can make your correction feel like a "gotcha."

**Take your relationship out of it.** Telling a student you feel disappointed or betrayed by his or her actions, or personalizing your response—for example, "I thought I could trust you"—makes the interaction about you rather than about a student learning productive and socially responsible behavior. Framing things impersonally diffuses emotion and keeps your role in the conversation to that of coach and mediator, helping the student to learn those behaviors that will benefit her most in the long run.
