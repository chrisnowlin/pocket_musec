**Student:** He didn't give much thought into what he did to the baby and he acted fine with it.

## Ask for Another Way to Answer

Often there are multiple ways to answer a question. When students solve it one way, it's a great opportunity to make sure they can use all available methods. Arielle Hoo is essentially using this approach in her math class when she asks students to “solve algebraically” what they have understood from looking at a graph of the system of equations, and you can tell from Jaheem’s and other students' responses that they almost expect, having initially solved graphically, to be asked to solve via another method as a follow-up.

Alternatively, imagine a teacher is reviewing a short, written paragraph by a student about a scene in *A Raisin in the Sun* as she circulates around the classroom. The student has written:
