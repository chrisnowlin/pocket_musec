reminder because she is reinforcing the point nonverbally. Then she drops her voice and begins her next sentence, “We're gonna go ahead and track Adriel ...”

Her register shifts in the middle of the sentence, I'd argue. In the first half (above picture) it is formal—I need you with me; class is starting—but in the second half of her sentence—as she Cold Calls Adriel—you probably notice a distinct shift to the casual. This is because—as I interpret it—her body language is now signaling information about the Cold Call rather than the preceding direction. She wants to make sure it feels inclusive and positive to Adriel. In his book *Culturally Responsive Teaching in the Classroom*, Adeyemi Stembridge reminds us that how students perceive our actions is as important as how we intend them, and as you can see in the picture below, BreOnna's bright smile and relaxed posture as she asks Adriel's classmates to “snap it up” for him ensures her actions will be received as they are intended. She wants to diffuse any tension and ensure that Adriel feels support and sunshine from his classmates.
