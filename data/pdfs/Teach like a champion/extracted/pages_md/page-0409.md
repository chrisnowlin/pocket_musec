off reading *Esperanza Rising*, close their books partway, and engage his eyes to show they are ready to discuss. After a brief discussion of why Esperanza and Miguel react differently to a train ride, he instructs, “Pick up reading, please, Melanie.” In less than two seconds, she and her classmates are back into the book at almost no transaction cost.

Similarly, Roberto de León might intone, “Finger in your book; close your book,” as he prepares his students to discuss *Phantom of the Opera*—and also prepares them to end that discussion and return to the book efficiently.

In the video *Jessica Bracey: Circle of Gold*, you can see Jessica, then at North Star Academy in Newark, New Jersey, executing a lesson with an effective segment of *FASE Reading* embedded in it.

You'll notice how engaged Jessica's students are as she keeps durations short and unpredictable, moving the reading around the room to involve lots of students. You'll also notice that even though she calls on a number of students to read, every single one picks up on cue—solid evidence that they're all reading along with her. But then again the best evidence of all comes after about a minute and a half. Jessica mixes in an opportunity for volunteers. “Please continue for me ...” she begins, and hands shoot into the air. Students love reading when it comes to life this way; their hands show how much they feel a sense of belonging. They want to be a part of the experience.
