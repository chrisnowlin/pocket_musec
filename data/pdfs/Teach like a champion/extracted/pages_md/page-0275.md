3. You might be wondering *How many times do I have to review a concept to get it into long-term memory?* There's no clear answer—a lot depends on who is learning what, when—but in his long-term study of student learning, *The Hidden Lives of Learners*, Graham Nuthall found that he and his colleagues could predict with 80-85 percent accuracy whether a student in a given class would learn something they did not previously know, based on whether they had encountered the full concept three different times during class. Given that students are sometimes not paying full attention or do not get the whole concept and that facility and speed of access continue to increase and improve one's ability to perceive and connect, there may be an argument for more than three repetitions for many concepts, even if Nuthall is correct.

4. Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel elaborate on elaboration in *Make It Stick*: “Elaboration is the process of giving new material meaning by expressing it in your own words and connecting it with what you already know. The more you can explain about the way your new learning relates to your prior knowledge, the stronger your grasp of the new learning will be and the more connections you create that will help you remember it later” (p. 5).

5. Factual knowledge enhances cognitive processes like problem solving and reasoning. The richer the knowledge base, the more smoothly and effectively these
