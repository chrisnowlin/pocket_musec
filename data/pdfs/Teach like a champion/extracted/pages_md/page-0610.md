## Because, But, So 2.0:

- More sophisticated versions (for example, *although*, *consequently*, *as a result of*)
- Esperanza opened her eyes although she did so only reluctantly.

## Develop with Prepositional Phrase:

- *Introductory:* “After a restless night's sleep, Esperanza opened her eyes ...”
- *Mid-sentence:* “Esperanza, in the middle of a bad dream, opened her eyes ...”

## Develop with Participial Phrase:

- *Introductory:* “Hoping it had all been a dream, Esperanza opened her eyes.”
- *Mid-sentence:* “Esperanza, dreaming of her father, opened her eyes.”
