you're afraid to just address Susan. In fact, Susan may think that as well. By directly reminding Susan what is expected—and why—you have helped her get ready to engage with the learning and maintained the norm of readiness that is shared by the class.

# Challenge!

Students love to be challenged, to prove they can do things, to compete, to win. So challenge them: exhort them to prove what they can do by building competition into the day. Students can be challenged as individuals or, usually better, as groups, and those groups can compete in various ways:

- Against other groups within the class (e.g. rows, tables)
- Against other groups outside the class (another homeroom)
- Against an impersonal foe (the clock; the test, to prove they're better than it is; their age—“That was acceptable work for seventh graders, but I want to see if we can kick it up to eighth-grade quality.”)
- Against an abstract standard (“I want to see whether you guys have what it takes!”)

Here are some examples to get you started. I'm sure you'll find it fun to think of more:

“You guys have been doing a great job this week. Let's see if you can take it up a notch.”

“I love the work I'm seeing. I wonder what happens when we add in another factor.”

“Let's see if we can write for ten minutes straight without stopping. Ready?!”
