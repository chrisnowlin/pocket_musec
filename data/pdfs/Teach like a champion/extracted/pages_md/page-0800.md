Many times when we give a direction, we communicate to listeners that the direction is an afterthought, because we appear to be doing something else while we give it. The message is *Something else is foremost in my mind relative to this direction*. If you are passing out papers while you direct students, you suggest that your directions aren’t that important. If you stop moving, you show that there is nothing more important than the direction you are giving. When you want directions to be followed, don’t engage in other tasks at the same time. It may even help to strike a formal pose.

You can see an example of this in the video of BreOnna Tindall. At about 3:25, BreOnna has wrapped up the discussion and is transitioning to the next task, introducing the passage the class will read during the day’s lesson.

“I’d like for us to be thinking about ‘blind justice,’” she says. But here she’s getting her materials ready and placing them on the projector. You’ll notice she starts to slow down her pace of diction, almost as if she’s stalling. She doesn’t want to engage the topic fully until she’s done with that task and can face students fully to show its importance.

Here’s what that moment looks like.
