# A Slightly More Detailed Model

- Perception is complex
- Knowledge
- Critical thinking analysis
- WM is very small
- LTM is essentially unlimited
- It’s best when it’s organized so ideas connect

In my version I've tried to make working memory very small to remind you that its capacity is limited. But long-term memory is large. The dotted line suggests that as far as cognitive scientists know, it is all but unlimited. Not only does having more knowledge in long-term memory not make it harder to add something new there, it may make it easier. The more you know, the more connections you can perceive to new knowledge; this makes it easier to remember more of that new knowledge and gives you more connections to help you recall it. An expression among cognitive scientists is “things that wire together fire together.” If we think about them at the same time, recalling them will also happen in concert and, in an ideal case, remembering something from long-term memory will enhance recall of related concepts and ideas. The antidote to the argument that memory is merely isolated facts is, in
