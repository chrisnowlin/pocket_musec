Focusing on limited and specific priority elements when you give feedback makes it easier to give immediate feedback to every student and, perhaps unexpectedly, this is often helpful in building relationships. The most important and genuine tool for relationship building is something you might call relational teaching—using the way you teach the content to build trust. Trust comes when your teaching demonstrates your skill as a teacher and your interest in and ability to help students learn. Giving effective and precise feedback communicates to each student:  

- Your success is important to me. I am aware of your progress in this endeavor.  
- I will help you succeed.  
- I believe you will succeed.  

That is more important in the long run to building trust with students than whether you chat with them in the hallways or ask them about what shows they like to watch. And it ensures that the relationships we build are about learning and the topics we study.
