# Online Lessons: *Means of Participation* Icons

The shift to remote teaching posed a unique set of challenges to teachers' working memory—challenges my team and I felt ourselves when we led trainings online. Like so many teachers, we often found ourselves using a presentation to structure our session. As we presented one slide we were often thinking of what the next slide covered, and trying to assess how our participants were responding to the session—reading their expressions, toggling over to the chat to field their questions or respond to their comments, prepping a breakout room. The new setting and the addition of technology resulted in working memory overload and it was shockingly easy to forget how we wanted participants to engage in the content of each slide. Even if we'd planned our *Means of Participation* we sometimes forgot to use what we'd planned at the right time and in the right way. Or we remembered but struggled to listen and respond as well as we could have. Our solution was to use icons to make our *Means of Participation* easy to remember so our working memory could be focused on participants.

We developed a set of icons that we placed at the bottom of our slides to remind us of the *Means of Participation* we'd planned:
