as if Tuesday's lesson never happened. Then, Rodrigo completed five complex area problems with ease; now you glance over his shoulder and see that he has gotten even simple problems wrong.

There is a silver lining, however, to this persistent challenge. The process of forgetting contains the seeds of its own solution. If you ask students to recall what they learned yesterday about the area of polygons or juxtaposition in *Romeo and Juliet* they will strain to remember but if successful, that struggle will more deeply encode the material in their long-term memories. They will remember a little more and forget a little less quickly.

*Retrieval Practice*, or the process of causing students to recall information they've learned after a strategic delay, is a practical solution to the problem of forgetting. If you graphed the process of retrieval practice it might look something like this, with each repetition along the top axis an iteration of retrieval practice and the percentages on the y-axis representing how much of a given body of content students remember.
