"I'm coming around to check that you've defined *fortuitous* in the margin and that your definition includes the word *lucky*."

You can see the benefit of this written record of learning in action in the video *Jon Bogard: Back to Your Notes*. After a robust conversation trying to determine the nature of a classmate's error, a student, India, has the chance, as Jon puts it, to “arbitrate.” To determine who is wrong and who is right, she refers back to her notes—with great glee, I might add—to prove that her conclusion is correct. (Don't miss the snaps of support from her classmates, which validate India's scholarly engagement and the high-five from the student in front of her after she drops her evidence on the class.) Here we see the long-term benefit of a clear *Own and Track* system. India is able to engage in this analysis independently because she has referred back to notes that she took the previous day. Then we see the system in action: Jon says to his students, “Fifteen seconds, back to your notes, update what you had before in light of what India just said.” He capitalizes on the moment of her insight by asking every student to record it, both increasing the chances that they will remember it and creating a record of it that they will be able to refer back to.
