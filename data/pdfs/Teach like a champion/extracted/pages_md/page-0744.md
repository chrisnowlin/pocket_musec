# Online Lessons: Remote *What to Do*

The importance of directions is critical—and critically overlooked—in most settings. Teaching remotely caused many of us to confront the challenges of clarity in this new setting. With glitchy Internet and an increased potential for distractions, with the difficulty of pairing nonverbal cues with directions and the fact that teachers’ directions suddenly were given in a tiny voice emanating from a window in the corner of a screen, it was many times easier for students to miss a direction online. And of course the safety net that has existed for students for time immemorial—if you don’t know what to do, look at what the people next to you are doing—also disappears when you are sitting alone at your kitchen table.

Under such conditions teachers learned a thing or two about giving directions.

One of our favorite videos was this one of Alonzo Hall’s “orientation screen” at the beginning of his lesson. His verbal directions are also given visually, with absolute clarity and absolute simplicity so they are much harder to miss or misunderstand. *Here’s what to do*, they say, with the most important parts highlighted in yellow.
