When they want to make a new point during a discussion, they raise their hand in the usual fashion. When they want to “add on,” develop, or respond to the previous point, they raise two fingers. This allows Maggie to shape the direction of the discussion even without participating in it. She can decide whether it's more valuable to stick with the present point or move on to a new one, and she can move in that direction merely by choosing whom she calls on to go next. In fact, keeping a discussion focused on a point of importance or value is one of the most important things for a teacher to attend to during discussion, a topic I will discuss in technique 46, *Disciplined Discussion*.

A last element of *Habits of Discussion* is the addition of teaching moves that cause students to build the habit—and ideally a mental model—of one speaker building off the previous. Follow-on questioning—an adaptation of the “follow-on” from the *Cold Call* (technique 34)—and follow-
