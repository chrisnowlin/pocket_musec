## Case Study 2

*Mr. Vaca:* What's the multiplicative inverse of negative three, Jason?  
*Jason:* Three.  
*Mr. Vaca:* But if I multiply negative three times three I get negative nine. Who can tell Jason what the multiplicative inverse of negative three is? Carlos?  
*Carlos:* The multiplicative inverse of negative three is negative one-third.  
*Mr. Vaca:* What is it, Jason?  
*Jason:* Negative one-third.  
*Mr. Vaca:* Good. Why, Jason?  
*Jason:* Because negative three times negative one-third equals one.  
*Mr. Vaca:* Good. So now tell me the multiplicative inverse of negative one-fifth.  
*Jason:* It's negative five.  
*Mr. Vaca:* And four?  
*Jason:* One-fourth.  
*Mr. Vaca:* (Smiling) Well, now you're just showing off.  

## TECHNIQUE 16: RIGHT IS RIGHT  

In almost every lesson, there comes a moment when a student's answer is similar to what you hoped you'd get (or, even better, to the exemplar you wrote when preparing your lesson), but something is still missing. The gist is there, or a kernel of the insight, but it's also not a response
