Often teachers make their observational focus transparent to students. “I'm coming around to look at your hypotheses,” they might say. At that time they'd try to give feedback only on that topic before adding additional rounds; for example, “This time I'm coming around to see whether you have described clear experimental and control groups.” This influences student actions even before they've given any feedback. Students see their teacher approaching and think about their hypothesis because they know she will be looking for it. Perhaps they focus on it more in the first place. Teachers influence students to focus on key tasks when they tell them that they are looking for them.

You can see evidence of these actions in Rafael Good's tracking sheet from his math class. He's worked the problem himself so he can use his own model to see gaps in student thinking more quickly, made notes on delivery moves (*Show Call* exemplary work!), and notes the time allocated for the work (“4 mins”) so he doesn't lose track. He's written out the initial phrase he wants to say when he sends students off to work (“Make sure to show multiplication steps”) and finally his Lap 1 focus (“L1”). He's written out the exact phrase he wants to use before he starts observing—“Checking for your multiplication steps to be written out.”
