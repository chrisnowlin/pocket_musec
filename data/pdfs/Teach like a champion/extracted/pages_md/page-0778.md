**Persistence and repetition.** When students *persistently* engage in off-task behavior that they know they shouldn't, this should push you more toward a consequence. This is especially true when students continue in spite of your correction(s). If, instead, the behavior appears to be a one time error caused by distraction or misunderstanding, then err on the side of correction.

**Degree of disruption.** If a student's behavior doesn't disrupt others' learning, then it's more likely that a correction is warranted. In contrast, if the student's behavior distracts or disrupts others, a consequence is more likely to be warranted. You have a responsibility to maintain the group environment.

**Motivation.** If a student is clearly testing your expectations, give a consequence. Tolerating willful defiance corrodes your authority in the eyes of the student as well as the rest of the class. Just be sure that's the case before you rush to judge.
