- **Be transparent.** Briefly explain *why* you're rebooting. If you don't, you risk confusing students and losing their buy-in. “Sometimes when we do things over and over, we get a little sloppy with our execution. It's normal for everyone, but it's causing us to lose important learning time that you need to get ready for college. We're going to think back to when I taught you X at the beginning of the year—we'll review what we need to do and practice doing it not just well, but perfectly.”

- **Coordinating with your team.** Coordinating your reboot with other teachers at your grade level, in your hall or across the school, provides more consistent reinforcement for students and thus easier and quicker change.

- **Follow up with precise praise.** Acknowledge progress, and praise students who exceed your expectations. If students pick up the procedures with less practice than they did at the beginning of the year, recognize their growth. This shows students that your reset isn't a punishment or indictment, but rather an expression of your belief in their ability to meet your high expectations.
