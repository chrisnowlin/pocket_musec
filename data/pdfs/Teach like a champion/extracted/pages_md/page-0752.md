Eyes up here, Please.

**Be Seen Looking** is the yin to **Radar**’s yang. One is seeing well, and the other is contriving ways to subtly remind students that you see them.

In *Marisa Ancona: Pens to Paper*, you can see Marisa doing this even before class has started. Notice how industriously her students get settled and ready for class. In large part this is because she puts such value on it. She is visibly watching, steadily and calmly with a bit of **Chin Up**, and making her way from one corner of the room to the other the whole time. What the teacher shows she values, students are more likely to value, and Marisa demonstrates how much she values student focus without saying a word.

Watching the various unspoken pantomimes teachers use to ensure that their students notice them looking, my colleagues on the TLAC team began to give humorous and lighthearted names for the most common among them.
