ensure that she understands what students are thinking, rather than to give them guidance. She's noting ideas rather than addressing misconceptions. When she writes on her clipboard, she's not tracking every student's accuracy, but rather taking notes on the trends she's seeing and highlighting students she might choose to call on later in discussion. In the subsequent discussion, you can see the results of BreOnna's ActiveObs. It's a great example of “hunting, not fishing.” BreOnna calls on Adriel, whose answer she knows is a good starting point, then Renee, who she knows has used the word “exonerates.”

“I try not to go for the kid who has the all-the-way right answer first,” BreOnna said. “I try to find people who have pieces of the right answer. As opposed to saying ‘build’ arbitrarily, I try to find people who have pieces of the right answer so they can really understand how a discussion works—what does it really mean to build?”

BreOnna's observation allows her to honor student voice but still curate the conversation for focus and quality, and, she noted, it allows her to ensure that students hear a high-quality response without having to provide it herself. “I don't always want to be the person stamping the right answer—that's boring! Also, that takes away the kids' belief that they know,” BreOnna said. “I try to find other kids in the classroom to unearth the key point.”
