Oh, check that remainder.

Uncommon Impact

Students are dividing polynomials and a student has struggled to find the remainder. But Denarius doesn't write “David: can't find remainder” or something like that. We know this because his notation is a tick mark, done in a fraction of a second, which thus allows him to keep circulating quickly with his working memory free. That might seem like a mundane observation but it tells us something profound: Denarius has made a list of likely errors and he's marking up this list each time he sees one. Not only can he now move quickly as he makes his rounds but as a trend in the data emerges he will see it in the data instantly. In fact in this clip Denarius recognizes that eight or nine students are struggling with the remainder and is able to target his reteach to exactly this issue—the one most relevant to the greatest number of students. He doesn't even need a step-back moment to analyze the data as we see Julia Addeo use; he simply glances at what is
