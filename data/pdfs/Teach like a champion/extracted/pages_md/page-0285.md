transparency in the process for students. Just make sure to remember to return to a student when you've said you will! Finally there's the *cue*. That's the idea that you can sometimes ask additional students you call on to provide key information that the initial student can use to answer after the return rather than the complete answer. This allows the initial student to do more of the work (and show that he or she can do more of the work). Note that, as I discuss below, a *cue* is different from a hint because the teacher guides the student to give especially useful information.
