You'll also notice a wide range of reading skills. There are outstanding readers who model expressive, engaged reading, and there are also some who struggle. Even so, those who struggle aren't afraid to read, even when it's tricky for them. There's a constantly supportive culture. And Jessica reacts to the stream of data that students reading aloud provide her to help them. She asks them to embed meaning into their expression or to reread words they didn't get the first time. Finally, you'll notice that the girl who reads first in the video also reads again later. Not only is it the ultimate in unpredictable reader selection—just because you've read once doesn't mean the game is over in Jessica's class—but this is a girl who's still developing her fluency skills. She gets double practice! And she's happy to read.
