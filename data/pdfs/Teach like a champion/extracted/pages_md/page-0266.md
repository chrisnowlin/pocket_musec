## Low-Tech *Show Call*

No document camera in your classroom? So be it. While you're in the process of petitioning district higher-ups to provide the single most useful and affordable piece of technology to enhance teaching available, here are four ways to do a low-tech *Show Call* in the meantime:

1. *Show Call* a piece of writing from yesterday's class or last night's homework by collecting it and making a transparency for use with the 1980s version of the document camera: the overhead projector. There's probably one sitting in a closet somewhere.
2. If there's no overhead projector, you can always simply copy the student work (last night's homework or yesterday's in-class writing) and ask students to edit at their desks.
3. Ask students to work on “slates”—mini whiteboards students can write on at their desks. Select one and show it to the class as your *Show Call*.
4. Transcribe a crucial sentence from one student's work on the board and “live edit” it with the class. My colleague Paul Bambrick-Santoyo recommends using flip chart paper for this purpose. Then the notes that capture the class's analysis can live on in your classroom as a permanent record of your collective thinking.
