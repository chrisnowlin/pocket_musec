Turns out giving effective directions is one of teaching’s core competencies and *What to Do* is the art of giving directions effectively. It is a case study in little things with big consequences.

The most basic version of poor directions occurs when teachers tell students what *not* to do. Let me offer a few examples:

> “Kevin, you shouldn't be looking out the window.”  
> “Cheryl, don't get distracted.”  
> “Class, don't hand me messy disorganized work.”

Now let me rewrite them to show how they might be different (acknowledging that a master teacher would probably make them far better):

> “Kevin, make sure you're getting everything on the board into your notes.”  
> “Cheryl, please turn to Carly and share your thoughts about the beginning of *Chapter Two*.”  
> “Class, make sure your decimals are lined up, you write neatly, and circle your final answer.”

In each of these cases, the revision is likely to help students be successful because it describes specific, concrete, and observable actions. When there are multiple steps, they are in a clear sequence.

I could have corrected “don't hand me messy or disorganized work” with “make sure your work is neat and organized,” for example. That might be fine. But it's a bit of an assumption that students know what it means to do neat and organized work. And even if they do, a reminder
