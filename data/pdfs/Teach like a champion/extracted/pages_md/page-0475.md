**Every Minute Matters ... Even in the Hallway**

One of the very first videos we shot in what became the *Teach Like a Champion* project, long before there was such a name, is a short video of History teacher Jamey Verilli managing his minutes one afternoon at North Star Academy.

> “Can you use it in a sentence, John?”  
> “Who would have been bound to the land in a Middle Ages town?”  
> “What are you bound to be doing right now?”

Class has not even started yet. Not in the classroom, not during class time, but Jamey recognized a learning opportunity. Meanwhile, his students are excited, smiling, happy to be engaged, and showing off their knowledge.
