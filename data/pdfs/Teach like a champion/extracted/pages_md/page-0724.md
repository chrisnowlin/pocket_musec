Humans are deeply social and precious few people will embark on a journey that will result in their being made a pariah.

10. Why do people traffic in this distortion? Perhaps some genuinely believe it because they have not seen classrooms like Christine's. Some perhaps mistake the benign and beneficial authority of a teacher with authoritarianism—the abuse of authority. But for others it is a selfish act. They use words like “carceral” to describe it, to exonerate themselves from responsibility. No one doubts that ours is an education system that systematically constrains the opportunities of poor and minority children. For some, making their own protest is the priority; their goal is to make it clear that they are not responsible. Unfortunately, shouting slogans doesn't solve problems. I prefer to solve the problem and make classrooms better even if it opens me up to simplistic and self-serving calumny.
