hoping they will have useful responses. This allows you to let students do more of the cognitive work, and build a culture where the strength of students' thinking is more visible to their peers and where being *Cold Called* is as often as not a sign of the quality of their work. “Hunting” for answers in this way and remembering whom to call on eight or twelve minutes later demands more of working memory than almost any teacher has available in a busy classroom. It requires *Active Observation*.

But *Active Observation* is not just taking notes. It's deciding what you should see and then looking carefully for whether you see it. It's thinking about what mistakes might occur and being ready to respond. Crucially, Julia's ability to observe and assess what's happening begins with the exemplar she's planned (technique 1, Exemplar Planning) and that she carries with her as she goes. To observe effectively in real time, you must think through what you'll look for in student work beforehand.

Let's focus in on how Denarius uses his exemplar in the clip *Denarius Frazier: Remainder*, which we began discussing earlier. You'll notice that he's making tiny, quick notations as he circulates, for example, in the following image.
