hold it up to show their teacher. Often teachers use small erasable whiteboards to do this, as Dani Quinn's students do in the video *Dani Quinn: Show Me*, shot at London's Michaela Community School. Notice Dani's consistent upbeat cue for students to show their work (“Hold up!”) and the way she makes reviewing the boards easier by going row by row and asking students whose work she's reviewed to put their boards down. She offers individual feedback to students as she scans, building a *Culture of Error* by keeping her tone similar whether students got it wrong—“Sam, what's five times five?”—or right—“Bianca, very good.” The impressive number of names she's able to use lets many students feel seen and acknowledged, and we see her reinforce the procedure when she asks for “Boards down” and a faster response.8 Finally, Dani does an excellent job of not just gathering data but adapting instruction to that data: “A few mistakes. We'll do one more …”

Slates needn't be done only with whiteboards—you might have students hold up their work in other ways: sketch a line on graph paper; write a sentence defining *verisimilitude*, perhaps “double spaced” so you can read it a bit easier from afar; add a margin note on page 26. Although scanning the responses might not be quite as simple in those cases, the approach can still be revealing (and effective in supporting accountability).

## TECHNIQUE 11: AFFIRMATIVE CHECKING

A final tool that can help you use observation to check for understanding, *Affirmative Checking*, involves the strategic use of checkpoints where students must get confirmation that their work is correct or on target, and that they are
