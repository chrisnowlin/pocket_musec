# Sadie McCleary's Reflections on Knowledge Organizers

I almost always include vocabulary terms in my *Knowledge Organizers*. These are the foundational terms students should know in order to increase the rigor of the questioning possible by the teacher and increase the quality of student responses. Note that these are not the only terms/concepts students will learn this unit! They will continue to build on these and complicate their ideas. These are simply a starting place.

Studying is a skill! Remember to teach students to study with *Knowledge Organizers*. This needs to be modeled and students need to practice—even simple vocabulary drills.

- Take two minutes several times in the first unit to show students how to fold their KO to hide the definitions and self-quiz. Follow this up with several minutes of students doing their own silent self-quizzing and an oral drill or recall quiz.
- Partner quizzing: Provide opportunities for students to quiz one another for one to three minutes in class. Explicitly name for students that this should be replicated at home with a family member or friend. Model partner quizzing for students, and set clear times for when partners should switch who is quizzing whom. If time allows, follow up partner quizzing with an oral drill or recall quiz. You can grade these sometimes but you don't need to. Research on frequent low-stakes assessment shows how effective this is without grades.
