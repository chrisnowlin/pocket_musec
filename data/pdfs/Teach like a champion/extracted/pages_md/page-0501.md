Let's say you ask, “What was the purpose of the first Continental Congress?” Maybe one or two students raise their hands. Others sit passively. Most students, probably, are engaged in a subtle and silent calculus: *Is the teacher really expecting us all to raise our hands?* Your first goal is to build a norm, the expectation that most of the class probably will. You can do this by “elevating its visibility,” Peps McCrea points out, by increasing an action’s “profusion” (the portion of students who do it) and its “prominence”—how much people notice the behavior and believe that you value it. “One hand,” you say out loud. “Two hands. Now three.” You are building momentum. Perhaps a fence-sitter, a student who had something they might offer but who was warily reading the classroom norm, now raises her hand. “Four hands,” you say, smiling, relaxed, not rushed. You want hands but especially hands of students who have taken their time. “Five,” you say. “Thank you, Kesha. Thanks, Lance. Nice. Now I’m starting to see those hands.”

Your message is: I notice and I care when you raise your hand and, increasingly, many of your classmates are doing it.

In the video *Josefina Maino: I Need More Hands*, you can see Josefina narrating the hand-raising in her math classroom at Astoreca School in Santiago, Chile. “What does it mean that an inequality has a ‘set of solutions’?” she asks. Here’s the scene, after she’s allowed perhaps four or five seconds of wait time:
