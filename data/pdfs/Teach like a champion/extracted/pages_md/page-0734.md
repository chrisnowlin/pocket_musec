reminds us that the purpose of these techniques is not so much to forestall negative behavior as it is to socialize positive and productive behaviors that help young people thrive in all the settings of their lives. Our goal is to create something good, and one outcome will be the prevention of the negative behaviors along the way.

## TECHNIQUE 52: WHAT TO DO

Giving directions is one of the most overlooked aspects of teaching both because of its mundanity and its familiarity. We are forever doing it but it feels about as profound as ordering a sandwich.

But poor directions—those that are unclear or meandering (which is to say unclear and compounded by length and repetition)—have consequences that are far-reaching. For example:

- My directions aren't clear, so some students don't follow through on them and we waste time.
- My directions aren't clear, so some students do the task incorrectly and are confused.
- My directions aren't clear, so some students are confused, and I get mad at them for not doing what I wanted. They feel my sense of frustration and are frustrated in return.
- My directions aren't clear, so students assume I'm flustered or not prepared or am not really all that clear on what I want.
- My directions aren't clear, so some enterprising student takes advantage of the gray area and pretends to misunderstand by doing something else entirely. Wouldn't that be funny!
