Below you can see an example of all three from science teacher Vicki Hernandez's class. Her class was discussing photosynthesis.^14 As you can see, the right answer is clearly marked. And in the box the student has explained to herself why that answer is right. She's also explained why each wrong answer is wrong. This is a student with deep understanding of the question and a record of it for future reference.

Certain poisons are toxic to organisms because they interfere with the function of enzymes in the mitochondria. This results directly in the inability of the cell to...

A) Store information. (nucleus DNA, nucleus stores DNA)

B) Build proteins. (proteins ≠ energy) Ribosomes do this!

C) Release energy from nutrients

D) Dispose of metabolic wastes (cell membrane does this, not mitochondria)

C is correct because the function of mitochondria is to provide the cell with energy, and so toxins would interfere with the release of energy.

In the video Vicki Hernandez: Let’s Make a Note, Vicki starts with appreciation for the student whose work she has Show Called, praising him for correcting his own answer. She also has the work clearly displayed on her document camera, so the students can see Vicki make notes on the correct answer. She's seen that the common error was a confusion around grass, so she asks them to lock in what they learned about what confused them. “Grass,” she says (and writes), “is a producer because it is a plant and goes through photosynthesis.”
