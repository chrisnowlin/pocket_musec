evident in Christine's packet. Each question or activity stands out as something new and discrete as opposed to a muddled mass of undifferentiated responses to the novel. Students can see clearly that they are moving dynamically from activity to activity.

One effective tool I've seen in some packets—particularly London's Michaela Community School—is line numbering. If you're spending a significant chunk of time discussing a passage, it's often worth copying it into your packet with line numbers added to ensure more continuity, quality, and efficiency in discussion. The following image shows the first paragraphs of Linda Sue Park's novel *A Single Shard* with line numbers added. Reading this, Carlise can easily draw the class's attention to Tree-ear's use of the phrase “later today” in line 9 rather than everyone using up their working memory searching for the spot “in the middle of the third paragraph” she's referring to. Afterwards, the teacher might draw students quickly and easily back to a different spot: “What does the narrator's reference to ‘the well-fed of the village’ in line 3 tell us?”
