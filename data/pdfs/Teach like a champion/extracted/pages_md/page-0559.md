| Participation Method | Notes | Examples |
|----------------------|-------|----------|
| **4. Chat to All – Wait Question**<br>Wait | - Definition: Students type their responses into the chat to everyone and submit the responses on the teacher’s cue.<br>- Prior to Asking Questions: Make sure that chat setting is set to “everyone publicly” and that students are clear on the whether the question is a speed question or wait question. When giving directions, you should make sure that student have selected “To Everyone” in their chat menu.<br>- Uses for Speed Questions: Longer responses, responses that require more processing time, and data collection | - “For this question, I would like for you to prepare your response in the chat, but wait until I say ‘go’ to hit enter. We are going to give everyone a chance to get their thoughts together before we submit.”<br>- “Take two minutes to prepare your response in that chat. Wait to hit enter until I say go. Wow, nice work team. Take 1 minute to scroll back up and read the thoughts of your teammates.” |
| **5. Cold Call** | - Best Practices Mirror “In-Person” Instruction: Cold call should be positively framed and used as a frequent participation method in the class. Language around “cold call” should communicate an invitation to the discussion or to the class verbally.<br>- Reminding Students of the Zoom Operations: Especially early on in the school year, we should make sure that Cold Call questions include a prompt for students to “unmute” themselves.<br>- Uses for Cold Call: Operational questions, low-level CFU questions, constructing discussion based off of chat responses | - “Why did Scout respond that way? Take 15 seconds to think about it. Maria, please unmute yourself and start us off with your thoughts.”<br>- “Caleb, please pick up or “when he...” unmute yourself, continue reading.”<br>- “Rosa, you sent a beautiful response in that chat. Please unmute yourself and share it!”<br>- “Alex, please unmute yourself and build on that.” |
| **6. Hand Raise**<br>Raise Hand | - Execution Notes: Ask students to volunteer to respond to a question by raising their hand in the participants menu.<br>- Narrated Wait Time: Use the narrated wait time prior to selecting a student so that all students have a chance to develop their response and navigate to the participants menu to raise their hand. | - “Number 3 was a little bit tricky for all of us. I am looking for someone to raise their hand and walk us through their thought process for it. If you’re feeling confident, remember you can raise your hand by clicking participants and then ‘raise hand’.”<br>- “We have one minute to jot down our response. Raise your hand in the participants menu, if you want to start off our discussion. Okay, I got 2 hands already. How 3 of us really nice work team!” |
| **7. Show Me** | - Definition: Students share their responses visually on-screen.<br>- Hand Signals: Explain to students how to show their answer choices using their hands (1 for A, 2 for B, 3 for C, 4 for D)<br>- 2.0 – White Board: Have students write their answer to a problem or a question on a white board. On your cue, have students show their responses.<br>- Uses for Show Me: Note that “Show Me” is very similar, in terms of outcomes, to a wait question or a private chat question. Use Show Me when you want to collect data from the entire class in a quick and efficient way. | - “When I say go, I would like for you to show me a 1 if you chose A, a 2 if you chose B, a 3 if you chose C, and a 4 if you chose D. Take 20 seconds to choose your answer go. Go!”<br>- “I would like for you to write your answer big to fit on your whiteboard. When I say go, show me your response.” |

In the video *Madalyn McClelland: Maps*, you can see not only how Madalyn uses the icons to guide her own teaching but how to make participation transparent to students.

Interestingly, this is an idea that can also be productive in the classroom. One of my favorite schools in the UK, Torquay Academy in Torquay, has similarly developed a set of icons that they share with students. They also share the intent of the teaching techniques they represent so that when they see the “Wait Time” icon they know that the purpose is to think deeply and not rush, and so forth.^18
