where the first half of the novel takes place and where the civil unrest post-revolution sets the plot in motion. There's a second one outlining the history of California, where the second half of the novel takes place, and describing key social events of the era: the Great Depression; the Okie Migration; the Dust Bowl. This demonstrates the double power of a *Knowledge Organizer*. Students will understand the book more—and enjoy it more and bring more insight to it—by knowing these things as they read it, and they will end the unit with knowledge of those events that they will carry forward. Both novels are now truly historical fiction as opposed to stories set in past times that the students reading can scarcely understand.
