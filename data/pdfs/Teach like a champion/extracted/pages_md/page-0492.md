# Using Perception-Based Questions: What Differences Do You See?

Sensitivity Analysis is a close reading tool my colleagues and I describe in Reading Reconsidered Curriculum in which the teacher presents a sentence from a text to students and asks them to compare it to a similar version they've created with one or two small changes.

The idea is for students to analyze the impact of word choice or syntax by comparing subtly different examples. The key is in the subtlety of the differences. Research in comparative judgment suggests this is an especially effective way to unlock understanding of nuance and complexity. Students perceive a slight difference in tone or mood and so develop an ear for language.

In testing out lesson plans for the Reading Reconsidered Curriculum we developed, I volunteered to teach a lesson on the novel *Esperanza Rising* that included a sensitivity analysis question, and I struggled badly.

The sentence in question described the protagonist's experience in a dust storm.

The original was:

> “Thousands of acres of tilled soil were becoming food for *la tormenta* and the sky was turning into a brown swirling fog.”

The alternative was:

> “Thousands of acres of tilled soil were blown into the air and the sky was turning into a brown swirling fog.”
