Another observation: when you learn to shoot a basketball, the first bit of advice you get is to square up^17 to the basket. It's hard to get the right result if you're not facing your objective fully. With human communication it's similar. You show what is important to you by facing it. Glance over your shoulder and say to David, *please put that away*, and you are saying that what you are facing with your shoulders is still more important to you. That may be fine for an off-hand reminder. Or it could help you surreptitiously give a student a reminder you want to keep as private as possible. But if you are not getting the follow-through you need from students, try facing them more intentionally as you give directions or if you must repeat them. In this way the orientation of your body reinforces the importance of your words.
