use to understand and support your students' ability to read complex texts. There are times when independent reading can take other forms—students should choose and read books on their own, of course; sometimes they should struggle with a challenging text and reflect on what they initially missed or didn't fully comprehend. But AIR reminds us of how important it is to constantly assess students as independent readers so we understand the experience they are having when they read.

And AIR can help students understand the reading process better too. Like Kirby, you may opt to be transparent about your decision-making process (for example, “My sense is that we're still figuring Steinbeck out. We're going to keep reading independently in small chunks until we're a bit more familiar with his style and voice,” or “This description of photosynthesis includes a lot of technical vocabulary, so you're just going to read the first two paragraphs on your own.”) It also allows for celebration of success, as we can see in Kirby's clip: “That was a challenge, and you did it.” This language of celebration is a way to embrace challenge and show that success brings additional autonomy: “We're really starting to get Steinbeck. I'm going to challenge you to do more on your own,” or “You did a great job summarizing the section on photosynthesis—let's see how you do in this next chapter, which goes a little deeper.”
