One interesting scene in Robert Pondiscio's outstanding *How the Other Half Learns*<sup>16</sup> involves Success Academy's CEO Eva Moskowitz observing a class with a group of school administrators.

Students are calculating the number of volleyballs in a group where the total number of balls is known, as well as the number of balls that are *not* volleyballs. The teacher calls on a child named Dmitri to discuss his work.

“The total number of …?” she loudly signals to the class to answer.
