*Matters* ([technique 18](#)). Her *Circulate* ([technique 25](#)) is outstanding and her *What to Do* directions ([technique 52](#)) keep everyone on task: “Text in front of you, please.” There’s a great *Stretch It* ([technique 17](#)) in there too when she asks, “What are we imagining when we read the word ‘clubbed’?” “Neanderthal,” replies an astute student. It’s a good answer and Gabby honors it by following up with more questions: “Why?” and when he explains, “So that links to the character of Hyde how?” The message is: The reward for right answers is harder questions, though his answer—he notes that Hyde has devolved—is a sort of reward too.

*Sarah Wright*: Reading *Esperanza Rising* with her fifth-grade boys at Chattanooga Prep in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Sarah proves that the best way to have students take pleasure in learning is to have clear procedures (*Chapter Ten*, Procedures and Routines) so things work right and students know how to do things. Her students write first before bursting into a *Turn and Talk* ([technique 43](#)). Her circulation here allows her to overhear some great answers and she honors one student by *Cold Calling* him. Notice also how when Akheem reads his sentence, everyone in class is looking at him and showing with their body language that his words matter ([technique 48](#), *Habits of Attention*). Notice how the *Turn and Talk* snaps to life because she has such a clear in-cue for it, because students have practiced it, and because they know every classmate is going to join in enthusiastically along with them. Notice how the *Turn and Talk* ends quickly when needed because she also has a clear, practiced procedure for calling the class back to order. Notice how she has a system that she uses to let students celebrate one another’s work and how, as eager as they are to answer, the boys don’t shout out their answers; this lets Sarah *Cold Call* and give Akheem just the right chance at just the right time. The joy is
