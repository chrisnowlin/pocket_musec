# Online Lessons

Managing the limitations of working memory is one of the core challenges of teaching in any setting. Online, its challenges are magnified since we are always competing against potential distractions and because attention is fractured online. So while one of the silver linings of online instruction was how easy it was to gather data by, say, asking students to respond in the chat, the challenge was at times that this yielded *too much* data. The “velocity of data” was often too much for working memory: thirty student responses scrolling upwards across the screen is more than teachers or students can process—and the result was at times everyone chatting and no one able to read or attend to the comments with adequate attentiveness. The video *Harley and Clayton: Slowing the Data* shows Rachel Harley and Hasan Clayton, two teachers at Nashville Classical Charter School, providing an elegant solution. They ask students to chat that their responses only to them, not to “everyone,” then curate a few exceptional answers from the chat stream and post them where the class can read and reflect on them with more deliberate focus. There's really no reason teachers couldn't curate a set of interesting examples from students and present them to guide and inform discussion in a similar manner in brick-and-mortar classrooms as well.

One corollary of the fact that working memory is both powerful and limited is the realization that every task you
