won't always happen. But often when you ask for a slightly more elaborated answer or a more formal form of expression students sense the expectation and willingly add more details.

Alternatively, you could challenge James by suggesting an interesting way to start the sentence, ideally one that uses challenging syntax:

*Teacher:* James, what's the setting of the story?  
*James:* Oakland, California.  
*Teacher:* Good. Can you tell me again starting, “The novel is set …”  
*James:* The novel is set in Oakland, California, in 1968.

Again the teacher here has praised the thinking before asking for a revision, but the revision has also caused James to use “set” as a verb. This involves taking a noun and turning it into a verb—a challenging task—and applying usage that is less common verbally than in writing. Both are likely to help expand students' syntactic control.

You can see this play out in the video *Jasmine Howard: Unique Output*. Jasmine asks a student to define a function. “It has an output and it's unique,” the student replies. Her answer is largely correct. At least it is if you make some assumptions about what her pronouns refer to, so Jasmine pushes her to clarify:

“‘It has its own output and it's unique,’ she repeats.  
‘What's the ‘it’?’  
‘The input,’ her student replies, and Jasmine now asks for a complete sentence with an encouraging tone and demeanor that affirms the answer: “Go ahead and say that in a complete sentence.” In other words, she's asking her
