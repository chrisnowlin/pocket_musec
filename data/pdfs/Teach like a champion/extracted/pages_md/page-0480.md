What’s the rigor of the content? Is there Desirable Difficulty?

**Participation Ratio:** How many students are thinking, how much of the time?

Understanding this diagram requires defining two terms for describing student thinking during the lesson. The first is Participation Ratio (PR). I've put this on the x axis. It asks the question of who participates and how often. If I ask a question and everyone in my classroom answers in their heads or picks up their pencil and starts writing out thoughts, my Participation Ratio is high. Everyone in the class is answering my question. If it's a discussion and everyone is listening carefully to the speaker my Participation Ratio is high. Potentially it's higher still if I occasionally divide my whole group discussion up into pair discussions (Turn and Talks); suddenly more people are participating. My PR is high.

If I was measuring my Participation Ratio, though, I'd have to measure it over the course of the whole lesson. A minute
