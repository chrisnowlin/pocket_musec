student to the correct answer. Your second goal is to keep your *Break It Down* rigorous by providing the smallest viable cue.

Take a look at the following figure. If you can provide a cue like A that makes the student fill in most of the gap, your student is likely to learn and remember more than if you use a cue like C. “Memory is the residue of thought,” Daniel Willingham tells us. There's more thinking to remember in A.

Both are more challenging than D, which solves the problem without any *Break It Down* (by giving the answer or having another student give the answer). Again, you want the smallest cue that will work in consideration of pacing, timing, rigor, and so on. A is desirable if you can, but you won't always be able to. You'll have to use D sometimes, too.

## Question: Where is the story set?

Desired answer: “In the northern part of Alaska near the Arctic Circle.”

Initial student answer: “The setting is in the North.”

- **A**: Roll back: “You said, ‘In the North.’”
- **B**: Narrow or eliminate false choices: “You said, ‘In the North.’ Where in the North? Are they speaking Russian?”
- **C**: Provide the first step: “Well, they’re on a journey, right? To take the ‘oblong box’ from one place to another. Where are they traveling from and to?”
- **D**: Responses that don’t *Break It Down*:  
  “The setting is in the northern part of Alaska near the Arctic Circle, Clara.”  
  “Can someone else tell us the setting?”
