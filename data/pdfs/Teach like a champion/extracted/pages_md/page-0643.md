Another general rule is to be precise with time. Imagine you're a student and are participating in a *Turn and Talk*, but you don't know how long it's going to last. Forty-five seconds? Two minutes? Fifteen minutes? Not knowing this basic information can make it hard for you to gauge how much to say. Do you need to get the basic idea out and stop so that the other person can broach an idea? Is your conversation about deep analysis? Should you ask your partner a thoughtful question? Informing participants of the time parameters helps them manage their comments and their conversations to make the best use of time. Saying “*Turn and Talk* to your neighbor for the next thirty seconds” means just share some initial ideas. Be quick and then let the other person talk. Saying “Two-and-a-half minutes to discuss the role of setting. Go!” provides guidance; further, your use of specific and odd increments shows that your time allocation is careful, specific, and intentional. It tells students that time and its careful use matter to you, so they should matter to them. If you use a stopwatch to track those time allocations, it also helps you keep yourself accountable for moving the lesson forward and not losing track of time while checking in with a stuck or highly engaged pair, for example. And, over time, it will help you make smarter and more specific time allocations for *Turn and Talks*.
