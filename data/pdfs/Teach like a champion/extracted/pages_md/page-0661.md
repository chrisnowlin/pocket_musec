# Charting Aids Discussion by Aiding Memory

One way to help students stay on topic and validate their classmates' ideas is to help them to remember them. This may seem trivial but we know that people can only keep one or two ideas in working memory at a time and that recall fades quickly. Thirty seconds after hearing Kimani's great idea it will be hard for his classmates to remember exactly what he said. You can write a brief reminder on the board. “Jonas alarmed by feelings bc he doesn't know what they are” or perhaps simply “‘Jonas doesn't know what feelings are’—Kimani.”

Now students can think about Kimani's comment. Remember it. Refer back to it. Even with several comments made in between, they can use *Habits of Discussion* not just to build off of the most recent comment but those that happened several minutes ago. It provides the assist when a student says, “I'd like to build off of what Kimani said earlier about Jonas not knowing what feelings are ...”

You can do this on the whiteboard, the overhead projector, or chart paper. It's important to note that it is different from *technique 22, Board = Paper*, because students may well *not* be writing what you write. You are the memory scribe. Their job is to listen. Here's Jessica Bracey doing that as Omar comments in her Keystone video.
