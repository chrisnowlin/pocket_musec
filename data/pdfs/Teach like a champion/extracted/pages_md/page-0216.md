should use it! But it's also important to recognize the value in balancing it with a broader array of data-gathering approaches. Using *Active Observation* therefore includes also using alternative approaches to giving every student immediate feedback as you observe because alternative observational tools can create balance and emphasize different aspects of the learning process. The following chart provides three options for *Active Observation*:

| **Option 1** | **Option 2** | **Option 3** |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Sometimes called "Aggressive Monitoring." Teacher tracks progress of and gives immediate feedback to each individual student. | Teacher gives feedback to the group after tracking and completing observations (and does not provide individual feedback during observing). | Teacher gives feedback (and makes observations) focused on specific individuals (and not the whole group). |

Though Option 1 is often excellent, one limitation—and therefore one reason to occasionally balance it with other approaches—is that the need to get to every student can lead to rushed feedback or a tone that feels hurried or transactional—it feels like the teacher's goal is to get around the room.7 This can crowd out time for questions, for example. There may be times when you ask students to hold their questions—the data could be more important—but there will also be times when it's valuable to respond and linger. Sometimes it's valuable to give feedback right away but sometimes it's appropriate to let students struggle for a bit and not receive immediate feedback on their progress.

It's worth considering that Option 1 could be adapted. You could, for example, still try to observe and gather data from every student's work but *not* try to give live feedback as
