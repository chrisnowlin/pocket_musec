enables you to better gather data through *Active Observation* and reinforce students who've done good work.

In the great majority of cases, the *Do Now* is silent work. I can imagine an occasional exception for peer-to-peer quizzing with a Knowledge Organizer or some other form of retrieval practice, but only occasionally and for a class with a well-established routine.

With regard to the content of the *Do Now*, I favor three options. The activity can (1) preview the day's lesson (you are reading *The Jacket*, and the *Do Now* asks students to write three sentences about what they'd do if they thought someone stole their little brother's favorite jacket); (2) review a recent lesson (you recently introduced three new vocabulary terms and want students to review the definitions so they don't forget them); or (3) build background knowledge that will be necessary for the upcoming lesson (you are reading *Number the Stars* and want students to read a short nonfiction excerpt about rationing during World War II). Though all options can be powerful, I want to take a moment to highlight the particular benefits of using the *Do Now* as an opportunity for regular, low-stakes review.

In *Small Teaching*, James Lang notes that “a brief (and ungraded) multiple-choice quiz at the beginning and end of class and one additional quiz before the exam raised the grades of all students by a full letter grade.” These brief low-stakes “quizzes” (you can choose if you grade them or have students grade against a key) actually lowered students' anxiety on end-of-unit assessments, because they reported feeling more prepared. Of course, as I discuss in *Retrieval Practice* (*technique 7*), this is because, as Lang puts it, “Every time we extract a piece of information or an experience from our memory, we are strengthening neural
