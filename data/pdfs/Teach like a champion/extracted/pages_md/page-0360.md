## Reading Symbolically: The Woods

The forest is a mysterious place; in legends and fairy tales, the woods are usually full of mysterious creatures, symbols of all the dangers which young people must face if they are to become adults. “Hansel and Gretel,” “Snow White,” “Little Red Riding Hood” — in these and many more tales, the forest is a place away from civilization, a place of testing, an unexplored land full of the unknown.

The forest is often the home of the outlaws or a place where typical rules no longer apply. Since its trees obscure the light of the sun, it’s often a place of literal and figurative darkness and mystery. Entering the forest can be seen as a metaphor for entering the unknown. Sometimes it is also a place of opportunity and transformation—the hero enters the forest and discovers something about him- or herself.
