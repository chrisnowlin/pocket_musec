Consider: You flash a slide showing cell structures and organelles like the following illustration on the screen and begin explaining it to your class:

## Animal Cell

- Nucleolus
- Nuclear Membrane
- Nucleus
- Cytoplasm
- Golgi Apparatus
- Ribosome
- Lysosome
- Endoplasmic Reticulum
- Cell Membrane
- Mitochondrion

As you talk you hold in your mind a thousand implicit understandings: That the cellular organisms are enlarged relative to the size of the cell in the image to make them more visible. That the colors are for the purpose of demonstration, and aren’t realistic. That actual cells are three-dimensional. That animal cells feature huge variety in their shapes, and few if any animal cells are actually *this* shape. That the images of the organelles are supposed to represent cross-sections. That the mitochondria aren’t in
