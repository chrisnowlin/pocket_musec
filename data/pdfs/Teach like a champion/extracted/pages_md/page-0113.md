1. If you're new to Teach Like a Champion and don't follow all the wheres and whys here, don't worry. You can get full explanations of all the terms and variations in *Cold Calling* (technique 34) in Chapter Seven.

I actually have no idea who the Kardashians are—I only know they're famous. Also, if you're wondering about taking advice on humor from me, my teenaged kids tell me I'm truly hilarious (“OMG, Dad, you're so hilarious” [insert withering stare]).
