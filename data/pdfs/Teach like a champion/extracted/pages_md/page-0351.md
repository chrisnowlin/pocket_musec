and interesting work until we think they have mastered the basics.”

Sticking with kids, telling them you're sticking with them, and constantly delivering the message “I know you can” raises a student's self-perception. Here are some phrases that can help frame challenge when you present it to students:

- “This is one of the things you're going to take real pride in knowing.”
- “When you're in college, you can show off how much you know about ...”
- “Don't be rattled by this. There are a few new words, but once you know them, you'll have this down.”
- “This is tricky. But I haven't seen much you couldn't do if you put your minds to it.”
- “I know you can do this. So I'm going to stick with you on this question.”
- “It's OK to be confused the first time through this, but we're going to get it, so let's take another try.”

## Notes

1. Tone and praise are also age-related variables. This means that if you teach kindergarten, make a fuss over every tiny moment. If you teach tenth grade, go a bit easy.

2. This is one of a hundred reasons why behavioral culture matters. It is not enough to eliminate negative behaviors. We have to install and instill learning-positive behaviors among students so the classroom culture supports changes in behavior that benefit young people. Please
