it's important to recognize that *Habits of Discussion* rely on *Habits of Attention*. She is attentive and focused during both the *Turn and Talk*—when she tracked and nodded and encouraged and so locked into her conversations—and while Adriel was speaking. Her answer reflects strong attention habits.

Finally, check out Denarius Frazier's tenth-grade math classroom at Uncommon Collegiate High School in Brooklyn (*Denarius Frazier: Solutions*). Using *Habits of Attention* with high schoolers might seem daunting but the results are surprisingly similar. As you watch, I hope you note the high “ratio” in the classroom—it's the students who do the work. They actively engage in tasks both challenging and worthy. The level of the discussion is high. You might also note the open-mindedness of Vanessa, who begins to defend her answer, recognizes her mistake, and changes her thinking without defensiveness. Look at the still image of the moment when this happens. The eye contact—tracking—is important and so are the facial expressions. The moment happens because she is receiving strong signals of psychological safety and belonging throughout: her classmates' eyes and faces and body language say *We are with you*.
