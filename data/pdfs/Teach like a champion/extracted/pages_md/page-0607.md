students' work, that of most students, is full as you might expect of invented spellings and the like. But it is also full of a capacity for complex syntax that's far ahead of what you might expect. Soon their spelling and handwriting will catch up and their syntactic control will serve them well. In Jeremiah's words, they'll be writing *juicy* sentences from the outset.

In the video *Sarah Fischler: Exhausting Six Months*, you can watch seventh-grade science teacher Sarah Fischler using AOS. My team and I love the range of prompts she uses—and the frequency, as well as the playful but practical specificity of her time limits (a great example of the effectiveness of precise time limits). Sarah's students process constantly in writing in a variety of ways and with pleasure.
