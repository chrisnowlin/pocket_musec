# TECHNIQUE 54: MAKE EXPECTATIONS VISIBLE

As a rule of thumb, the more visible the action you ask students to execute, the easier it is for you to see whether students follow through, and the more that students implicitly recognize that you can clearly see what they do. This makes them more likely to do what you've asked and makes it easier for you to hold them accountable. Some of the most effective teachers have a way of making “observable directions” fun and tactile, increasing both the incentive to follow through and their ability to manage.

A colleague of mine, David McBride, used this idea to help a teacher who was struggling at the time to keep students focused. Drawing on *Radar* and *Be Seen Looking*, David asked the teacher to script three points into his lesson when he would give a clear task and ensure that he got 100 percent of students doing it, even if at first this was only temporary. He wanted to start by showing the teacher that students would and could follow his directions; that a room where everyone was productively engaged was within his reach.

David asked him to:

- Give an observable direction.
- Use *Radar* to scan intentionally and strategically to see whether it's being done.
- Stand in Pastore's Perch while scanning.
- Narrate the follow-through of at least two students who've done right away what the teacher has asked.
- Warmly correct at least one student if students were not meeting expectations.
