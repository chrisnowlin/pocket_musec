and many of us (myself included) have taught lessons where questions, once asked, hang unanswered in the air. Or generate a smattering of half-hearted and obligatory responses: the same few students (or student) calling out the first thought off the top of their heads.

Just because we ask questions doesn’t mean students answer them, in other words—or think much about them. So it’s worth using a few tools to refine questioning and ensure that it supports strong Participation and Think Ratios. As a starting point, let's differentiate two different reactions that students may have to questions, both of which can be valuable in the classroom.

First, there is thinking. Ideally everyone in a given class would think rigorously about every question you ask and attempt to answer it *in their minds*. This is a different activity from answering the question and sharing their thinking *aloud*. Answering and thinking are separate variables.
