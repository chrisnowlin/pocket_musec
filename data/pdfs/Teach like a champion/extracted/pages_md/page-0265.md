think?”) or use a nondirective reveal (“Here's what Martina wrote. What do you think?”) A directive reveal can help you be more efficient and focused, ensuring a tight, productive discussion on what’s *most important*. Giving students more latitude via a nondirective reveal can allow students to simulate the revision process more closely and to identify issues they consider relevant. Noting what students observe unprompted can also be a useful source of data.

Arielle Hoo's clip is a model of subtlety. The reveal, “Let's take a look at Tyler's work. Tyler, please explain what you did to check,” is a model of *Culture of Error*. She's calm and steady but withholds the answer. Only after Tyler's description of his own work does it turn out that he's checked his work in a way that a few students have forgotten to do. Then there's further study by the class of all the reminders of strong mathematical habits that his solution provides.
