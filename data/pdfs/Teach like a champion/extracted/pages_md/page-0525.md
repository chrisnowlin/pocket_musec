Taylor: Well, no, you need to square your radius.  
Ms. Martin: Ah, yes. Thank you, Taylor. Well done.  

By breaking up a single question into pieces and *Cold Calling* multiple students, Ms. Martin keeps all students on their toes; in making questions contingent on one another, she causes students to attend even more closely to what the others say. Not only were six students engaged actively where only one had been before, but all students were likely thinking through the answers silently, given the plausibility of being called on. And because the students are all working together toward answering a question, unbundling tends to build a positive cohesive culture. It makes school a team sport.  

Follow-on is the term for sequencing a series of more open-ended prompts that similarly cause students to listen to, reflect on, and expand one another's answers. Let's say Ms. Carrasco is teaching her students about plate tectonics.  

Ms. Carrasco: Jennifer, what does this tell us causes earthquakes?  
Jennifer: The plates.  
Ms. Carrasco: Doing what?  
Jennifer: The plates colliding.  
Ms. Carrasco: Can you develop that a bit, please ... Jalen?  
Jalen: Well the plates collide and sometimes one slides under the other but other times they scrape alongside each other.  
Ms. Carrasco: Good addition, Jalen. One thing we haven't talked about is the role of pressure. Teana, can you add to that?
