I often ask students to annotate diagrams, definitions, or other information in their *Knowledge Organizers* during lessons. This adds to their understanding of the core concepts and makes the organizer into a living document. It also draws their attention. If we're getting out our organizers to add a note, it must be something very important.

You can build the organizer into the fabric of your class. Reference it frequently. If a student is stuck, ask them to check their organizer first, often before they raise their hand in class. You can make it part of their desk setup: at the beginning of class every students should have out homework, notebook, *Knowledge Organizer*, and pencil.

## An Example of One of Sadie's Knowledge Organizers

Knowledge Organizer #4  
Unit I – Matter: Properties of Gases & Calculations  
NAME: _________________________, PD: _____

### Vocabulary:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Heat | Form of energy that flows between two samples of matter due to the difference in temperature. Heat flows from a sample with higher average kinetic energy to a sample with lower avg. kinetic energy. |
| Temperature | The measurement of average kinetic energy of a sample. Units used: K, °C (converted between using equation C below). |
| Kinetic Energy | The energy an object possesses due to its motion. Calculated using equation B shown below. |
| Pressure | Force exerted by the substance per unit area on another substance. The pressure of a gas is the force that the gas exerts on the walls of its container. Units used: atm, kPa, mmHg |
| Volume | Amount of space occupied by a three-dimensional (3-D) object. Units used: mL, L (liquid), cm³ (solid) |
| Velocity | Speed of an object (primarily particles in this case). Units frequently used are m/s or cm/s. |
| Mass | Measure of the amount of matter in an object. Units used: g, kg |
| Particle Diagram | Visual representation of the particles of a substance, where the particles are shown as dots. Allows us to represent samples in different phases. |

### Equations:

| Equation | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Equation A: Combined Gas Law: $\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}$ | - $P_1$ = initial pressure<br>- $V_1$ = initial volume<br>- $T_1$ = initial temp<br>- $P_2$ = final pressure<br>- $V_2$ = final volume<br>- $T_2$ = final temp |
| Equation B: Kinetic Energy: $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ | - KE = kinetic energy<br>- m = mass<br>- v = velocity |
| Equation C: Temp Conversions: °C + 273 = K | - °C = Celsius<br>- K = Kelvin |
