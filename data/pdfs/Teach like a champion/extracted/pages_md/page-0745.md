And here's Eric Snider making the directions for independent work both visual and oral and *leaving a version of them up for students to reference throughout the activity* so they can always reorient.

**Independent Work until 1:30**

- [ ] 1. Read pages 195-199. It's finally the girls' time to perform! Find out what happens and be ready for... a plot twist.
- [ ] 2. Answer questions 4-6 in classwork.
- [ ] 3. Take Socratic Quiz.
- [ ] 4. Make sure **ALL** questions are answered then → “Turn In” Classwork.
- [ ] 5. Begin IR for your reading log. We will come back together at **1:30**

**What Alonzo and Eric are doing ties in to cognitive science.** “Spoken words disappear,” Oliver Caviglioli points out in his book on the science of visuals, *Dual Coding*. This is called the **Transient Information Effect** and it reminds us that anything that is exclusively verbal is harder to study and remember and often exerts a heavy load on working memory. This has instructional implications but also cultural ones: we should put reminders everywhere if we want people to remember.

**But our reminders should be simple!** Limiting extraneous information is another piece of advice Caviglioli provides about visuals. Graphics are most useful when spare and focused: simple and without extraneous info; for example, fewer colors are better and line drawings are often better than photos if we want people to focus on the content and process the key ideas.
