Responding to Asagai, Beneatha says, “You didn't tell us what Alaiyo means … for all I know, you might be calling me Little Idiot or something.” This reveals her skepticism.

Her teacher might respond. “Nice choice of supporting evidence, now see if you quote Beneatha indirectly rather than directly.”

The student might then revise:

> Beneatha reveals her skepticism by asking Asagai what Alaiyo means and suggesting, perhaps with a hint of cynicism, that it might mean “Little Idiot.”

The teacher, circulating around the class a few minutes later, might follow up with a further Stretch It: “Nice change. How do you think it changed the argument to quote the play indirectly rather than directly?”

## Ask for a Better Word

Students often begin framing concepts in the simplest possible language. Offering them opportunities to use more specific words, as well as new words with which they are gaining familiarity, reinforces the crucial literacy goal of developing vocabulary. Pushing for the inclusion of vocabulary can also develop students' confidence in their thinking and support mastery of new words.

I mentioned regarding the video of Michael Towne's class that the first student to answer seemed to me to be anticipating Michael's follow-up question and deliberately using the most technical vocabulary he could. You could imagine a day previously where a student might have said, “The dye spreads faster in the warm water.” To which Michael might have said “Can you use a scientific term?” or “a term from our Knowledge Organizer,” or perhaps, “a more precise term for that idea.”
