5. A word that might be useful  
“Who can tell Michael a word that might be useful to him in solving?” [Michael, the word *distribute* is really important here.]

An alternative to cuing is to allow students to ask questions as part of a *No Opt Out*. I got this idea from Michael Towne, one of the winners of the 2014 Fishman Prize, a national award given to top teachers in the country. “If I ask them, ‘What's the speed of the magnetic flux here?’” Michael told me, “I want them to be able to say, ‘I'm actually not that clear on what you mean by magnetic flux.’” To Michael that's a sign of maturity, so he explains to students that they always have this option and encourages them to use it. But the sequence still ends with a *No Opt Out*: “OK, now that we've clarified what magnetic flux is, what's its speed here?”

You can see a really engaging example of cuing in the video *Derek Pollak: Fifth Root*, shot at North Star Academy High School in Newark, New Jersey. Notice Derek's warm and encouraging demeanor as both he and then a peer provide cues to a student solving a problem during retrieval practice.

I mentioned previously that there were variations to the *No Opt Out* technique. I'm going to map them out a bit more now.

## Options for What Happens Before the Return

Go to another student and ask for the answer. Return.  
“Not quite. Who can tell us the definition of juxtaposition?”
