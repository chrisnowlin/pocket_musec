**Online Lessons: Remote *Turn and Talks***

*Turn and Talks* were critical to engagement during remote teaching. They allowed us to boost the ratio and let often isolated students talk to one another. But online *Turn and Talks*—breakout rooms in pairs—were also doubly challenging. The video *Ben Esser: Shorter Turn and Talk* shows how Ben solved many of these challenges. Students have written answers first, so this *Turn and Talk* is an opportunity to rehearse and explain ideas. Perhaps for that reason the time allocation is short, and Ben emphasizes this fact by telling students it will be short. He wants them to come out ready to talk to the whole group. Being clear about time helps students gauge how long to talk and making sure they have plenty to say helps overcome some potential awkwardness of being in a breakout room without much to say. You can also see that he's managing turns here—the person with the name that comes first in the alphabet goes first. He also addresses the possibility of students being off task by dropping into a few pairs conversations. In fact, Ben *Cold Calls* Suraya to speak because he dropped into her group and thought she had a strong idea. She most likely knows this and sees the *Cold Call* as an approval of her thinking.
