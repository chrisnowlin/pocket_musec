Own and Track is a critical time for Circulation and Active Observation, as you provide time for students to explain the right answer, appropriately denote the wrong answer, and label their errors. You'll see that in Vicki's clear scan at the end of her clip—she knows the bit of information about grass is critically important for her students, and so she takes the time to make sure everyone has jotted it down.

Another way to help students engage with the content as they correct their answer is to have them reflect on the steps that they did (or did not) take, as Paul Powell did at the end of the video *Paul Powell: Show Call*. Paul and his students have established the correct answer for a multiple-choice question. “Are you showing your work even on a multiple-choice question?” he asks. “Pick your pencil up and give yourself a check for each one of these steps.” By building in this written reflection for students, Paul not only ensures they walk away with a clear understanding of what is right (and what is wrong); he also guarantees that their papers reflect the process they took to arrive at the accurate answer; a valuable engagement task turns into a record of lasting value. Some things you could say to help students Own and Track include:

- “Give yourself a check for every one of these steps that you got correct. If you're missing one, make a note to yourself.”
- “Circle answer B and write a margin note that explains that it uses the wrong operation.”
- “Draw a line through the [insert grammar mistake] and rewrite it correctly in the space in the margin.”
- “Make your paper look like mine.”
- “Reread your response. Add at least one piece of evidence from our discussion to better support your answer.”
