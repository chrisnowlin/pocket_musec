9. Am I just talking about adjustments in discourse for certain Black and Brown kids? I am not. To varying degrees, learning to use the standard form is an issue across the majority of young people in society. Part of standardization is not about cultural but about generational differences. Young people speak like young people and their parents want schools to ensure that they can speak in a way that is more like how the adults talk. Any student's language habits, in other words, are informed by a combination of influences and factors and it may be a false judgment to assume that a teenager's way of speaking is a representation of his or her culture. For all you know it makes their parents crazy. Most of us went through a process as teenagers of learning to speak in a way that was accessible to the broadest swath of society.
