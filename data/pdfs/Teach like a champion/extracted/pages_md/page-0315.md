Sarah—and effect—what do you do to push the learning even further when you start to get answers like this.

“I used elimination,” Sarah says. “After I eliminated the x and the y I saw that it ended up with 0 = 2, but that's not true, so that's a false statement.”

“Awesome,” says Arielle before moving on to a question about a pair of coincidental lines.

Jaheem volunteers to answer this one and again we hear complete thoughts with technical vocabulary rather than simple one-word answers.

“The way you can figure out how many solutions [the system of equations] has is by looking at the graph, and you'll find that it has infinite solutions,” Jaheem says.

Which is true. And which causes Arielle to ask, “How do you know?” She wants to challenge Jaheem but also make sure the right answer is not a lucky guess. She wants to understand how he approached the problem and ensure he (and other students) can repeat the process on other problems.

Moments later, noting a tiny slip-up Arielle asks, “By two?” This allows him to catch his own error. “You'd multiply it by four and you would get the same equation,” he clarifies.

“Talk about the result,” Arielle continues, subtly giving him the opportunity to connect what he's said to other pieces of knowledge and thus build schema (connected bodies of knowledge).

Jaheem keeps going: “The result will be 0 = 0, which is infinite solutions.”

“Great,” says Arielle, “because it's what kind of statement?”

“A true statement.”
