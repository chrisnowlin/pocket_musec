# TECHNIQUE 10: SHOW ME

Another useful tool in making effective and efficient observations of student work involves flipping the dynamic in which a teacher works to gather data about a group of students whose role in this process is largely passive. Instead, in *Show Me*, students actively present the teacher with visual evidence of their understanding. This gives teachers a way to quickly assess an entire class's understanding, more or less at a glance, and has the added benefit of often being enjoyable to students.

*Show Me* could mean students presenting answers on mini-whiteboards, as you'll see in the video *Dani Quinn: Show Me* (which we'll study more in a moment) or holding up a number of fingers, each representing the answer to a multiple-choice problem on cue, as Brian Belanger/Denarius Frazier do in the video *Belanger/Frazier: Show Me Montage*. They've cut out the need to circulate around the room to gather data but still are able to get a strong sense for where everyone in the class stands.

Here are the basic criteria for a good *Show Me*. It should ask students to (1) *present objective data*, (2) usually *in unison*, and (3) *in a format that the teacher can assess at a glance*. It's worth taking a moment to go a bit deeper into each of these criteria.

*Present objective data:* When Denarius and Brian ask students to respond by showing on their fingers which answer they chose, they are presenting their actual answer, not their (subjective) opinion about their own understanding. Self-report, as we discussed earlier, is notoriously unreliable. So versions of *Show Me* that take subjective self-report data and make it visible (e.g. “Tell me if you understand: Thumbs up, thumbs down, thumbs
