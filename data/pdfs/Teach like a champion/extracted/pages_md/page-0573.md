## Building Ratio Through Writing

The amount and quality of writing students do in your classroom is one of the most important determinants of their academic success—possibly the single most important thing—so one of the simplest and most powerful shifts you can make is to increase the amount of writing—especially high-quality writing—your students do. Why ask, “Who can tell me what Jonas has just realized about what it means to be *released*?” and have one or two students answer, when you could say, “Please tell me what Jonas has just realized about what it means to be *released*. One minute to write some thoughts in your packet. Go!” This shift means every student answers and every student battles to frame the thought in precise syntax. Teachers often define a sentence as “a complete thought.” By having students write more, we cause them to push their ideas from vague notions or developing ideas to complete thoughts; to practice developing complete thoughts is to practice perhaps the core task of thinking.

Increasing the amount of writing in your class raises important questions, however, from the practical (*How do I get them to actually write?*) to the philosophical (*Where in the sequence of learning is writing most valuable? How can I build a process-oriented culture of revision into my writing?*). For that reason, this chapter looks at techniques that can help you use writing for maximum effect on both Participation Ratio and Think Ratio.
