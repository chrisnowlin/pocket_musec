success and lets a student have something to be genuinely proud of at the end of the sequence, the better. This turns setback to triumph and I've often noticed that many of the most able teachers with *No Opt Out* follow up right away to add a challenge or an extra practice, much as you'll read about in *Stretch It* ([technique 17](technique_17)).

Consider this very basic interaction:

*Teacher:* What's three times five? Carson.

*Carson:* Eight!

*Teacher:* It's not eight. Who can tell Carson what operation he used?

*Jalani:* He used addition instead of multiplication.

*Teacher:* That's right. So, Carson, what's three times five?

*Carson:* Three times five is fifteen.

*Teacher:* Yes, good. And what's five times three?

*Carson:* It's fifteen, also.

*Teacher:* Good. And four times five?

*Carson:* Twenty.

*Teacher:* Oh, you've got it now! I can't stump you.

This teacher not only gives Carson extra practice at a skill he struggled with but also engineers the experience so the sequence ends with Carson showing that his success was no fluke. He answers several questions correctly; his teacher can't "stump" him. Consider how this sort of interaction turns the tables after a "wrong" answer. Or consider how some small tweaks of this interaction could make it not only positive but more rigorous:

*Teacher:* What's three times five? Carson.

*Carson:* Eight!

*Teacher:* It's not eight. Who can tell Carson what operation
