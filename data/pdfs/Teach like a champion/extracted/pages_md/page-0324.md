argument as inadequate; instead ask for the proof and give the student an opportunity to reflect, refining her response and potentially revising herself.

You might ask students for evidence to support a student's assertion that Beneatha is struggling to express her identity in *A Raisin in the Sun*. Or for evidence of times when she seems more and less confident in what she believes. Or you might say, “Yes, I think that's true. But many people remark on the way she subtly changes in the course of the play. Can you find me some evidence to support or refute that reading?” Or perhaps, “Yes, I think that's true, but can you find me an example of how that struggle becomes more intense when her mother is present?”

## Ask Students to Integrate a Related Skill or Additional Knowledge

In the real world, questions rarely isolate a skill precisely. To prepare students for that, try responding to mastery of one skill by asking students to integrate the skill with others recently mastered.

*Teacher:* Who can use the word *stride* in a sentence?  
*Student:* “I stride down the street.”  
*Teacher:* Can you add some detail to show more about what *stride* means?  
*Student:* “I stride down the street to buy some candy at the store.”  
*Teacher:* Can you add an adjective to modify *street*?  
*Student:* “I stride down the wide street to buy some candy at the store.”  
*Teacher:* Good. Now, can you add a compound subject to your sentence?
