narrative notes if she needs them, which allows the tool to gather both quantitative and narrative data about the work.

Story Problem: Yedidah is making friendship bracelets for her birthday party. At the store, beads are sold in packs of thirty-five. She decides to buy six packs. When she gets home, her mother suggests using twenty beads on each of her friends' bracelets. How many complete bracelets can Yedidah make for her friends?

| Point of Error                                                                 | Number of Students Making Error |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Error 1:** Scholars incorrectly multiply $6 \times 35$                        |                                 |
| **Error 2:** Scholars incorrectly use the total of 210 beads in the final step of the problem |                                 |
| **Error 3:** Scholars create a bracelet with less than 20 beads                  |                                 |

In this example the teacher is more focused on error trends rather than individual student progress. During class she'll make a hash mark each time she sees a mistake, regardless of who made it, so she can sum things up quickly at the end of her circulation and determine what she needs to review. Again, there's room here for narrative detail. Denarius's tracker likely looks similar to the one we see above.

This exemplar also offers insight into how teachers plan when they will gather key data. Notice the difference here between Error 2 and Error 3. Clearly these are two pieces of the same math problem, but the teacher has divided the errors into two separate rounds of observation. Julia Addeo
