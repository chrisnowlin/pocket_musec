solutions to the painting’s component problems are modeled. Figure out the light and shadow on the house in the foreground first. Then sketch the figures in the field and explore how you’ll use shading. Several times, perhaps. Then put them together.

An exceptional example of this was provided to me by Nina Troiano, then an Art teacher at Troy Prep Middle School in Troy, New York. I was always stunned by the quality of student work in the hallways at the school and observed several of Nina’s lessons. Typically she would build skills and knowledge progressively through a series of exercises leading up to a final piece. Here’s her process for breaking down the process of painting formation as she described one project to me.

“It’s a pretty academic first day,” she said. “We started by reading about the artist in the *Do Now*—maybe two paragraphs with questions to answer. We discussed her approach and then we looked at one of her drawings.”
