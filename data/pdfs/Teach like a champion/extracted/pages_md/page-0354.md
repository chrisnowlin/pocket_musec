We want them to know we are prepared and value their learning. They will not be passive; there will be very little downtime.

So consistently starting quickly and with a quality task is important. A predictable familiar activity that students know how to do lets them get started actively and with confidence.

The first step in a great lesson, then, is a *Do Now*—a short pencil-to-paper activity that is waiting for students as they enter the classroom and that they can and should start without any directions from you.

The secret is the “without directions from you” part. A procedure that does not require guidance from you beyond posting the task beforehand benefits you as well as your students, especially when you are teaching a full schedule. It gives you the chance to take a final glance at your lesson preparation document, make sure the classroom is arranged how you want it, connect with an individual student or two, or pass back some papers—perhaps even
