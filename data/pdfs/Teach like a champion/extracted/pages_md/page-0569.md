# Notes

1. [https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/willingham_0.pdf](https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/willingham_0.pdf).

2. It's also worth noting that desirable difficulty assumes that students are successful in their thinking most of the time. We remember things better if we are able to answer, and less so, for the most part and for most of us it seems, if we cogitate on giant abstract questions of being and nothingness.

3. The term schema gets used vaguely and a bit recklessly —often in the classroom with very young students in a way-too-jargony way—so I tend to avoid it. I just refer to knowledge, which is really what it is: a lot of knowledge that is connected.

4. That is, if you know something you will begin to connect it to other things you are thinking and learning about and this will become a web of connections and facts. Arguably this is the difference between knowledge and information and expresses why schools should be intentional about how they present knowledge—they can shape the organizational structure as much as the amount of knowledge that students learn (see technique 5, *Knowledge Organizers*). Ironically, though, those who claim that schools teach isolated facts not only don't appear to have been in many schools recently but appear to be lacking in knowledge about how human cognition works. As a side note, I am pretty sure the phrase “even isolated facts don't stay that way for long” comes from something Daisy Christodoulou has written but I have been unable to find a citation. Still, this is a good opportunity to recommend her book *Seven Myths About Education*.
