Turn and Task. You can also turn your Turn and Talk into a Turn and Task. You can see a great example of this in the video Gabby Woolf: Keystone. After a round of FASE Reading (technique 24) with her class, Gabby assigns students to read the next section of text to one another in pairs. It's partner work but the work they do together is something other than discussion. That might mean saying: “With your partner, come up with a list of three words to describe the setting,” or “With your partner, write a hypothesis describing the results you think you might see from the experiment.” “With your partner, solve problem 4. I'll Cold Call some of you to hear your answers. Go!” Having a clear deliverable emphasizes accountability a bit more because the task is clearer. If it's a written task, it serves this purpose even better: you can observe the writing as you circulate. You can ask students to “share what you wrote.” You can even collect the work to review it later.
