learning and content. Their relationships with us are the means to achieve that goal. The strongest and most productive teacher relationships are built by establishing a triangle in which we connect to students and (help to) connect them to content.

Students

RELATIONSHIPS

Teacher Content

We are conduits, in other words. If students do not develop a valuable relationship to the things they study in school, their relationship with their teacher will not have accomplished its full purpose. This challenges us to resist the desire to be the center of the story; the goal is not to be loved and remembered forever but for students to take away a belief in their own capacity, to value the process of learning, and just possibly love or at least appreciate deeply the ideas of science, math, music, or literature. ActiveObs is a primary tool teachers can use to help relationships serve this purpose.
