range of them in their writing even if they don't know their names. As you're probably already thinking, this exposure strengthens students' ability to comprehend these sentences when they come across them while reading complex text.

## Sentence Starters and Sentence Parameters

Let's take a second to define three types of AOS sentences. The first use “sentence starters,” specific verbiage that students must use at the outset of their writing such as:

> Summarize the data from this graph in one complete well-written sentence that begins with the phrase “Over time ...”

At first glance, a prompt with a sentence starter may appear to be easier to respond to than a prompt without one because it contains scaffolding, but in many ways the opposite can be simultaneously true. The sentence is now pushed into new and often unfamiliar syntactical territory. Without being pushed and stretched in such ways, students aren't likely to expand their repertoire of syntactical forms very much. Now, imagine the different sorts of phrases with which you could ask students to begin a sentence:

- “Growing exponentially, ...”
- “The line that expresses the function ...”
- “The relationship between ...”
- “In the long run, ...”
- “When the line approaches vertical, ...”

Each of these has a different effect on student writing and thinking, pushing them not only into new syntax but potentially into new thinking.
