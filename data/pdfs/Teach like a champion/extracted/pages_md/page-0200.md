*Format* even further. In addition to directing students to answer in the same space, you can also ask them to lift up the key pieces of the answer that you are looking for as you circulate. “Box the equation you used to calculate the sum,” or “Underline the appositive you added to your thesis.” These additional directions not only make it easier for you to focus on the most important aspect of student work when time is of the essence, but also heighten student awareness of the most important variable to include in their work. Boxing the remainder or circling the active verbs in their topic sentence helps students to focus and prioritize.

My team and I recently tried to use *Standardize the Format* ourselves at a workshop on CFU. The topic was “Reject Self-Report” and the activity was a series of case studies: six transcripts from classroom situations where a teacher had initially relied on student self-report to assess mastery. Teachers in the workshop were asked to rewrite cases, scripting their questions to better gather data about student mastery in lieu of self-report. Workshop participants were asked to complete several of the scenarios over the course of a few minutes. At the bottom was an additional section where people were asked to identify and rewrite a case from their own experience. The page we provided looked like *Figure 3.1*.
