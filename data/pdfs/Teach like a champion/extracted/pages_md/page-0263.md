An alternative might be a quiet explanation to a student to remind them of the purpose: “Your work is really interesting. I'd love to share it with the class.” You might do more such framing early on in your use of *take*, transitioning later to more unnarrated takes. But less is often more. There are definitely times to say, “Oh, this is great. I can't wait to share it,” but if you have to say it every time you wish to “take” a paper, it becomes nearly meaningless.

In some cases (it's early in the year and you're building culture; or a student may be self-conscious about the mistake they've made) a bit more of an “ask” is appropriate with the take, but often a simple statement of purpose preceding the question is helpful: “I'd love to share this with the class, OK?” is even better than “Can I share this with the class?” A smile or some positive
