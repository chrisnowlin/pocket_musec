One of the keys to Sadie's success is her decision-making about switching activities. Students keep thinking about the same idea, but they engage it in different ways. I call this idea **Change the Pace**. It helps to achieve the proper balance of “fast” and “slow,” flow and focus, momentum and attention.

## Changing Activity Types

1. Assimilating knowledge directly from sources, such as direct teacher instruction or reading a text
2. Participating in guided practice
3. Executing skills without teacher support, as in independent practice
4. Discussing ideas with classmates
5. Reflecting independently on an idea—thinking quietly and deeply, often in writing
6. Reviewing previously mastered material to encode it in long-term memory (i.e. *Retrieval Practice*)

All six activity types are important, and students should engage in all of them frequently so they get a well-rounded mental workout.

A couple of caveats in thinking about these activity types:

All six types of activity are important for students to engage in regularly, but choosing among them requires consideration of more than just what feels right in a given moment. How and when you use one type of activity affects how well others will work. Knowledge assimilation, for
