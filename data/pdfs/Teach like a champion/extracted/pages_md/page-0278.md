### TECHNIQUE 15: NO OPT OUT  

Consider this moment from a recent lesson in Denarius Frazier's tenth-grade geometry class (video: Denarius Frazier: Quadrilateral). His students are about to attempt to prove that a given shape is not a square, but first Denarius pauses and asks the class, “Before we get into that, what is the definition of a square?” It's important that every student start with sound knowledge of the basics.  

He calls on Aaron, who responds: “All four angles and all four sides are equal.” It's a solid answer, one that might suffice in another class, but Denarius says, “Hmm … that's about 80 percent of the way there. It can be a little more specific.” It's a bit of a *Right Is Right* moment (technique 16)—Denarius is holding out for *all-the-way right* rather than *mostly right*, even while acknowledging the value of Aaron's answer.  

Next Denarius calls on Anastasia, who has raised her hand. She adds precision: “A quadrilateral with four 90-degree angles and four congruent sides.” At this point, with the fully correct answer having been shared, many teachers might simply move on and return to the proof. But Denarius has something else on his mind, and he instead returns to Aaron: “Back to you, Aaron. What was the difference?”  

Aaron says, “I didn't add the quadrilateral.”  

“The quadrilateral and …?” asks Denarius.  

“And the degrees of the angle,” Aaron finishes.
