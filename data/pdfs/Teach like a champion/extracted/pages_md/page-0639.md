were generated get analyzed, studied, clarified, and confirmed—maybe even edited, revised, and prioritized—in a public way, so that students see what was good, what was better, and possibly what was wrong.

Here, then, are three key “after” activities to make sure that *Turn and Talk* brings rigor and high standards to your classroom.

## Whole-Class Analysis

Teach students that the first idea is not always the best idea, that developing a strong answer often requires going back through your initial thoughts and considering them in light of further criteria or analysis. This might sound like “Let's look at some of the ideas we came up with and see which ones make the most sense,” or “Let's try to use what we know about friction to test a few of our ideas and see if they were accurate.” Or you could try something like “Let's put a couple of these on the board and list the evidence that seems to support (or not support) some of our ideas.”

## Whole-Class Discussion

Use *Turn and Talk* as the starting point for a deeper whole-class discussion that builds on and stretches students' initial thinking. This might sound like “Let's build on the thinking we've started,” possibly with a coda, like “As we talk, feel free to add to what you already wrote down.” Or you might try “Now let's try to put our ideas together to come up with a few ‘best’ examples.” Or, finally, you could just acknowledge that the initial *Turn and Talk* was a warm-up: “Now that we've started to discuss some ideas, let's take a look at the sentence together and see if we can make sense of what it means.”
