*irritable.* “Oh, wait till you see how irritable Esperanza is on this train ride,” she says, intrigue in her voice, and after a few crisp *What to Do* instructions—“Packet in the corner [of your desk], text in front of you. Ready to read on page 72,” she's reading and the chapter is underway. Her segue has students looking eagerly forward to see how irritable, in fact, Esperanza will be. Preparing a segue means looking ahead to connect content and helping students to see how the parts of a lesson fit together via a very transitional phrase. The segue becomes a through-line for students, to make the lesson feel more like a whole, and the things they do more connected.

“I almost always start our reading with a question that connects the prior day's reading to this day's,” ace literature teacher Sarah Wright told me. That form of a segue “is like a hook,” she noted. “You've got the hands going up … and then … every student is on the edge of his seat because you've made the connection to what they care about. The more you can make those connections, the more you are connecting the brain neurons and helping students remember and build on all of their knowledge as they are going through the text.”

By writing segue statements, you shape how students will experience the overall lesson by telling them—and yourself—the story of how the discrete pieces come together in one unified, objective-driven whole.
