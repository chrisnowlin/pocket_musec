Just about the simplest model of the mind possible.

(factual knowledge and procedural knowledge)

Among the things it points out is the fact that working memory is the means through which we consciously interact with the world. Any thinking we're aware of doing, such as critical thinking, occurs here.

The power of working memory is prodigious. It has allowed humankind to discover penicillin, create the musical *Hamilton*, and conceptualize String Theory. But beyond its immense power the most dominant characteristic of working memory is its tiny capacity. We struggle to hold more than one or perhaps two ideas there at a time. Here's a way to test the limits of your own working memory. Reread the first two sentences of this paragraph. Then close the book and try to copy out the sentences verbatim on a piece of paper. You will likely struggle to remember even those two simple sentences. That's you coming up against the limits of your working memory. You just can't hold much information there at any given time. A version of this problem—cognition being constrained by the limits on working memory—occurs over and over for learners. If we
