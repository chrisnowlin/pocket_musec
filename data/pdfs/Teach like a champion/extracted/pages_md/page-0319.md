capable of than when we say, “I think you are smart. I think you are capable of science.” Kids want proof, and in these classes, they get it, seeing themselves succeeding in the face of real challenges.

What Arielle and Michael show us is that by treating correct answers as a step in the learning process, *Stretch It* can help students build long-term memory, expand and connect pieces of knowledge into cohesive schema, and build curiosity and confidence. The greater challenge brings about a cultural change.

*Stretch It* involves:
- Making a habit of asking follow-up questions in response to successful answers
- Asking a diversity of types of follow-up questions
- Building a culture around those interactions that causes students to embrace, and even welcome, the notion that learning is never done

## Other Advantages of *Stretch It*

*Stretch It* can often also help you learn more about student thinking and ensure the reliability of correct answers. In Jaheem’s case, for example, I read Arielle to be deliberately making sure he understood the initial answer he gave and why it was true, challenging him to accurately explain his correct response rather than accepting it at face value and moving to another student. This allows you to avoid false positives—moments when luck, coincidence, or partial mastery can lead you to believe that students have achieved a more complete understanding than they really have.

Further, in classes in which there isn’t necessarily one “correct” answer—analyzing complex literature, for
