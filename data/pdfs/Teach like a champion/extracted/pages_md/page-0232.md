# TECHNIQUE 12: CULTURE OF ERROR

In a recent article about his development as a musician, the pianist Jeremy Denk observed a hidden challenge of teaching and learning: “While the teacher is trying to … discover what is working, the student is in some ways trying to elude discovery, disguising weaknesses in order to seem better than she is.”10

His observation is a reminder: If the goal of *Checking for Understanding* is to bridge the gap between *I taught it* and *they learned it*, that goal is far easier to accomplish if students *want* us to find the gap, if they are willing to share information about errors and misunderstandings—and far harder if they seek to prevent us from discovering them.

Left to their natural inclinations, learners will often lean toward the latter. Out of pride or anxiety, sometimes out of appreciation for us as teachers—they don’t want us to feel like we haven’t served them well—students will often seek to “elude discovery” unless we build cultures that socialize them to think differently about mistakes. A classroom that has such a culture has what I call a *Culture of Error*.

Those teachers who are most able to diagnose and address errors quickly make *Check for Understanding (CFU)* a shared endeavor between themselves and their students. From the moment students arrive, they work to shape their perception of what it means to make a mistake, pushing them to think of “wrong” as a first, positive, and often critical step toward getting it “right,” socializing them to acknowledge and share mistakes without defensiveness, with interest or fascination even, or possibly relief—help is on the way!
