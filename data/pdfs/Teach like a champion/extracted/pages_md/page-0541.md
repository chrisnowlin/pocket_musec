our identity from our community even if community is often fleeting in our society.

*Call and Response* is a tiny piece of the fabric of classroom culture, but done well it can create moments that build a sense of togetherness. Doing things in unison reminds us that we belong to a group. This is why *Call and Response* is motivating and why it is inclusive. It briefly but viscerally makes everyone in the room a part of something collective. Just maybe these moments feel a bit like the choral singing that is universal to societies and religions around the world.

It’s worth observing that *Call and Response* can evoke this feeling only to the degree that the response reinforces togetherness, that is, students are truly in unison. That’s why in-cues are so important. Christine’s is the same each time she uses it. It’s clear, crisp, and distinctive. If it’s not clear what she is asking students to do and the cue is ambiguous, students might hesitate to follow through. Or not follow through at all. And then the momentary power of “all of us with one voice” is lost.

“The next word is caustic. Caustic on two—one, two …” Christine says, elevating her voice to make the cue distinctive in another way. The response is crisp and energetic again because the cue is consistent.
