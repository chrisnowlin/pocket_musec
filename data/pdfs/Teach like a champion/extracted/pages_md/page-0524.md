who has *Cold Called* D'Juan to ask him how to find the volume of a cylinder. The class listens while D'Juan ably describes the necessary calculations, but they become increasingly passive participants to the exchange. Actually, D'Juan really knows his stuff and he proudly stretches out his answer so it's as thorough and methodical as it can be. Ironically this has a counterproductive effect on the class. The longer the answer goes on, the easier it is to tune out. Students realize they won't be answering this question.

Now, compare that sequence to this one, in which Ms. Martin unbundles the question:

Ms. Martin: How many variables and constants do we have to consider in finding the volume of a cylinder, D'Juan?  
D'Juan: Three of them.  
Ms. Martin: Good. Tell me one, Janella.  
Janella: Radius.  
Ms. Martin: OK, and D'Juan, is that a variable or a constant?  
D'Juan: Radius is a variable.  
Ms. Martin: OK, so what's the other variable, Carl?  
Carl: Height is the other variable.  
Ms. Martin: Good. So, what's the constant that we need, Kat?  
Kat: Pi.  
Ms. Martin: And how do we know it's a constant, Jameer?  
Jameer: Well, because it never changes.  
Ms. Martin: Good. So, Taylor, when I multiply my constant and my two variables, I get my volume, right?
