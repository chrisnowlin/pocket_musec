on prompting can help. In a follow-on, the teacher consistently asks one student to respond to something another student has said, whether or not the second student has volunteered to do so. Something as simple as, “Skylar, do you agree with Markus?” (asked in good faith and not as a “gotcha”; see *Cold Call* for more details) establishes the expectation that Skylar must always be listening well enough to be able to offer a reasonable response, even if only to say that he's not sure about a particular point. Expecting Skylar to be able to respond reinforces peer-to-peer listening and, importantly, reinforces that listening is an expectation no matter who is speaking—it is a courtesy not merely reserved for the teacher. Of course to build the habit of follow-on in discussion you could use it without the *Cold Call*. Skylar might have raised his hand and instead of simply calling on him by saying his name you might remind him of the expectation that he develop the previous comment by saying, “Skylar, what do you think of what Markus just said?”

Instead of asking a directive question like, “Skylar, do you agree with Markus?” follow-on prompting is nondirective, with the result that it disrupts the thread of the conversation less and avoids steering the second student's response, which in some cases is part of the purpose of discussion. A teacher who's using follow-on prompting might keep his students on their toes and listening to one another by using fast follow-on prompts five or six times per class—enough to be predictably unpredictable without breaking the flow of students responding directly to one another via *Cold Call*.

You can see Christine Torres doing this in the second half of her Keystone video. She asks students to opine on whether Kirsty is brave when she talks back to Nazi soldiers in a key scene of *Number the Stars*.
