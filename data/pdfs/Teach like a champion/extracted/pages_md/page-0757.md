This story of a classroom reinvigorated, and a teacher saved—he was at the point of giving up—began with making a simple direction more visible and thereby eliminating ambiguity.

You may have noticed that Denarius Frazier, who appears throughout this book and who is surely one of the most exceptional teachers I have met, begins his class in the video *Denarius Frazier: Check in with Your Neighbor* with almost the exact direction David asked his struggling teacher to use: “Pencils down and track me in three … two … one.”

## TECHNIQUE 55: LEAST INVASIVE INTERVENTION

Ironically, constant, time-consuming interventions intended to ensure that everyone is with you can sometimes make it all but impossible to teach. When instruction comes to a halt, whether it is because of a
