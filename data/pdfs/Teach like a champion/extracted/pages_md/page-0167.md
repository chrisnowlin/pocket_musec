## The Migration Crisis

A westward migration of farmers from the Great Plains happened just before Esperanza arrives in California.

**Great Depression**  
The stock market crashes in 1929, wiping out much of people's savings and devastating the economy. The unemployment rate reaches 25%.

**Dust Bowl**  
Overfarming on the Great Plains leads to massive dust storms that ruin farms. Tens of thousands of farmers and their families are forced off their land.
