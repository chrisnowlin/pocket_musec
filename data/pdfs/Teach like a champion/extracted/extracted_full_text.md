# A Slightly More Detailed Model

- Perception is complex
- Knowledge
- Critical thinking analysis
- WM is very small
- LTM is essentially unlimited
- It’s best when it’s organized so ideas connect

In my version I've tried to make working memory very small to remind you that its capacity is limited. But long-term memory is large. The dotted line suggests that as far as cognitive scientists know, it is all but unlimited. Not only does having more knowledge in long-term memory not make it harder to add something new there, it may make it easier. The more you know, the more connections you can perceive to new knowledge; this makes it easier to remember more of that new knowledge and gives you more connections to help you recall it. An expression among cognitive scientists is “things that wire together fire together.” If we think about them at the same time, recalling them will also happen in concert and, in an ideal case, remembering something from long-term memory will enhance recall of related concepts and ideas.

part, to organize our memories so that knowledge is connected to other facts, insights, and observations. This is how initially isolated facts become something broader that we call knowledge. Remembering something requires successful storage and successful retrieval, however, and the speed and ease with which you can find it is the critical factor in your ability to use it so again organized memories with lots of connections among lots of information are also more likely to have more ways to recall the knowledge they contain successfully.

I also added the idea to my model that perception is complex because one of the things that working memory does most effectively—help us to perceive the outside world—is much more complex and fallible than we think. Broadly, if working memory is overloaded—students will both perceive and remember less. The solution is to have knowledge encoded in long-term memory. Once information is stored there it can be used with very little load of working memory.

Of course, if working memory is underloaded there are also poor outcomes—boredom and reduced learning, for starters, but also lack of attention. The mind finds other things to do. So it’s critical to attend to and manage the amount of new information young brains work with. We want them constantly engaged and interested but not overloaded with more than they can manage. The science behind this is known as “Cognitive Load Theory.” It’s among the most important things for educators to know about. Sweller, Kirschner, and Clark, who are its foremost researchers, define learning as a change in long-term memory and observe that “The aim of all instruction is to alter long-term memory. If nothing has changed in long-term memory, nothing has been learned.”⁶ That’s why forgetting is so important to think about. You’ll find this concept in several of the new techniques in this book.

A last critical note on managing working memory: Sweller's *guidance fading effect* argues that experts and novices learn differently. Problem-solving environments where learners are tasked with inferring solutions rather than being provided with guided instruction work well for experts because they perceive these environments accurately and can quickly connect what they see to their vast background knowledge. For novice learners this does not occur. They are likely to perceive incorrectly or attend to low-value phenomena or use up their scarce working memory searching for the right information. With little knowledge on the topic in their long-term memory, they make far fewer connections. For novices, carefully guided instruction is far more effective. However, too few educators are aware of this distinction. They tend to presume what works for experts is therefore best for everybody. If it's how elite mathematicians learn, well then, let's give it to everyone. But in fact the guidance fading effect tells us that this is a mistake. “Students should initially be given lots of explicit guidance to reduce their working memory load, which assists in transferring knowledge to LTM,” Sweller writes. “Once students are more knowledgeable, that guidance is unnecessary and interferes with further development of expertise and should be faded out and replaced by problem solving.” Students in a K-12 setting are usually novices, although this definition is fluid. You can be an expert on *Macbeth* but a novice as soon as you start reading *Hamlet*. Or vice versa. Technique 21, *Take the Steps*, in particular discusses several issues raised by the interactions of working and long-term memory—“the curse of expertise” and the necessity of parsing out new information in steps with practice interspersed to address the capacity issues of working memory—but it will play a role throughout the book. You'll want to use retrieval practice frequently to install knowledge in long-term memory and use *Cold Call* to

ensure that everyone is getting the practice, for example. You'll want to ask students to write before discussions to reduce the strain on working memory of having to remember what they wanted to say, leaving them free to listen to one another's comments, for example.

A final point about the importance of long-term memory comes from a glimpse at what's known as the forgetting curve, which demonstrates the rate at which the typical person forgets things they've learned.

1. Your students first learn something. The 100% means they know as much as they knew.
2. Just minutes later they’ve begun forgetting it. They’re walking to their next class and it’s slipping away ...
3. An hour later what was clear to them is hazy. They remember only some of it.
4. By the next day if it’s new information they may have forgotten more than half of it.
5. Left unabated this process will continue. They won’t forget all of it but they’ll forget a lot.
6. Here your students recall the information after they’ve begun to forget.
7. After this review they begin to forget again but the rate of decay is slower.
8. And in the end they remember a bit more.
9. Your students recall the information again perhaps a day later.
10. After they review they start to forget again but they remember a late more each time.
11. You review with them a few days later.
12. Forgetting is always present but now it’s starting to stick.

The original forgetting curve was derived in the 1880s by the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus and plotted the actual rate at which he was able to remember a series of nonsense syllables after learning them. Though your students aren't learning nonsense syllables, the rate at which they forget what they have learned after they learned it is captured here, and the principle is broadly accepted by cognitive psychologists. The forgetting curve tells us that:

- As soon as you learn something, you begin forgetting it almost immediately.
- The rate of forgetting is often shockingly high; a few hours after learning something, people routinely remember only a small fraction of it.
- Each time you practice recalling what you know, the rate and amount of forgetting is reduced somewhat.
- Retrieving something back into working memory slows the rate of forgetting, but how and when the retrieval happens is important. (I discuss the details of retrieval more in *technique 7*, *Retrieval Practice*.)

That's immensely useful information, but forgetting curves can't tell us everything. They cannot tell you exactly what the rate of retention will be for your students generally or for a specific student at time A or time B for a specific topic you've taught. There are individual differences and factors in the learning environment, like how much attention students are paying and how new to students the information was, so the curve in most cases is theoretical but the theme is clear: We forget quickly and decisively as soon as we stop thinking about something and this process is always at work. Left unabated its effects are massive.

One way this is especially relevant is that what students appear to be able to remember at the end of a lesson does not represent what they really know, because the knowledge is not yet in long-term memory and forgetting begins when teaching stops. Students will begin to forget the moment they walk away from the class. Yes, use **Exit Tickets** to assess at the end of class. But know also that, barring further review, this technique will give you a false signal.² You will assume your students know how to add fractions with unlike denominators, but the test given the next week or at the end of the year will measure original

learning minus subsequent forgetting and you likely won't see what you had hoped to see. Managing forgetting is as important as managing learning (but isn't as visible).

This is especially relevant because only knowledge in long-term memory can be used without reducing working memory available for other tasks or eroding perception. If you ask a higher-order question, such as “Can you find another way to solve this problem?” then the answer is likely to be *no* if working memory is required in service of the calculations. If you want higher-order thinking or greater perception from students, help them to free their working memory at the moment you want them engaging with those tasks by making the skills they're using in the moment more fluid. This is why reading fluency and automaticity with math facts are critical—they are necessary because we don't want students thinking about these things at crucial moments, and fluency is the only way around the problem of working memory. You cannot perceive the author's tone if your working memory must be engaged to parse the syntax of the passage you are reading. When the foundational skills are not fully automatic it is very difficult to have profound or insightful thoughts during reading; bright and eager children can thus fail to have much to say about a passage they have read because their working memory was spent figuring out the words. Background knowledge is similar. You cannot make a leap to connect the prime minister’s attitude to his predecessor a century before unless that knowledge is in your long-term memory. “Looking it up on Google” actually requires your working memory.⁸

So what's the ideal number of interactions required with content if we want to encode it in long-term memory? Research suggests three or four but with many caveats and a lot of unknowns. In *The Hidden Lives of Learners*, Graham Nuthall, for example, finds that whether students

have had three interactions with material determines with 80 percent accuracy whether they will have learned it. That is, when he and his colleagues sorted through the things that were taught during a given class and determined whether students had encountered it and attended to it—either through the teacher's instruction or through some other interaction (with peers say)—they could predict with 80 percent accuracy whether students had learned the material. So predictive was this method that Nuttall hypothesizes it is at least possible that “other factors (such as the use of open-ended questions, feedback, advance organizers, relevant examples and analogies and the interest level of the material) ... may not be relevant to student learning except to the extent that they enhance the likelihood that students will encounter [and attend to] relevant content.”9

But of course even if Nuttall's research were conclusive, the complexity and familiarity of content, never mind the quality of the presentation of the material and the attentiveness of students could alter this number. Further, the idea that if you don't hear it all three times you won't learn it becomes especially important in light of research on the constancy of low-level distractions in many classrooms. So would the degree of fluency the content required. “Remembering it” can mean different things. With some knowledge it’s fine if I need a few seconds to pull it out of long-term memory. There's no rush. But some things I need in the blink of an eye and therefore, we can presume, require more iterations to ensure ease and speed of recall.

So how should this principle inform teaching decisions? You'll want to keep working memory free for students, so roll out new content in manageable chunks and be sure to constantly embed short sequences of practice and retrieval. *Cold Call* is a great tool for making everyone do the work of

retrieval, even those whom you don't call on. You can also use *Everybody Writes* and other forms of writing to cause student thinking to be more durably encoded in memory. Remember that thinking hard about things encodes them in memory. A good adage to remember is that students remember what they think about, so get the ratio high and build habits of attention and focus. Constantly have an eye to building knowledge (knowledge organizers can be helpful) and reinforce reading fluency with *FASE Reading*.

But also don't forget your own working memory. **Chapter Two** will help you use lesson preparation to free it for perceiving what's happening with students while you teach.

# Online Lessons

Managing the limitations of working memory is one of the core challenges of teaching in any setting. Online, its challenges are magnified since we are always competing against potential distractions and because attention is fractured online. So while one of the silver linings of online instruction was how easy it was to gather data by, say, asking students to respond in the chat, the challenge was at times that this yielded *too much* data. The “velocity of data” was often too much for working memory: thirty student responses scrolling upwards across the screen is more than teachers or students can process—and the result was at times everyone chatting and no one able to read or attend to the comments with adequate attentiveness. The video *Harley and Clayton: Slowing the Data* shows Rachel Harley and Hasan Clayton, two teachers at Nashville Classical Charter School, providing an elegant solution. They ask students to chat that their responses only to them, not to “everyone,” then curate a few exceptional answers from the chat stream and post them where the class can read and reflect on them with more deliberate focus. There's really no reason teachers couldn't curate a set of interesting examples from students and present them to guide and inform discussion in a similar manner in brick-and-mortar classrooms as well.

can manage to do with a minimal load on working memory allows you to use the remaining capacity for something more important. Fluent reading is perhaps the most important example of this. When students can read with fluency, their working memory is freed to think deeply about the text and their comprehension and ability to analyze increases.

This also explains why forming habits is so critical to learning. Making common, everyday activities familiar enough that we can do them without having to think about them makes it easier for us to do them—and therefore more likely that we will—and means we can free our minds up to think more deeply while doing them.

Your alarm goes off in the predawn darkness and your hand slaps the snooze button. You are in a half-waking state but soon standing at the sink, toothpaste on your brush; now the shower is running. Likely you are operating based on habit as your brain sleepily struggles to engage the new day. You do what you do because that's what you do. Your actions would happen more slowly and require more willpower and working memory (or might not happen at all) if they were not a habit. A familiar routine allows you to save your willpower for something else. Interestingly, research suggests that willpower is indeed finite in this way. Most of us can use it up. The term “ego depletion”10 describes this effect.

But something more happens as a result of habits. Likely some of the freest and widest ranging thoughts you will have today will occur while you are doing things you do out of habit: brushing your teeth; standing in the shower; perhaps driving to work. Your mind can do these things at very little cost to working memory; suddenly it is free to roam.

best question is to unlock last night's reading for your students.

Think about that in classroom terms. When you ask your students to write in response to something you've been reading or discussing, the more the process is established as a habit—“get out your Reader Response Journal and begin writing”—the more working memory is left over to think about the novel. You can see that play out in a sequence from Jessica Bracey's fifth-grade classroom in Newark, New Jersey, in the video *Jessica Bracey: Keystone*. Jessica says: “Tent your books. Question 87 in your Reader Response Journals. You have evidence in the text. Go!” Less than three seconds later, every pencil in the room is moving and, more importantly, every student is thinking deeply about the book. Compare that to Ms. Bracey's counterpart down the hall, Ms. Yecarb. Her classroom is the opposite of Ms. Bracey's. She thinks students get bored doing things the same way every day, so she often improvises new ways to make familiar tasks interesting. “Take a few minutes to write down your thoughts about why Maddie does what she does,” Ms. Yecarb says. “Write this down in sentences?” one student asks. “Yes,” says Ms. Yecarb. “On what?” another student asks. “Anything will do; scrap paper or your notes. Use a big purple crayon if you have one! Just try to think deeply,” Ms. Yecarb responds. “Is this OK?” asks one, holding up her notebook. “I can't find a piece of paper,” says another student. “Hey!” says a third. Her deskmate has been looking for a pencil in his backpack and has unsettled her desk.

It's not just that time has been wasted, though it clearly has. It's that continuity has been lost and focus squandered. By the time her students begin writing they will remember less about the text.

pencil and paper. Their insights will be scattered on the wind. And as they write, some part of them will be thinking about mundane aspects of task completion—Am I writing enough? Are other people writing more?—because responding in writing is not yet a habit. Ironically, in an effort to make it “interesting,” Ms. Yecarb focuses more attention on the task of writing and less on the book itself.

In Jessica's class, however, the ideas are flowing right away because there is both habit and procedure. There's a journal in everyone's folder; the folder is on everyone's desk, and pencils are in the trays. They have done this, her narrative reveals, eighty-seven times already, and so it is the equivalent to them of brushing their teeth. They can do it not just quickly but with their minds on bigger things—the book, in this case. Jessica's students are likely to think more deeply and creatively specifically because she's made the logistics of responding in writing a habit. You can see the benefits of this in the rest of the video. What you do out of habit takes less willpower—so every student is writing the whole time. What you do out of habit allows your working memory to be on things of substance—so students have engaged Jessica's questions in thoughtful and reflective ways. No surprise then that when she prompts them, every child's hand goes up eagerly. She has built a setting in which it is easy for their minds to engage and they have responded.

Habits, Charles Duhigg tells us in *The Power of Habit*, are the brain's way of saving energy, or allocating its energy to other more pressing things and they are just as important for teachers as they are for students. According to a study by social psychologist Wendy Wood and colleagues at Duke University, up to 45 percent of our daily behaviors are automatic.11 These make it easier to operate—thinking is hard work and the brain is always trying to conserve energy and focus for when it really needs it.

your lesson if you're thinking about brushing your teeth. But there are also habits you develop to help you think more deeply about what you're doing, like your process for lesson preparation. “I always prepare my lessons the same way,” Sarah Wright told me. The morning of the beautiful lesson in her Keystone video, in which she is so compellingly responsive to her students and seems to make every decision right, she “did the lesson as if I was a student, thinking it through from their perspective and writing out the answers I hoped I'd get.” Teachers like Sarah use a familiar and productive habit to prepare. That it's a routine means that she isn't thinking about how to get ready, but rather about what a good student answer looks like.

It's the same for students. We want to optimize their use of their thinking by filling their school days with two kinds of habits:

1. having a way of doing relatively unimportant things quickly and easily
2. having a way of doing important things well and in a way that channels the greatest amount of attention, awareness and reflection on the content.

It's obvious that we want consistent habits for the trivial stuff, in other words, but it's less obvious that we want consistent habits for the most important tasks. True, there are useful habits like how to come into a classroom and how to pass out materials. But academic habits—how to hold a discussion and how to write in response to text—are even more critical. What we do frequently benefits most from being done consistently, so building habits around paying attention well (*Habits of Attention*) and listening and building community during discussions (*Habits of Discussion*) pay massive dividends, as do consistent routines for different ways of participating (*Turn and Talk*, *Silent Solo*), not to mention expectations like putting hands up to answer (there's nothing worse than interrupting a student who makes a good comment to ask the student who

shouted out—again—to desist from shouting out) and down when others are talking (see *technique 29*, *All Hands*).

So build your classroom around procedures that become habits. Education writer Tom Bennett describes the shared habits that become a routine in a good classroom as being like a “superpower.” Habits, he writes, become part of students: “They behave the way they need to behave, without thinking. And that means … time and head space to think about the things you want them to think about—the learning. Routines are the foundation of good behaviour. They take time to communicate and imbed. But nothing is worth your time more.” Tom's right, of course. And what he says of positive behavior is even more true of thinking behaviors and academic habits. Ironically this often makes students happy because they take comfort—and sometimes pride—in knowing how to do things quickly and well. But either way, you will be transferring the focus of their working memory from how to do a task to the significance of the question. So a classroom infused with strong habits is usually a happy and scholarly place too.

There's a third, more subtle aspect of habit building that's worth thinking about, and a story from my visit to London's Michaela Community School, which serves students from some of the poorest sections of London, will help to explain why. At Michaela—which was recently the top-scoring school in England on at least one math exam—students at the school stand up at lunch each day and give thanks. I saw this myself on a visit in 2016.

After eating, the pupils were offered the chance to stand and express gratitude in front of half the school. Their hands shot into the air. All of them. Everyone wanted to be chosen to say thanks.

Students thanked their classmates for helping them study. They thanked their teachers for expecting a lot and helping

them. One student thanked the lunchroom staff for cooking for them (incidentally, cafeteria food in the UK is far superior to that in the United States and much more likely to involve on-site cooking). And still the hands shot up into the air. A student thanked his mother for everything she did to provide for him. He was perhaps thirteen years old and shared his appreciation in front of perhaps a hundred other teenaged boys, speaking haltingly but honestly about how grateful he was for how hard she worked and the sacrifices she made. You don't see that every day. The gratitude seemed to be endless and came pouring out of them until the teacher in charge said it was time to go back to class.

I found myself wondering about it for a while afterwards. Here were kids from some of the poorest sections of the city, kids who might have faced difficulty at home and on their way to school. Many had left (or even lived still) in places racked by violence and difficulty. But at Michaela, their days were punctuated not by someone reminding them that they had suffered or been neglected by society, but by the assumption that they would want to show their gratitude to the world around them.

What did this mean? Well, first of all, it gave rise to a culture of thoughtfulness. Everywhere I looked students did things for one another. In one class a student noticed another without a pencil and gave her one without being asked. In the hallway a student dropped some books and suddenly three or four students were squatting to pick them up. When students left a classroom they said, “Thank you” to their teacher.

Maybe thanking makes behavior worthy of gratitude more likely to occur. Students know their goodness is seen and valued, not just by their teachers but their peers. It spreads. Maybe at first it's due to the plausibility of appreciation but after a while it just takes on a life of its

own. People are kind and considerate because, at Michaela, it's what they do—it's their habit.

But the gratitude, I think, is as much about the giver as the recipient. Maybe that's the most important point. To show gratitude causes you to look for and then to see the goodness around you, and therefore to perceive a world full of goodness all around you. Which makes you happy. And just maybe optimistic—to think the world is the kind of place that will embrace you when you give your best. The habit of showing gratitude caused students to see more things to be grateful for, to have a more positive view of the world. They saw it as a place where people were likely to smile at them, help them, support them. Building a habit of seeing it made it appear everywhere. In the *Happiness Advantage*, Shawn Achor describes this as the Tetris Effect. You play enough Tetris and you see its characteristic shapes everywhere. Similarly, you see enough hard work behaviors from your peers, enough generosity and kindness, enough academic success, and it changes your view of the world. And this, too, is something we can use in the classroom, recognizing that where we direct our students' attention can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Narrating the good, the hard work, and the productivity around them helps them to see it when it is present and to learn more from observing it.

that students learn ideas and content that they come into contact with three different times—especially if each interaction is comprehensive and if the interactions present the information in slightly different ways. But, he notes, this only applies if students are paying attention, and Nuthall describes a series of experiences that will be familiar to all of us. A group of students are learning about Antarctica, for example, and are supposed to have learned that Antarctica is one of the driest places on earth. Some have and some haven't. Nuthall notices that a student named Teine is whispering to a peer and passing notes while a video is describing the desert nature of Antarctica. Teine fails to learn the content. Another student, Tui, often decides that he already knows the content being taught and so fails to listen carefully. He's not passing notes but he's not attending, and he, too, fails to learn.

This reveals an obvious but important fact about education: In any learning environment some people develop quickly and some people develop more slowly. One major factor in the rates at which individuals learn is their ability to concentrate for a significant period of time. Half-focused or fleetingly focused learners master things more slowly and with more difficulty. This is often apparent to us when we work with students with diagnosed attention issues, but of course the ability to sustain focus is spread unevenly across all students (and adults); its strength is a hidden driver of progress.

As I discuss at greater length in *technique 48*, *Habits of Attention*, “selective attention” is the term for the ability to focus on the task at hand and ignore distraction. It is the ability to select what you pay attention to—to lock out distractions and lock in on the signal—and has “reverberating effects” on success in language, literacy, and mathematics, note cognitive scientists Courtney Stevens and Daphne Bavelier.

potentially “large benefits to incorporating attention-training activities into the school context.”¹³

Not surprisingly, it turns out that building strong habits for focusing and maintaining attention—a key aspect of how educators help support students with attention deficits—is useful for all students. Still, attention may vary from moment to moment even for the same person. Learners may concentrate deeply in one setting and be scattered in another, and this variability reminds us that learning environments shape habits of attention. Attending to attention—building habits of sustaining focus—is one of the most important things that teachers can do. If there's a mental model of a productive classroom it surely includes students able to lose themselves in a task and work at it steadily for a significant period of time, which means a setting where concentration can reliably be maintained and tasks and activities where the ability to focus is carefully cultivated.

This has always been true—and has always been a challenge, perhaps—but probably never more so than today, when the capacity of technology to affect and erode attention is exponentially greater than ever before. Yes, educators in the 1960s argued that television eroded students' attention and focus, but young people at the time did not walk around with a television in their pocket. Television was not the medium through which all of young people's social interactions were funneled. Young people did not surreptitiously—or openly—check their TVs every few minutes during class. They were not habituated to need to check their televisions every few seconds. A young person—and an adult—today owns very few garments that do not have a pocket for a smartphone. The assumption—written in the language of fabric—is that our phones are and must always be within reach. Quietly, gradually, the dosage and accessibility of technology has increased to the

point where it has affected not only the level of attentiveness but the overall capacity for attentiveness of most people in profound ways. While a teacher's approach to attentiveness has always been a critical if unspoken part of a productive classroom, it is rapidly becoming more urgent. We aren't just struggling to help students learn to concentrate on what's important, we are struggling against a massive and pervasive technology that acts on our students—and ourselves—to erode that critical capacity in almost every minute of the day. Schools and teachers now must constantly design their choices and decisions with this challenge in mind if they hope to succeed. This is by far the single biggest change to emerge in education since the previous version of this book was published.

In his book *Deep Work*, Cal Newport examines the phenomenon of attention in the workplace, studying the conditions necessary to produce world-class knowledge work. Success in such a setting requires that you “hone your ability to master hard things,” he notes. A computer scientist by training, he uses writing code as an example. To be able to write complex, technical code is an outstanding thing to be good at, especially today, because knowledge work has never been more highly valued in society. Code moves freely and at light speed around the globe; if you write it well your audience of potential users is almost limitless. But this state of affairs—you in your happy place, writing code and sipping a latte while the world clamors for more and more of it—has a downside. Everyone else's code also moves freely and at light speed around the globe. Any line of it written anywhere in the world immediately competes with yours. All knowledge work is increasingly like this, Newport writes, and to succeed you not only must be able to concentrate to produce something uniquely intelligent, but “you must be able to do it quickly, again and again,” with “it” being the ability to achieve

mastery of new and difficult things. The key to mastering complex material with speed and flair, Newport writes, is the ability to sustain states of unbroken attention and deep concentration. Those who can focus best for longest separate themselves from the crowd.

However, Newport also observes that it has never been harder to build these focused mindsets because our daily lives (which include our work and learning environments) socialize distraction, lack of concentration, and states of constant half-attention. They erode rather than build the sorts of locked-in mental focus that ultimately drive so much of success. Concentration, he concludes, has never been better rewarded and never harder to achieve.14

A useful term in understanding why is *attention residue*.15 When you switch from one task to another, your mind remains partially focused on the previous task. You pause during a project to check your email and when you've returned to the project your mind is still partially on your email even if you don't realize it. You're now less likely to do your best work. This is especially corrosive, Newport points out, to learning new and difficult things, but researchers have found that people in most working environments operate in constant states of low-level distraction. It's common for students, too. The average undergraduate student, presumably more mature than K-12 students and an example of academic success and interest, still switches windows every nineteen seconds when working on his or her laptop, for example.

But beyond attention residue is a larger issue: Our brains are neuroplastic, which means they rewire according to how we use them. And the way we, and especially young people, use them increasingly involves constantly switching tasks. Every two and a half minutes is average for an adult; it is surely more for young people. The result is not just

aware of knowing about at the moment. If they missed some, if their conception contains misinformation, they won't know it without some way of checking themselves against a fuller description of the concepts they should know and which, to you, are implicit in the question. Ironically, someone with deep understanding of the causes of the Revolution is more likely to answer in the negative: “I still don't totally understand why the Intolerable Acts unified dissent rather than isolating colonial radicals ...”

Ask me, a novice, “Are you clear on the differences between plant and animal cells?” and really you are asking me, “Are you aware of some differences between plant and animal cells?” or “Are you aware that there are differences between plant and animal cells?” “Yes,” I will tell you, as I think of those things I do know which come readily to mind. They are shaped differently and plant cells have a cell wall that's relatively inflexible, I think. *Got it.* As I tell you this, though, I remain unaware that the nucleus is positioned differently within the cell, and I have no idea what lysosomes are. My honest answer is yes, but I don't know what I don't know. Sadly then, the less your students know about a topic, the more likely their *apparent assent* is to be inaccurate.

However, even this example presumes that I am trying very hard to share everything I know about plant and animal cells with you, my teacher. Just as often there are social and psychological barriers that prevent students from revealing their confusion. Let's say that I am aware that I didn't understand the difference between plant and animal cells. Saying “Actually, I don't know” means stopping the room—causing the teacher to go back and re-explain, when the presumption is clearly that she and my classmates do not want to. It means appearing to be, possibly, the only person in the room who didn't get it. Or the only person in the room who doesn't get that you’re not supposed to say

you don’t get it. All this for the uncertainty that the re-explanation will really help. It’s easier just to tell myself I’ll figure it out on my own. Such factors prevent most people, not just students, from speaking up when they are confused. When was the last time you stopped the room during a meeting to say, “Wait, I don’t get it”? If a colleague did this, what are the odds that you felt (or expressed) appreciation rather than exasperation? Students may occasionally say, “No, I don’t get it,” but not reliably so. There are too many implicit social pressures pushing them to keep their confusion to themselves.

A final factor that makes “Everybody get it?” questions ineffective is the format of the questions. They offer two bad choices. In most cases students’ understanding is somewhere in the middle; whether they get “it” is actually a series of questions in which the answer is yes to some and no to others. The answer to a yes/no “Do you get it?” question requires the conflation of a lot of data points; it causes students to choose one oversimplification or the other.

The good news is that when we ask questions like “Everybody get it?” we are recognizing that we are at a point when it would be beneficial to check for understanding. If we notice when we ask these sorts of questions, we can replace them with some more productive alternatives, what I call “targeted questions,” specific, objective questions focused on the content in question and asked in an open-ended format.

Imagine for a moment that our sixth-grade science teacher notices herself saying “Everybody get it?” during her introduction to plant and animal cell differences and tries to replace that question with something better. She might then say:

"OK, let's just check a few of the key ideas. If I was looking at a photograph of some cells and they were rounded and spaced randomly, would I be looking at plant or animal cells? Jasmine?"

"Good, and if I were looking at plant cells, what would cause them to have a more rectangular pattern? Louis?"

"Great. So which types of cells have a membrane, Kelsey, plant cells, animal cells, or both?"

"Good. Finally, Shawn, what are lysosomes and which kinds of cells would I find them in?"

1. First, you'll notice that our science teacher's questions are now objective. They don't ask whether students *think* they know, they ask them to *demonstrate* if they do, so the accuracy of the data is now far better.

2. Second, these are not yes/no questions. This makes it harder to guess the right answer or to get it right with only the most basic understanding.

One common solution to the problem of apparent assent is worth being wary of. Many teachers try to replace the yes/no question with a signal from students: *Thumbs up if you understand the differences between plant and animal cell structure, thumbs down if you don't, thumbs sideways if you're not sure.* This may seem like an improvement—you're likely to get more responses from students—but the problems of self-report remain—you're still relying on students' perception of whether they know something and the fact is, even if they're totally honest, many are probably still wrong on that account. Putting your thumb up or down may make the self-report more engaging and thus remove some of the awkward silence but in terms of giving you better data on your students' understanding, it's mostly an illusion. Targeted questions are far better.

Targeted questions work best when you plan them in advance, by the way. It's hard to think of the four questions that will quickly reveal where your students stand on the spur of the moment. And if you're trying to think of the next question you won't be able to listen to the answers very well. Or to think about your tone of voice. That's important because if you asked targeted questions in an environment where, say, you smiled warmly to show that getting it wrong would not make you frustrated, then you would make the opportunity to check for understanding more productive. Smiling when you ask your targeted question or perhaps when students struggle to answer reminds your class that you want honesty and that knowing about misconceptions early makes them easier to fix. This is a topic I will discuss further in *technique 12*, *Culture of Error*.

There's one other thing that will help you ensure that your students succeed: *Cold Calling* (see *technique 34*). This technique allows you to gather data from a sample of students from around the room. If you rely instead only on students who volunteer to answer, you will gather erroneous data. Students who volunteer to answer mostly do so when they think they know. Students who don't think they know are less likely to raise their hands. Unless you find a way to call on those pupils, you will always overestimate the proportion of your class that understands a concept.

*Cold Calling* also helps in another way. It helps you to move quickly through your questions. That might seem counterintuitive; wouldn't a teacher want to assess as thoroughly as possible? But one reason why teachers so routinely recognize the need to check for understanding but fail to act on it—or act on it in a cursory way—is time pressure. There's never enough time, as you know if you're a teacher, and taking five minutes to circle back to double-

check that everyone understands is stressful when you have ground to cover. If it takes forever and disrupts your pacing, or causes you to drop the last activity of your lesson plan, *of course* you won't do it. But if you could double-check in thirty seconds then you might really do it, so one of the keys to replacing self-report with targeted questions is to do it quickly—ideally in less than a minute. If (and only if) you can do it fast will you be likely to do it often. So even if it yields imperfect data, seek to gather what you can through the best questions you can design in a minute or less. You can use the remaining time to review if necessary.

Asking targeted questions can be just as valuable for assessing understanding of *tasks students are about to do* as it is for assessing understanding of *content you've just taught*. If you're sending students off for eight minutes of independent or partner work, it's really good to ask them a few targeted questions about the task so that you don't find out halfway through that they weren't really clear on how to write up their discussion notes or even that they had to write them. Generally speaking, the longer the task you are sending students off to do, the more important it is to assess their clarity on the task beforehand via targeted questions.

Recently I observed a lesson where a teacher wanted her students to read a text, note phrases and phrasings that were intentionally repetitive, and track shifts in who the implicit audience was. They were supposed to work solo for five minutes and then discuss with a partner.

Before she sent students off to do this task, she asked them targeted questions to review. It took her about twenty seconds and she used *Cold Call* to ensure that she wasn't just calling on the kids who thought they knew:

> **Teacher**: Nelson, tell me the two things I want you to look for while you're reading this.

**Teacher:** Good, and Tina, what should you do when you see examples of repetition?

**Tina:** Box them in the text.

**Teacher:** Yup. Nice. And Gary, is this partner work or independent work?

**Gary:** First by ourselves, then, after five minutes, work with a partner.

**Teacher:** Perfect. Off you go.

It would be so easy to have some portion of the class set off earnestly but do the wrong task! Ten minutes spent on a task for thirty students is *five hours of learning time* allocated with a single set of directions! Replacing “Everyone understand what we're doing?” with targeted questions is a smart investment.

It’s crucial to remember that the goal of targeted questions isn’t to be comprehensive but to create a small data sample where previously no data existed. It’s often better to be quick and bring data to multiple places in your lesson than to be comprehensive and exhaustive, but assess infrequently.

You might be wondering if this means you’re doing something wrong if you still occasionally ask students, “Got it?” or “Everybody clear on that?” Don’t worry. There’s no reason to be absolutist; you will almost assuredly say those phrases sometimes (I know I do); it’s almost impossible to root out familiar rhetorical habits and if you did, the self-consciousness it requires might be a distraction. It’s just important to recognize *how often* we use self-report and how much of an illusion it creates.

*find out how they are doing.* Hopefully in the aggregate that consciousness can be curative.

The video *Gabby Woolf: Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde* shows an interesting adaptation of *Replace Self-Report*. If you're not familiar with it, Robert Louis Stevenson's novella is a challenging read. For example, the passage Gabby was reading with her Year 10 class at London's King Solomon Academy begins: “Nearly a year later, in the month of October, 18—, London was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling.”

Gabby and her students read the passage aloud—you can hear them doing a lovely job reading it via FASE Reading in the clip *Gabby Woolf: Keystone*—and because of its complexity, Gabby paused after reading and told the class she wanted to “check that you understand.” She then projected a series of short targeted questions on the board and gave students a minute or so to review the answers in pairs. The questions were straightforward and designed to yield short answers that revealed student understanding (or the lack of it) quickly:

- “What month did the murder take place in?”
- “Why was London particularly startled by the victim?”
- “Who saw the murder?”
- “Where did she see the murder from?
- “Who is the murderer?”

Gabby wanted to ensure that despite archaic syntax such as “singular ferocity” and “rendered all the more notable” they had grasped the critical details of what had taken place.

You can see her reviewing these answers with her students in the video. Notice her warm tone and brisk pace. Her constant encouragement—“OK, good”—and the way her *Cold Call* keeps the pace moving allows her to sample a cross-section of students. She also slows the pace of her speech a bit to imply a slightly more reflective tone when she transitions: “Good, so we get the picture of what’s happened. Now go back to this question: How does Stevenson sensationalize the murder?”

Had Gabby asked this question without first checking for understanding, students might have engaged in the analysis confused about basic facts. But her questions, planned in advance for precision and speed, allow her to ensure that they are ready for a deeper discussion. The pair review prior to her questions also has the effect of allowing students to encode the answers more strongly in memory. And her tone is warm and her pace brisk, so she accomplishes the whole thing in about a minute.

# TECHNIQUE 7: RETRIEVAL PRACTICE

Forgetting is a constant problem in almost any setting that involves learning—so familiar and pervasive that we almost overlook it. Hours after demonstrating their understanding of juxtaposition in *Romeo and Juliet* or how to find the area of an irregular polygon, students may remember only a fraction of that knowledge. In a few days, they may have forgotten the majority of it. This simple if frequently overlooked fact is one of the most important considerations in teaching: Once students have initially learned something, they quickly begin to forget it.

You have probably seen this play out in your own classroom. On Tuesday you are confident in your students' skill and knowledge. They’re solid on the what, why, and how. But when you assess them a week and a half later, it’s

as if Tuesday's lesson never happened. Then, Rodrigo completed five complex area problems with ease; now you glance over his shoulder and see that he has gotten even simple problems wrong.

There is a silver lining, however, to this persistent challenge. The process of forgetting contains the seeds of its own solution. If you ask students to recall what they learned yesterday about the area of polygons or juxtaposition in *Romeo and Juliet* they will strain to remember but if successful, that struggle will more deeply encode the material in their long-term memories. They will remember a little more and forget a little less quickly.

*Retrieval Practice*, or the process of causing students to recall information they've learned after a strategic delay, is a practical solution to the problem of forgetting. If you graphed the process of retrieval practice it might look something like this, with each repetition along the top axis an iteration of retrieval practice and the percentages on the y-axis representing how much of a given body of content students remember.

This illustration is an example of what's called a forgetting curve.¹ It represents the nature of forgetting as educational psychologists understand it. At point 1, the end of your lesson, students have acquired a certain amount of knowledge and skills. But as soon as the bell rings, the forgetting begins. And forgetting is a relentless enemy. Even a few minutes later some of the details will have gotten hazy. By the next day students will have forgotten even more—possibly more than half of what they learned. If steps aren't taken to arrest this process, they may lose most of what they know. On the curve, the process of unchecked forgetting is represented by line A.

into working memory. Having done so, their knowledge of it returns roughly to the level it was at by the end of the original lesson.

Of course, after this review, forgetting begins again. What students know again starts to slip away. The second downward sloping line (B) captures this. But the rate of forgetting is slower now and the line starts to flatten sooner—which suggests that more remains in long-term memory. If you review again, knowledge is refreshed and forgetting again resumes immediately after—represented by line C—but again the rate is slower yet and the floor (total amount of knowledge retained) is higher still.

As the cognitive psychologists Paul Kirschner, John Sweller, and Richard Clark write: “The aim of all instruction is to alter long-term memory. If nothing has changed in long-term memory, nothing has been learned.”2 If we spent an hour studying the systems of the human body only to have students forget it—a day later, a week later, a month later—then the lesson might have been interesting and engaging, but students would have learned precious little. Even the deepest and most profound discussions remain at risk of evaporating as if into ether. As Harry Fletcher Wood puts it, “Student performance while being taught is a poor indicator of lasting learning.” We should by all means check for understanding at the end of a lesson. But just because students appear to know something at the end of that hour does not mean they will know it in a week, a month, or a year. If we want lasting learning, we have to get things into long-term memory, and retrieval practice is the best way to do that.

Since the concept of *Retrieval Practice* is discussed throughout cognitive psychology in a wide variety of contexts, the following is a useful “teacher's definition.”

# Retrieval Practice

Retrieval Practice occurs when learners recall and apply multiple examples of previously learned knowledge or skills after a period of forgetting. This definition suggests two key things.

## First: Intentionality

You might say, “Oh, asking kids about concepts we previously learned? I do that all the time,” but what we're talking about here is more than just occasional episodic review—“Remember how we talked about juxtaposition when we read *Romeo and Juliet*?” It's the strategic use of retrieval, systematically and regularly. This might even mean *Retrieval Practice* becomes a discrete part of your lessons—a chunk of time you design with the explicit purpose of causing students to recall important things in strategic ways, probably using tools like *Cold Call* and *Call and Response* to ensure that every student recalls the requisite information. Retrieval in these settings need not be simplistic or rote. A bit of challenge is beneficial, so changing formats or asking students to apply concepts in new ways is likely to help.

## Second: Strategic Delay

Notice on the Forgetting Curve that the delay between rounds of retrieval increases slightly each time. Gradually increasing the intervals between rounds of retrieval aids memory because the best time to remember something is when you have begun to forget it, and the rate of our forgetting is constantly changing. And if nothing else, a glance at the Forgetting Curve should confirm that it is almost impossible to master a concept in a durable and enduring way in a single lesson.³

You might be tempted to think of *Retrieval Practice* as a recipe for mere rote memorization, but this is not the case. Retrieval is an opportunity for what Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel call “elaboration”: connecting an idea to other ideas, reflecting on it, and expanding it as you review it. Elaboration aids in retrieval, in fact.⁴ When a concept is connected to other related ideas and when students can

describe it in different ways, it becomes more powerful. So you might, in reviewing juxtaposition, deliberately ask for elaboration. “Asha, what's juxtaposition? Darius, what's an example from *Romeo and Juliet*? Katie, what's another? Roberto, what's another example of two characters who are juxtaposed from something else we've read? Good, and Kyra, in your own words, why might an author use juxtaposition?” The elaboration, causing students to explain and put into new words, to make connections, increases their knowledge of the concept and the likelihood that they will remember it when they need it.

The first half of the video *Christine Torres: Keystone* is a great example of other ways that *Retrieval Practice* can work. Christine is reviewing vocabulary words with students. Notice the richness of the questions Christine asks. *Retrieval Practice* questions don't have to be simple recall. Christine asks her students to apply the vocabulary words they're learning in different ways and new settings. That's important, because words work differently in different settings. To truly understand a word, you'd want students to constantly encounter it in all its nuanced shades of meaning. Christine asks students to know the definition, but also to apply the word in challenging and interesting ways. It's both simple and more elaborated retrieval. Christine makes sure that every student wrestles with almost every question. She uses *Turn and Talk* (see technique 43). For retrieval practice, we can't just take hands from volunteers or let a few highly verbal kids call out answers. We need to cause everyone to remember and apply the concept.

Interestingly, the period of delay between initial learning and retrieval is short in Christine's classroom. Forgetting, she knows, starts right away. With challenging and potentially confusing concepts, especially, it's not too soon to begin retrieving right away. So even though students

learned what the words meant just a few minutes ago, Christine is already trying to get them into long-term memory. And Christine will be sure to follow up the next day and/or a few days later—and again a few days after that—with more fun and engaging questions to retrieve and apply their knowledge of their vocabulary words. She also frequently includes previously mastered vocabulary words when she's retrieving new words. In this way they will have both depth and richness of understanding and long-term memory of the words.

It's not just that *more* of the original material remains in long-term memory that matters with *Retrieval Practice*. It's that the knowledge that is there is *easier for students to recall*. After three rounds of review, the neural pathways back to those discussions about juxtaposition in *Romeo and Juliet*, for example, are well worn. When students come upon an example of juxtaposition in some other text they are reading, the examples from Shakespeare will snap readily to mind. They will form connections. Easier retrieval leads to more than just knowing facts, in other words. Having various models of juxtaposition that come easily and naturally to mind becomes a schema—a connected body of knowledge that becomes familiar enough that people can use it quickly and easily to process information at minimal load to working memory as they interact with the world around them. Knowledge in that form—encoded in long-term memory and easily accessed—helps students perceive and understand more. This is one key reason why educational psychologists like Daniel Willingham remind us that knowledge easily accessed in long-term memory is the key to higher-order thinking.5 The best way to maximize the capacity of working memory for higher-order thinking, as I discussed in **Chapter One**, is to give it access to lots of ideas in long-term memory that it can draw upon.6

You can see some unexpected benefits of retrieval practice in the video Lauren Moyle: *Cranium*. Lauren here is asking her first-grade students to retrieve into active memory key details about the body. The brain is an *essential* organ that controls our decision making. It is encased in a bone called the cranium. The heart is a *pump* that distributes blood to the body like an engine. You can see them recalling the pieces of this content in different ways: What's it called, Why is it called that, What does it do? Every child is engaged with the task.

Interestingly this video is about ten years old and only recently did I come to understand it! We used to show it at workshops, inspired by Lauren's dynamic teaching—the questioning that fostered eager hands supported by the use of *Cold Call* and with *No Opt Out*, to ensure accountability and engagement. We were focused on *how* Lauren taught and didn't spend much time thinking about the value of *what* she was doing. In fact, ironically, when *what* she was teaching came up in discussions at workshops, I often found myself apologizing for it. Participants would occasionally note that she was *just recalling facts*, the phrase implying there wasn't much substantive teaching going on. Eventually we stopped showing the video altogether.

Now I can see much more clearly that *what* Lauren is doing is at least as valuable as *how* she's doing it. Future discussions in her class will be richer and based on firm knowledge because of *what* she does here. The other unexpected thing the video shows is how much students tend to like *Retrieval Practice*. Lauren's students are eager, happy, and confident. Teachers sometimes presume that facts are boring for students and so focusing on retrieval practice will make their classes dull, but the opposite is often the case. Students who know their material are proud to know it and eager to use it. And as they begin they see

examples of what they know in more and more places, their confidence grows, often transferring to more complicated tasks in which they are asked to put those facts to use.

I'll close the discussion of *Retrieval Practice* by sharing a video, *Retrieval Practice Montage*, of several teachers employing the concept in different ways. Art Worrell's AP U.S. History students stand to answer his retrieval questions. It's a regular and intentional part of the day and the importance of *Retrieval Practice* is transparent to students. This helps them to understand how important it is for them to use in their own studying! Art again undercuts the idea that *Retrieval Practice* questions have to be simple. He asks Tarik what the compromise of 1877 was, but also why it was important. He then asks Kamari to expand on Tarik's answer. As Kamari's answer shows, it's broad knowledge, not just narrow facts, that they're recalling.

Annette Riffle uses *Retrieval Practice* in her middle school math classroom to make ideal use of what might otherwise be down time—one student is at the board modeling a problem and, rather than allowing everyone else to sit passively, she peppers them with key questions about coordinate geometry.

Barry Smith's use of *Retrieval Practice* in his French class shows two things: first, a variety of ways to engage—*Cold Call*, *Call and Response*, hands raised—and also that the content goes in two directions. Barry asks his students to go both from French to English and English to French. Teachers of other content areas might think about naming a concept and asking students to describe it and then flipping the process: describing a concept and asking students to name it, asking, for example, “What is hyperbole?”; “What is it called when authors intentionally exaggerate to make a point?”; and perhaps even “If I say

I've got a million things to do today, what literary device am I using?" All of these strengthen the neural pathway.

Finally, Alonte Johnson reminds us in his literature classroom that we can ask students to retrieve a full range of content types: plot, character, background knowledge, and even themes.

# TECHNIQUE 8: STANDARDIZE THE FORMAT

Though asking questions of students is a great tool to check for understanding, gathering data through observation is arguably even more effective when you can use it. One major benefit of relying on observation to assess student understanding is that it allows you to respond quickly to more complex ideas in more formats than you can assess through questioning alone. Another benefit is that you can “parallel-process”—you can be checking for understanding while students are working. For example, you can quickly observe the quality of your students' thesis paragraphs as they are writing them.

But the greatest advantage of gathering data through observation is its efficiency. Done well it allows you to gather data quickly and about everyone. This is important because gathering data in the midst of instruction is almost always subject to significant time constraints. Say you assign independent work to students for five minutes. By the time you've given students a chance to get started, have answered their questions, and checked to make sure everyone has gotten underway, you might have three minutes to assess thirty students—six seconds per student on average. Many teachers might successfully assess ten students in that amount of time but if you can gather information twice as fast with half as many distractions,

you suddenly become able to assess and respond to students in situations where you weren't previously able to. Suddenly six minutes is enough. In some cases two or three minutes can be profoundly useful. If you maximize the efficiency of data gathering, you also increase the times and places when you can use it without redesigning your lessons. You become able to assess what happens during parts of your lesson that might otherwise go unmonitored. So while efficiency might seem at first like one of the least compelling words in teaching, it turns out to be critical to many of the most important things that differentiate great lessons from others.

*Standardize the Format* focuses on streamlining data-gathering and making your observation more efficient and accurate. It means designing materials and space so that you're looking predictably—in the same, consistent place every time—for the data you need. You might ask for work to be shown in the margin of a specific page of your students' books, for example, or for students to circle their final answer to a problem set. Or, at the beginning of class, you might give students a “packet” (see *technique 4*, *Double Plan*) in which to do key aspects of their work that day, and include clearly visible, preset places to write or take notes.

The following details from lesson packets in the Reading Reconsidered Curriculum my team and I developed offer some examples of ways carefully designed materials can organize the space where students work to make observation and assessment easier.

without being too structured or leading (or asking for more writing than is needed). It also models for students how to take organized notes.

In addition to enabling you to find answers (or key steps in the work process) more quickly, *Standardize the Format* allows you to disrupt students less. You won’t spend time flipping through their work or asking them to help you find answers and this will allow them to concentrate. Most important, though, instead of expending energy (and using your own working memory) locating answers, you can identify and assess trends among your students’ work and spot examples to share with the class. Simplifying search tasks reduces extraneous cognitive load; the more consistent the appearance and placement of the data, the more you will be able to focus on what it’s telling you. You perceive more accurately, remember more of what you see, and think more productively about it.

There are some surprising relational benefits to all this *“efficiency”* and *“productivity”* and you can see an example of them in the video *Nicole Warren: Keystone*. As she circulates and observes during the last few minutes of the clip you may notice the beautiful connections she makes with students. There are sincere encouragements and acknowledgments. These little moments of relationship building are surely something most of us seek, so it’s important to observe that they stem in part from the ease with which she can find what she is looking for in each student’s work. The easiness leaves her relaxed and confident. With her working memory only lightly taxed by search costs, her mind is free to think about each student in turn as she works the room, and all her warmth and graciousness can show.

*Format* even further. In addition to directing students to answer in the same space, you can also ask them to lift up the key pieces of the answer that you are looking for as you circulate. “Box the equation you used to calculate the sum,” or “Underline the appositive you added to your thesis.” These additional directions not only make it easier for you to focus on the most important aspect of student work when time is of the essence, but also heighten student awareness of the most important variable to include in their work. Boxing the remainder or circling the active verbs in their topic sentence helps students to focus and prioritize.

My team and I recently tried to use *Standardize the Format* ourselves at a workshop on CFU. The topic was “Reject Self-Report” and the activity was a series of case studies: six transcripts from classroom situations where a teacher had initially relied on student self-report to assess mastery. Teachers in the workshop were asked to rewrite cases, scripting their questions to better gather data about student mastery in lieu of self-report. Workshop participants were asked to complete several of the scenarios over the course of a few minutes. At the bottom was an additional section where people were asked to identify and rewrite a case from their own experience. The page we provided looked like *Figure 3.1*.

which topics people had found interesting and would want to discuss during the post-activity discussion. It also helped us write scenarios for future workshops. If very few people choose example 5, for example, we could replace it.

*What good ideas and common misunderstandings we could talk about during the debrief.* It was easy for me to look for more evidence of something specific; for example, if I saw something intriguing in one participant's answer to example 3 and wanted to know if it was typical, it was ten times easier for me to track other people's responses to that example.

It was also easy to scan to the final question and differentiate those answers. That is, I wanted to look differently at the scenario of their own experience to get a quick sense of the sorts of settings they were finding applicable. This was easy to do because the answer I wanted to analyze more closely was located in the same place on every participant's paper. I could find it and tell it apart in an instant.

People worked for three or four minutes, and the room had about 120 people in it. But at the end of that time, I had a pretty good sense of what the strengths and gaps in understanding were, and it was mostly thanks to an apparently mundane design decision. Merely using *Standardize the Format* in a very simple way greatly leveraged my ability to understand what was happening in the room.

*Culture of Error*, but I would argue that the latter term goes farther: it includes both psychological safety—feelings of mutual trust and respect and comfort in taking intellectual risks—and appreciation, perhaps even enjoyment, for the insight that studying mistakes can reveal. In a classroom with a *Culture of Error*, students feel safe if they make a mistake, there is a notable lack of defensiveness, and they find the study of what went wrong interesting and valuable.

You can see this happening in the video *Denarius Frazier: Remainder. Gathering data through Active Observation* (*technique 9*), he spots a consistent error. As students seek to divide polynomials they struggle to find the remainder. Fagan is one of many students who have made the mistake. Denarius takes her paper and projects it to the class so they can study it. His treatment of this moment is critical. There is immense value in studying mistakes like this if teachers can make it feel psychologically safe. Unfortunately, it doesn't take a lot of imagination to picture the moment going wrong—badly wrong. The student could feel hurt, offended, or chastened. Her classmates could snicker. Perhaps you are imagining the phone call that evening: *Let me see if I have this right, Mr. Frazier. You projected my daughter's mistakes on the overhead for everyone to see?*

But in Denarius's hands, the moment proceeds beautifully and, more importantly, as if it were the most normal thing in the world to acknowledge a mistake and study it. How does he do it?

First, notice his tone. Denarius is emotionally constant. He is calm and steady. There's no suggestion of blame. He sounds no different whether he is talking about success or struggle. Next, he uses group-oriented language to make it clear that the issue they'll study is common among the

class. “On a few of *our* papers, I'm noticing that *we're* getting an incorrect remainder ...” he says. The mistake is ours; it's relevant to and reflective of the group, not just the individual. There's no feeling that Fagan has been singled out.

Another important characteristic of classrooms like Denarius’s has to do with how error itself is dealt with. It is best captured in a phrase math teacher Bob Zimmerli uses in the video *Culture of Error Montage*: “I'm so glad I saw that mistake,” he tells his students. “It's going to help me to help you.” His phrase suggests that the error is a good thing. He calls the class to attention to show it is a worthy and serious topic, but he simultaneously normalizes the error through tone and word choice.

This is different from—the opposite of in many ways—pretending it is not really an error. Notice that Bob explicitly identifies the mistake as a mistake. His goal is to make it feel normal and natural, not to minimize the degree to which students felt they had erred. I mention this because sometimes teachers struggle with this distinction. In workshops we occasionally ask teachers to write phrases that they could use to express to students the idea that it is normal and useful to be wrong. They sometimes suggest responses like “Well, that's one way you could do it,” or “Let's talk about some other ways,” or “OK, maybe. Good thinking!”

These phrases blur the line between correct and incorrect or avoid telling students they are wrong. There are, of course, times when it's useful to say, “Well, there's no right answer, but let's consider other options.” But that is a very different moment from the one in which a teacher should say something like “I can see why you'd think that but you're wrong, and the reasons why are really interesting,”

or “A lot of people make that mistake because it seems so logical, but let's take look at why it's wrong.”

You can see another example of this in the *Culture of Error Montage*. Mathew Gray, like Denarius, is sharing a mistake —this one made by a student named Elias (a Show Call, technique 13). He notes this right away: “Elias has made a mistake,” but he notes that this is not a surprise because he made the question difficult and that others have made the mistake as well. Then crucially he adds, “It's a mistake that I made when I first read the poem.” He is the teacher and he, too, has struggled to understand. What could more fully contradict the idea that being an expert somehow means that one does not make mistakes? The idea is not to forestall defensiveness by making students believe they are correct, in other words, but to forestall defensiveness by helping students to see that the experience of making a mistake is normal and valuable.

Here are some other phrases that do that:

- “I'm glad I saw that mistake. It teaches us something we have to fix before we've mastered this.”
- “I like that your first instinct was to use geometry, but in this situation, we have to solve algebraically.”
- “Yes, the writing here makes it very challenging to follow who is saying what. But that phrase is spoken by Mary and not by John. Let's take a look at how we know that.”
- “What I am asking you to do is difficult. Even working scientists struggle with it. But I know we'll get it, so let's take a look at what went wrong here... .”

It's worth noting that the statements are different. The first flips student expectation; the teacher is glad to have seen the mistake. The second gives credit to the student's

understanding of the mathematical principles—but makes it clear that she's come up with the right answer for a different setting. The third and fourth acknowledge that the task is not the sort of thing you try just once and get right. They normalize struggle.

As this *Culture of Error* is created, students become more likely to *want* to expose their mistakes. This shift from defensiveness or denial to openness is critical. As a teacher you can now spend less time and energy hunting for mistakes and more time learning from them. Similarly, if the goal is for students to learn to self-correct—to find and address errors on their own—becoming comfortable acknowledging mistakes is a critical step forward.

## Building a Culture of Error

A teacher alone cannot establish a culture in which it is safe to struggle and fail. If snickers greet a classmate who gets an answer wrong, for example, or if impatient hands wave in the air while another student is trying to answer, very little that a teacher does will result in students feeling safe exposing their mistakes to the group.

Shaping how students respond to one another's struggles is, therefore, a must. It is a process that starts with teaching students the right way to handle common situations. That is, explain how you expect them to act when someone struggles *before it happens*, share the rationale, practice the expected behaviors in hypothetical situations, and if (when) a breach occurs, reset the culture firmly, but with understanding.

understanding of the mathematical principles—but makes it clear that she's come up with the right answer for a different setting. The third and fourth acknowledge that the task is not the sort of thing you try just once and get right. They normalize struggle.

As this *Culture of Error* is created, students become more likely to *want* to expose their mistakes. This shift from defensiveness or denial to openness is critical. As a teacher you can now spend less time and energy hunting for mistakes and more time learning from them. Similarly, if the goal is for students to learn to self-correct—to find and address errors on their own—becoming comfortable acknowledging mistakes is a critical step forward.

## Building a Culture of Error

A teacher alone cannot establish a culture in which it is safe to struggle and fail. If snickers greet a classmate who gets an answer wrong, for example, or if impatient hands wave in the air while another student is trying to answer, very little that a teacher does will result in students feeling safe exposing their mistakes to the group.

you. Among other things, we know that person could just as well be us.”

When you think about making it safe to struggle, it's important to consider that the goal is not just eliminating potentially negative behaviors among students. Even better would be fostering a culture where students actively support one another as they struggle through the learning process. Collegiate Academies in New Orleans does a great job of encouraging this culture. When someone is struggling to answer a question, peers (or teachers) “send magic,” making a subtle hand gesture that means, “I’m supporting you.” After an answer, if peers wish to show appreciation (they often do), they show it with snapping fingers, thus creating a system for positive student-to-student feedback for quality work.11 This positive culture is one of the most remarkable and powerful things about a remarkable group of schools.

And of course having strong *Habits of Attention* ([technique 48](#)) is critical to ensure that signals of belonging are strong and the importance of each student's ideas is regularly reinforced.

That said, building a classroom culture that respects, normalizes, and values error is complex work, so I've named and described some of the key culture building moves in greater detail so they're easier to use intentionally in your classroom.

# Expect Error

After a mistake occurs, strive to show that you are glad to know about it. We want the overall message to be that errors are a normal part of learning—a positive part, often—and are most useful when they are out in the open.

Consider how Roxbury Prep math teacher Jason Armstrong communicated the normalcy of error even before he started reviewing answers to a problem recently. “I suspect there's going to be some disagreement here, so I might hear a couple different people's answers,” he said, before taking *four* different answers from the class. His words implied that the normal state of affairs is to see different answers among smart people doing challenging work. This also serves to teach that math is not just a matter of deciding between a right answer and a wrong one but, sometimes, a matter of deciding among a wide array of plausible answers. If the questions are hard, Jason's teaching intimated, of course people will disagree.

## Withhold the Answer

In the video *Culture of Error Montage* you can see Jason introduce a second problem from the same lesson. His choice of language was again striking:

> OK, now for the four answers we have here, A, B, C, and D, I don't want to start by asking which one you think is right, because I want to focus on the explanations that we have. So let me hear what people think of D. I don't care if you think it's right or wrong; I just want to hear what people think. Eddie, what did you say about it?

You've probably noticed that Jason's language emphasizes the importance of mathematical thinking (as opposed to just getting it right). That's valuable. In situations when many teachers say things like, “I want to focus on the explanation. How you think about this is as important as whether you got it right,” what Jason does is different because *students don't know whether or not they are discussing a right answer*. He has asked them not to

discuss how they got the answer *they* gave—and therefore think is right—but an answer that he chose.

We often begin reviewing a problem by revealing the right answer and then, suspense alleviated, talking about it. However, as soon as students know the right answer, the nature of their engagement tends to change. They shift to thinking about whether they got it right and how well they did. No matter how much they love the math for the math's sake (or history or science or literature for its sake), part of them is thinking “Yes! I got it,” or “Darn, I knew that,” or “Darn, why do I keep messing up?” If Jason had said, “The answer here is B, but I want to look at D,” some students would almost assuredly have thought, “Cool, I knew that,” *and then stopped listening as closely because in their minds they had gotten it right and didn't need to listen.*

One of the simplest and easiest things you can do to begin building a *Culture of Error* is to delay revealing whether an answer is right or wrong until after you've discussed it, and perhaps an alternative.

You can see Katie Bellucci do this in the video *Katie Bellucci: Different Answers*. She begins by asking students to use hand signals (see *technique 10*, *Show Me*) to reveal their answers to a multiple-choice question. “We have some different answers out here,” she says, “I see some twos, threes, and fours. B, C, and D.” Her tone is cheery, indicating that disagreement—and therefore wrong answers—is not a bad thing. It only proves the discussion will be interesting. But notice what she does next. As she begins reworking the problem with the help of her students, she does not tell them which of those answer choices was correct.

By *withholding the answer* until after she's discussed the question fully, Katie retains a bit of suspense, keeps students productively engaged, and avoids the distraction

of “Did I get it right?” for a few seconds. This can be very productive, not just as an intellectual exercise, but as a cultural one, in causing students to spend less energy evaluating their work and more energy thinking about the underlying ideas (“I hadn’t thought of doing it that way. I wonder if she’ll get the answer I got”).

Her lovely move to normalize and celebrate error—“Put your hand up if you changed your answer. Yes, be proud! You figured it out,” is a perfect way to express the core of the idea in *Culture of Error*—*the fun is in the process*. She celebrates struggle in the most compelling way, but that moment is really only possible if everyone is invested in “figuring it out” with her throughout the process, and it all starts with her decision to withhold the answer.

# Manage the Tell

In poker circles, players have to watch their “tell”—the unintentional signals they give that reveal the status of their hand to savvy opponents. A good player can figure out that an opponent's habit of rubbing his eyes or rechecking his cards is a nervous tic revealing a poor hand. Having a tell puts you at such a disadvantage that some elite players wear sunglasses and hooded sweatshirts to ensure they don't reveal too much.

As teachers, we also have tells—unintentional cues that reveal our hand, such as whether an answer was right or wrong or whether we valued what a student said. A tell causes us to communicate more than we realize. It compromises our ability to withhold the answer. And it can often result in our unwittingly communicating disdain for errors.

One of my tells as a teacher was the word “Interesting,” offered in a benign but slightly patronizing tone of voice and usually with a “Hmmm” in front of it and a single, long

blink of both eyes. I would use it, without realizing it, in my English classes when a student offered an interpretation I thought was flimsy. I know this was my tell because one day after a student comment, I said, “Hmmm. Interesting.” At that point, a student named Danielle said quite clearly from the back of the classroom, “Uh oh. Try again!” She knew what “interesting” meant: “Well, that was disappointing.” Like most teachers, I was saying a lot more than I thought I was. My message really was, “You probably should have kept that thought to yourself,” and the student who'd spoken and all my students knew that. So much for making it safe to be wrong.

Compare that to Emily Badillo's response to student errors in the video *Emily Badillo: Culture of Error*. Her facial expression does not change whether students are right or wrong. She's the same steady, emotionally constant self. It helps that she withholds the answer. There's no giveaway at all.

We all have tells—several, probably—and because they are unintentional, we may send them over and over, communicating a message to students that undercuts what we might intend to say. One of my most capable colleagues describes a different tell. When students gave an answer in her class, she would write it on the board if it were correct, but wouldn't bother to write it if it were wrong. Sometimes she would call on a student and turn to the board, marker poised as if to write, only to turn back to the class upon hearing the answer, and recap the marker: **Click**. Message received.

Students figure out our tells surprisingly quickly, so it's important to seek them out in our own teaching and manage them. Of course, we'll never be perfect. Of course, it's fine to say, “Interesting” or even to explicitly say, “I think we can do better” or “No, I'm sorry, that's not

correct.” You just want to be aware of and intentional about what you communicate and when. Think for a moment about what might be the most common teacher tell: “Does anyone have a *different* answer?” (When was the last time you said *that* when someone got it right?) In using this phrase without intentionality, you would first communicate that the answer was wrong and therefore risk discouraging students from thinking as deeply about it as they would if they didn't know. Second, you would imply to the student who answered, “If that's all you've got, please don't speak again.”

It's worth noting that the most persistent tells are usually in response to wrong answers, but we can also have tells for right answers—a big, bright face or perhaps the inflection on the word “*why*” in a statement like, “And can you tell us *why* you think Wilbur is afraid?” Clearly, it's not a negative to show appreciation and enthusiasm for a great answer. But it *is* worth considering whether that enthusiasm sometimes gives away too much, too soon or, if it's used too often, what its absence communicates. Ideally, we are all alert to our tells and manage them—replacing them as often as possible with a consistent and balanced expression of appreciation that's not quite approval.

# Praise Risk-Taking

The final aspect of creating a *Culture of Error* is to praise students for taking risks and facing down the challenge of a difficult subject. It's especially useful to encourage students to take risks when they're not sure. A statement such as, “This is a tough question. If you're struggling with it, that's a good sign. Now, who'll be bold and start us off?” reminds students that being a scholar means offering your thoughts when you're not sure, and sometimes *because* you're not sure. You can reinforce that positively by saying, for example, “I love the fact that this is a hard question and so

many of you have your hands in the air,” or you can shorthand that by simply referring to your students' “brave hands” when you see them raised (for example, “Who wants to take a shot at our challenge question? Beautiful. Love those brave hands … Diallo, what do you think?”). If discussing a particularly difficult passage in a book, you could try acknowledging the difficulty by saying something like, “This is a question that people have debated for decades, but you're really attacking this.” You can see Denarius Frazier do this in the *Culture of Error* montage. “Ohhh, I like this bravery,” he says, looking out at a handful of students willing to try to answer a difficult question. In a *Culture of Error*, students should feel good about stepping out on a limb, whether they're right or wrong.

# Putting It All Together: Jasmine Howard, Nicole Warren, and the Back (or Front) Table

The video *Jasmine Howard: College Bound* provides a beautiful example of *Standardize the Format*, *Active Observation*, *Show Me*, and *Culture of Error* in a single clip, shot in her eighth-grade math class at Freedom Prep in Memphis, Tennessee. She's chosen one problem within a larger problem set as a sort of gatekeeper. It's a sort of mid-class Exit Ticket. Jasmine circulates and observes. She's using a version of *Active Observation* that's more focused on preparing to give group feedback than on giving individual feedback to every student. Based on these observations, she reviews the problem with the whole class and, as she does so, uses *Show Me* to check that students arrived at answer A. She then sends students to independent practice but walks around and signals subtly to four students to meet her at the back table. There, Jasmine teaches a targeted mini-lesson for the students who needed more help, observing and supporting them as they work. Here you can see her *Standardizing the Format* as she asks students to circle the rate of change to ensure that they both calculated it correctly and know what it is. She does this with impeccable *Culture of Error*—steady, supportive, nonjudgmental. You can see how much the students feel this as they get up from their desks to come to the back table. The first student she taps starts to gather his things and move right away. He's not embarrassed and he's not trying to hide. He trusts in Jasmine to help him and you can see why when you watch her reteach. Jasmine has caught a simple misunderstanding early, before it snowballed, and adeptly has given them just the support they need to

understand the concept. It's one of the most impressive takes on differentiation through *Check for Understanding* I've had the pleasure of watching.

Not only that, but Jasmine's forming a group for reteaching in “real-time” *Checking for Understanding* reminded me of another clip of Nicole Warren doing something similar. You can see this in the clip *Nicole Warren: Front Table* in her third-grade classroom at Leadership Prep Ocean Hill. Nicole calls students up to the front table for extra practice after the previous day's *Exit Ticket* revealed that they continued to struggle with story problems.

In part, she told me, she wanted to pull them up front to watch them solve the problem “so I could stop them in the moment, if necessary, and be sure they were using the strategy we had discussed the day before. Since we already spent time debriefing this problem, I wanted to be sure they were practicing correctly to solidify the skill.”

In other words, Nicole observes all students carefully, but she also structured her classroom so she can occasionally observe students she's worried about even more carefully. Everyone gets real-time feedback; but this allows her to give a double dose to those who need it most. And you'll notice that they get a ton of feedback —positive in tone but rigorous—and they get the implicit feedback of knowing—when they are sent back to their seats—that they've mastered, at least for the moment, the skill that Nicole had targeted.

One of the most important things Nicole does to make her front table system work is to think about how to leverage her *Culture of Error*—there has to be no judgment, no stigma, no snickering about working at the front table. Nicole's messaging sets that up.

“Pulling a small group has never had a stigma. I think it has to do with how we frame it. We tell students, ‘This is a moment to get extra practice one-on-one or in a small group with your teacher.’ We never make this time feel negative in any way and students leave feeling successful, after getting the problem correct. We use stickers, high-fives, and smiles to commend them for showing effort through a tricky problem. In addition, the students who come up to the table are always different, based on the [most current] data. Sometimes it is students who are on the higher end, too. This helps to normalize the idea that everyone struggles and that this struggle is a part of the process that leads to mastery.”

By the way, a couple of other favorite *Teach Like a Champion* moments from this Nicole Willey clip: Nicole uses *Brighten the Lines* (*technique 28*), when she uses the prompt “Go!” after her directions to help ensure that students jump right into their work. She also uses *What to Do* (*technique 52*) beautifully to make sure one of her front-table scholars is listening to her feedback. The student looks like he wants to start going before he really hears what she’s saying, so she says, “Look at me” (twice!), in a warm, supportive tone backed by a smile.

Like Jasmine, Nicole has designed her classroom around the idea of *Checking for Understanding*.

# TECHNIQUE 13: SHOW CALL

Let’s return to what is perhaps the crucial moment in the clip from Denarius Frazier’s math class that we’ve been examining in the course of this chapter, *Denarius Frazier: Remainder*. Circulating and observing actively, Denarius recognizes that there’s something his students have

misunderstood about finding the remainder when dividing polynomials. He has recognized an error in real time but this is only half of the equation in *Checking for Understanding*. The second half, deciding how to address it, is a much more challenging question than it appears. Teachers bury the data—recognize student misunderstandings and fail to take action on them—all the time. In many cases this is because of the difficulty of changing one's lesson plan on the spur of the moment in front of thirty students. Or a failure to address the error may be due to the pressure of time. But Denarius hardly bats an eye. He chooses the work of a student, Fagan, who made a characteristic error, walks to the front of the room and projects it to the class. Seconds later the class is engaging with interest and openness in a study of the mistake, why it happened, and what it could teach them.

What's the quickest and most productive way to respond to an error in the midst of teaching, in other words? Often it's to study the error itself.

If you can pull that off, you have a simple, reliable tool to use in response to student errors. If students struggle to understand the first time, you may not have to plan a backup lesson or a new way of teaching the material if you can instead make a useful version of the error instantly visible and then build a culture that supports open study of the thinking that led to a mistake.

That's a powerful idea. If we can find and study our mistakes with openness and fascination, if we can discuss them in substantive conversations, then we have a replicable way to react to error when we see it and we are teaching a process we'd wish our students to copy for much of their lives: Find the mistake. Study it without defensiveness. Relish it as a learning opportunity.

The technique Denarius uses to accomplish this is *Show Call*, choosing a student's work and sharing it, visually, with the class so they are not just talking about it but studying it in a durable sustained way. An essential component of making this sustained study possible is the fact that the mistake is visible to all students. If Denarius had not projected Fagan's work to the class, the class would have learned far less from it.

This opportunity for learning is too important for Denarius to accept anything but the most productive example. Using *Show Call* effectively implies being able to choose deliberately whose work to project. A *Show Call* is therefore not just projecting work but selecting the example regardless of who's volunteered to share. *Show Call* is a visual Cold Call. To learn optimally from an example, students must see it well, and they need to be looking at just the right case study.

You will also probably notice that Fagan, the accomplished young woman whose work he's chosen, is not bothered when Denarius takes her paper. She doesn't look surprised, as you might expect her to have been. It's a familiar procedure, in other words, one that happens, if not daily, then regularly, and one that began with Denarius explaining to the class what he would do and why before he did it the first time. Then they practiced it—tried the idea out under controlled circumstances where success was more assured. For example, the first few times he used *Show Call*, Denarius probably focused on making *Show-Called* students feel honored by and comfortable with the process. Over time his *Show Calls* became more rigorous. Now he doesn't need to explain why he is taking Fagan’s or any student's paper, and students all have learned to engage in error analysis respectfully and productively.

Further, the culture Denarius has built—and which we can see him reinforcing in this clip—communicates the importance of studying mistakes and reinforces a strong sense of psychological safety for students as they do so. Ironically, students in classes like Denarius's often come to love *Show Call*. If they don't love it, they certainly see the value of it. In observing how Denarius approaches the technique we can learn a lot about why. It's also worth noticing that *Show Call*, used frequently, reinforces accountability for written work. On tomorrow's problem set, students will be strongly incented—perhaps even motivated—to do their best work. This will result in better and better examples to share with the class.

Notice Denarius's actions when he begins his *Show Call* and how much importance he assigns to the task of shared error analysis. He deliberately ensures full attention—notice his formal body language (technique 58, *Strong Voice*) and his use of a brief positive group correction, “Waiting on one” (see technique 55, *Least Invasive Intervention*), before commencing. He is communicating the heightened importance of the upcoming task.

As soon as he begins the process of studying a student mistake, he deliberately reinforces a few essential cultural messages. “As I walked around, on a few of our papers I'm noticing that we're getting an incorrect remainder,” he says. Immediately it's a “we” issue. He's going to show one example of what is a classwide challenge. Message: It's our work we're studying, not just that of a single *Show-Called* student. “We have check mechanisms in place that we can use to check this,” he says, again stressing the class’s group ownership of the problem and the solution.

Now to Fagan's work. “Snaps first to Fagan for using long division,” Denarius says. “You didn't have to use long division. You don't have to use synthetic. There's even

another approach that I saw on Quinetta's paper... ." In introducing Fagan's work, the teacher first establishes that there is plenty of successful work in the classroom, even if they are going to improve something about it. Fagan's first instinct may have been to think, *Oh, I got it wrong*, but in fact she **didn't** get it all wrong. She got a *small piece* of it wrong and a lot of it right. She's doing fine, and he's helping her to see that.

Notice also Denarius's emotional constancy and how he treats the error as being completely normal. As I discuss in *technique 12*, *Culture of Error*, Denarius establishes that mistakes are interesting, valuable even, and definitely not something a teacher gets frustrated at learners about. This is not a culture where people are afraid to discuss a mistake. Why would they be afraid when mistakes have been established as a necessary and helpful part of the learning process and the examination of them is a completely routine part of class?

Students do most of the analysis throughout this *Show Call*, even when he guides them to recognize that they should use the remainder theorem. Denarius doesn't solve the problem; all he really does is tell them how to perceive that their answer does not make sense. Once he's guided them to that realization, they know how to solve it.

*Show Call* is a simple and powerful concept but one that can feel risky to try for some teachers. If you've never done it, you can imagine how you or your students would feel if it didn't work.

In light of that I will describe a typical progression—what *Show Call* might look like at different stages in a classroom so the pathway to a lesson like Denarius's becomes clear. The technique involves shared culture and routines that must be intentionally built. A *Show Call* is unlikely to look

like Denarius's the first time a teacher and her students try it.

An early *Show Call* could, however, look a bit like Paul Powell's in the video *Paul Powell: Show Call*.

The student whose paper Paul takes is Kahlila. Here's a still shot of him doing that. Paul's pretty nonchalant in his body language—casual (see `technique 58`, *Strong Voice*), but Kahlila is not. It's likely she feels a bit anxious; even if Paul has explained what a *Show Call* is and why he does it, she's nervous. *My paper? Oh no!*

That's why Paul's framing when he presents student work is so important. “The theme of the day is showing your work,” Paul says. “So I'm going to show off Kahlila's work.” Suddenly everything has changed.

important the reveal is in building culture. Kahlilia now knows that Paul's sharing her work is a good thing. He's showing it off.

“Look at that,” Paul continues, pointing out details of her now-projected work. “*Boom*. Formula. Plugged it in. Very neat. *Boom*.” If, a moment before, Kahlila's primary emotion was anxiety, it's now pride.

The culture Paul is building isn't simplistic, though. He's also sowing the seeds of self-study and improvement—a good-to-great culture. As he highlights the many things to love about Kahlila's work, he normalizes the process of making it better. “There's one little thing we're going to fix here in a second,” he says, making sure that the first few times he asks students to share their mistakes feel especially safe and nonthreatening.

A few moments later, Paul returns to the idea of improvement. “What is the one little thing she can fix?” he asks, and here is Kahlila's reaction:

craft or what exactly the experiment says about the role of ATP and they can't process the words and syntax at the speed of sight, you're likely to be disappointed. When you have to slow down to read, when the task of reading and making basic sense of the words requires conscious thinking, your working memory is allocated to figuring out the words, what they mean, and how they fit together, not to comprehending. Perhaps this is why the students who got fluency instruction—both those in regular classrooms and those who were struggling readers—“simply read better” than those who did not get regular work on fluency, writes Timothy Shanahan, who is among the nation's foremost researchers on reading. “For many students oral reading fluency practice continues to help in the consolidation of decoding skills [and] … helps to support prosody development which is more directly implicated in reading comprehension.”22

Reading aloud is critical to building fluency. It is the only reliable way to assess it and it provides students with the opportunity to practice the meaning making we express when we read aloud. To read something aloud is to interpret it and make arguments about it: In what tone should it be read? Which word gets emphasized? Think for a moment of how critical it is to know what the implicit voice of a text sounds like, not just for novels but for scientific research and historiography; now think of how often your students have heard those things read aloud. With FASE reading there’s constant modeling of how a text should sound but the model comes from fellow students. I will return to this when we discuss the social aspects of reading.

Reading aloud is the best way to practice fluency and it's beneficial for *all learners*, but once they have finished the elementary grades students no longer get opportunities to read aloud and build fluency. This gap is ten times more

important now when—and this will be another motif of this book—reading as we know it is locked in a death struggle with the cell phone, a battle it is losing badly. It's not just that students read less and less—the data are devastating—it's that they read less and less well. They are more distracted; in states of constant half-attention,23 their eyes flitting down the page looking for the next new thing. So it's not just that we build fluency and reading skills that translate into silent reading as well, it's that it is one of the few ways we can cause students to read for sustained, undistracted periods of time.

## A is for accountability.

“The only way we can ever 100% know that a child is actually reading is if they are reading aloud,” Jo Facer writes in *Simplicity Rules*. And it's the only way we can know *how* they are reading. Your class reading aloud is not just fluency practice, it's not just an exercise in creating community (which I’ll come to in a moment), it's a constant data stream on the reading level of your students on the key texts of your classroom. Nothing could be more data driven.

Making sure students are reading is a big deal—bigger now than five or ten years ago. Yes, I can hear some teachers saying, we should socialize students to read at home as much as we can. But note also that relying on reading happening at home is in part regressive—the strong readers are likely to get more of it—and we increasingly can't be sure that many students read steadily outside of school. We are all addicts to a device engineered to absorb our full attention. Our students are in its thrall the minute they leave school.24 “Any and all systems I have ever come up with [to ensure independent reading at home] have been gamed by students … If you want to ensure pupils are reading, your only bet is to make them do it with you, as a whole class. That's why things like whole class reading of a suitable novel … for 20 to 30 minutes a day are so

beneficial. If children have read that much for that long, they will have a massive advantage over their peers,” Facer writes.

## S is for social.

This is the hidden gift of *FASE Reading*. Shared experiences, especially ones with emotional weight or where significant ideas emerge, draw people into communities and give them a sense of belonging. This is what you are doing when you read together—building community and belonging and, not coincidentally, this is in part the role stories and texts have played in our society for longer than there have been schools. Stories and experiences were shared not just among groups but *in groups* as a way to draw people together. It is fitting that this aspect of reading may be our best bet now to elevate its stature above the lonelier forms of communication available through screens.

In *Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain*, Zaretta Hammond makes a compelling case for the importance of community in the classroom. We are the most individualist society on earth, she notes. Finding ways to balance ardent individualism with a communal approach is part of culturally responsive teaching—a key way to make the classroom more accessible to students from less individualistic cultures, she argues. At the same time it pushes us to see the benefits of greater emphasis on community and belonging conferred upon some other cultures that value it more highly.

The way we read sometimes reflects that ardent individualism, especially in moments where everyone chooses their own book and reads it on their own. There’s a common argument that students will only love reading if it involves individual choice and while some choice is nice,25 everyone always choosing their own thing means giving up what is collective—the shared text we can all talk about

because we've all read it and shared the experience of reading it together. One of the benefits of a collective task like reading together is that it builds belonging, the strongest incentive for humans there is. Ironically, reading and experiencing together often yields more enjoyment than does a setting where everyone gets choice. The moment when your class laughs or gasps aloud in the midst of a shared reading, a bond is made. The experience of reading together is as powerful to the brain as events experienced together and thus the shared connection it creates can help forge a lasting and valuable sense of community and belonging. If we want the experience of reading to be powerful and unique—social, shared, and pleasurable, more powerful than the smartphone—the key is to read communally and to emphasize that by reading aloud together.

## E is for expressive.

To read aloud well is to make meaning audible, to breathe life into a text. It's powerful when a teacher does this and it's even more meaningful when students do. It is a statement—peer to peer—that the text is worth bringing to life. To hear your peers take pride in their reading skills and show they value reading creates the sort of positive social norm that is most likely to shift reading behaviors. When students read aloud expressively, and when, as they do in the best classrooms, they implicitly compete to show who can read most expressively—they are not only bringing what you are reading to life, they are making the case for the book. Gabby Woolf does an exemplary job of this in the video *Gabby Woolf: Keystone*. Her class is reading *Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde*, Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 novella, which is full of archaic and unfamiliar syntax. To successfully bring it to life is to show that you understand the book. So as she begins, first modeling herself before she calls on students to *FASE Read*, she challenges students to bring out their maximum

degree of expressiveness. “In the spirit of being sensationalist, we want to read it as … Stevenson would want his readers to imagine it.” She encourages her pupils to volunteer “with your highly expressive reading” and notes, “I know several of you who would make a very good job of that.” And indeed the subsequent reading by her students is rich in expression and meaning made audible.

# The Challenges of Reading Aloud

There is joy and pleasure in reading aloud but there are also challenges, and these are also worth addressing because in many ways the purpose of *FASE Reading* is to address those challenges26—it's a classic case of technique making strategy viable. If you have the technique that allows you to overcome a few challenges, the benefits of a powerful strategy become feasible.

So what are the challenges? The reasons can be grouped in two primary buckets: leverage concerns and self-esteem concerns.

## Leverage Concerns

Some educators react to suggestions that they include more oral reading in class with a question along these lines: “Why would you allow a single student to read aloud during class time? What are the other kids doing?” The implication is, I guess: nothing. Having a lone student reading aloud to an otherwise passive classroom can indeed be a poor use of time. And of course it's possible that the reader's peers could be checked out and gazing out the window. But in a well-designed lesson, they would be reading, too, and this is both valuable and relatively easy to accomplish.

I use the term “leverage” to refer to how much reading the rest of the class is doing when one student is reading

aloud. If twenty-seven students are staring into space or listening passively, the leverage is low. But if one student is reading actively and twenty-seven students are listening carefully and reading along with her, as actively engaged in the text as if they were reading independently, then the leverage is much higher. It's also worth reflecting on the ease with which a group of people can discuss a text meaningfully when they have just experienced it together. There are no reminders: *remember the scene where this or that happened?* The memory of the scene is vivid in students' minds when you say, “Let's pause here and discuss.” So a second answer to the question “What are the other students doing?” is: They are preparing to discuss. Concerns about the passivity of nonreaders are legitimate, but they're fairly easily managed by specific teacher actions, which I'll discuss in a moment.

I've also heard concerns raised that both listening and reading along at the same time will overload students' working memory—that listening will prevent reading along—or vice versa. I'm not sure there's a clear answer to that, though there's a fair amount of recent research showing that the visual and auditory channels are additive in terms of working memory.27 Still, we can't rule out this concern. That said, reading is an immensely complex task that we use to serve a wide range of outcomes in the classroom. Among other things, we want students to learn decoding and fluency and vocabulary through reading. We want them to acquire knowledge through reading and be able to acquire knowledge through further reading of complex texts in particular. We want them to persist in reading, make a habit of it, and value it all their lives. It's unrealistic to think that any single approach is going to optimize that many diverse outcomes. Reading remains to me the first among equals—the most important among all the valuable things we teach in school—and my guidance would be to

have students read a lot in class, to have them read in ways that make a text feel valuable—buy-in, a colleague of mine says, is an outcome, not a precondition for any activity—and use a variety of ways of reading so that you get the benefit of multiple approaches.

In designing our *Reading Reconsidered Curriculum*, my team included three forms of reading in each lesson: *Teacher Read Aloud*, *FASE Reading*, and *Accountable Independent Reading* (see *technique 23*). The exact balance we suggest depends on the teacher, the class, and the text. But we suggest healthy doses of all three. (That's not advice I'd limit to the ELA classroom.) The video *Eric Snider: The Wind* is a great example of a teacher using all three ways of reading in synergy: Eric reads aloud, allows his students to read for a stretch—they crush it with the complex text, by the way—and then sends them off to (accountable) independent reading. If there's a weakness to any of those forms of reading, he balances them by using the others and still reaps the unique benefits of each approach.

## Self-Esteem Concerns

Some educators have also suggested that students should not be asked to read aloud in class because they might struggle—this might shame or embarrass them, and possibly cause them to dislike reading. Essentially, the argument is that if students are weak readers, we should withhold from them one of the best tools for improving reading skills because it might cause them discomfort. Learning to be comfortable struggling is, in my mind, a much more manageable and temporary challenge than being a weak reader. Teachers, and the cultures they build, are fully capable of making it safe to struggle and take risks. It's yet another reason why building a vibrant,

positive culture—not just avoiding a negative culture—is so critical in the classroom.

And fortunately everyone's reading is imperfect! So one critical step is to make this simple fact more evident. Balancing teacher read-alouds with student read-alouds is a great way to do this. If you read aloud you will surely make your share of stumbles and bobbles. I know I do. Not trying to hide them but instead making them seem normal is powerful. You could say “Whoops, let me start that sentence over,” or “Whoops, that's ‘flawed,’ not ‘flamed.’” Or you could say very little and just carry on as if it were the most normal thing in the world and let the data settle in on the class over time: Even the teacher stumbles. Having lots of students read also affords lots of opportunities for lots of students to stumble a bit, go back, reread, figure out a word—all of it public and in full view, even among the best readers. This normalizes an obvious aspect of reading that is otherwise hidden to students. The key is not to make weaker students feel like they should not stumble but to help them see that everyone does.

But of course some readers struggle more than others and it is precisely those students who struggle most who also benefit most from the practice. Planning, preparation, and culture building can address the challenges of this. Later I'll share with you a moment in Jessica Bracey's classroom where she demonstrates some excellent solutions. But first, this advice from Jo Facer: She writes that, initially, it is best to “select short, simple sentences before you teach your lesson, and underline or highlight these on your own copy. That way you will know the ‘safe sentences’ to get your struggling readers to succeed with.” Over time this will allow them to meet with success and build their confidence, she notes.

One observation implicit in this comment is the idea that people change—not only their skills but also their perceptions. You cannot control whether a student is nervous at first. But you can control environmental variables sufficiently to change that feeling in time.

There are of course other ways to manage the experience so that students gradually get better at reading by reading aloud. I’ll return to those in a moment. But for now I want to also point out that denying all students the opportunity to read aloud because some students might at first be nervous is wrong. All students deserve the right to connect with reading as a positive experience and teachers must ensure that all students develop mastery of the skill.

# How to Lead **FASE** Reading

How then do you unlock the benefits of student oral reading and mitigate its downsides? How do you ensure leverage and attentiveness and prepare for strugglers? When you lead **FASE** Reading, you ask students to read aloud, one by one, in an unpredictable pattern, usually for short durations, at least at first. By “asking” I mean most often assigning readers—*Cold Calling*. We want volunteers but we want universality and accountability, as well.

Everyone has to read—and hopefully come to love reading. “The weakest readers need the *most* practice at reading, but are also the ones who tend to volunteer *least* to read aloud, as well as the ones who opt not to read privately after school hours. To serve our weakest readers, it simply must be the expectation that every child can be asked to read aloud at any time,” Jo Facer writes. Here are some details on those elements.

## Keep Durations Unpredictable

One observation implicit in this comment is the idea that people change—not only their skills but also their perceptions. You cannot control whether a student is nervous at first. But you can control environmental variables sufficiently to change that feeling in time.

There are of course other ways to manage the experience so that students gradually get better at reading by reading aloud. I’ll return to those in a moment. But for now I want to also point out that denying all students the opportunity to read aloud because some students might at first be nervous is wrong. All students deserve the right to connect with reading as a positive experience and teachers must ensure that all students develop mastery of the skill.

## Keep Durations Unpredictable

If you designate a student to read in class and say, “Read the next paragraph for me, Vivian,” everyone in the class knows no one else will be asked to read until Vivian finishes the paragraph. *Stating the duration for which a student will read causes other students to follow along a little less.* Instead, when you ask a student to read, don't specify how long you want her to read for. Saying, “Start reading for me please, Vivian” or “Pick up, please, Vivian” makes other students more likely to read along, since they don't know when a new reader will be asked to pick up.

In addition, keeping durations unpredictable allows you to address a struggling reader in a safe and noninvasive manner. If Vivian struggles with the paragraph you've assigned her, it means either a long, slow slog to the end, possibly exhausting for Vivian and reducing leverage with other students, or it's you suddenly cutting her short of what you promised: “OK, I'm going to stop you there, Vivian. Jelani, would you please read some?,” which carries an implicit judgment. If you don't specify the length of the read initially, however, you can adapt in the interest of both the student who's reading and the rest of the class. Vivian can read two sentences really well and then stop before she struggles too much, making the experience positive, then you can move to a dynamic reader who will push the story along for the rest of the class. Or, if Vivian is doing well, you can let her keep going. All of this happens invisibly when you avoid telling students how long they'll read.

## Keep Durations Short

Reading short segments can often allow students to invest energy in expressive reading and sustain the energy required for fluent, even dramatic reading. It's better to read really well for three or four sentences and stop than to read well for two and drone through six more. Moving quickly among primary readers can yield higher-quality

oral reading and make the lesson more engaging. The momentum of quick, unpredictable, and relatively frequent changes of reader makes reading feel quick and energetic rather than tedious and slow.

Knowing that segments tend to be short and may end at any time also reinforces for secondary readers that they will likely soon get a chance themselves to read, and this keeps them from tuning out.

As students develop as readers, your definition of “short” will, of course, change. Maybe the average read is two or three sentences at first, but as students get better as readers and become more able to attend carefully, as they come to love reading and lose themselves more in the text, you will naturally extend the average length of a read. Sometimes you and the class will lose yourselves in a passage, and Vivian will just keep going. The key idea is that using shorter reads can bring engagement and energy to student oral reading—perhaps at the beginning of a passage, perhaps if things slow down, perhaps all the time. When and how often is up to you.

Finally, keeping durations short enables you to take better advantage of a crucial form of data: every time you switch readers, you gather data about your leverage. When you say, “Pick up please, Charles,” and Charles jumps in with the next sentence without missing a beat, you know that Charles was reading alongside the previous reader on his own. If not, you know otherwise. Ideally, you want this sort of seamless transition every time you switch readers, and frequent switching allows you to gather and manage transitions more often and more broadly. The more data you have, the more information and tools you will have to help you ensure leverage.

If you move quickly from one primary reader to another, students focus more closely on following along. This is doubly true if they don't know who the next reader will be. A teacher who announces that she'll go around the room in a predictable fashion gives away this part of her leverage. Students can tune out until their turn is near. Retaining your ability to choose the next reader also allows you to match students to passages more effectively. If you want to use Jo Facer's idea of preselecting sentences that developing readers can be more successful with, you'll need to be able to *Cold Call* readers and you'll need to select randomly.

Unpredictability makes for both better leverage and better reading, so when you call on students to read, it's great to call on some students who volunteer—the moment when they wave their hands in the air, desperate for their chance to read is a huge win for any teacher—just make sure not to call *exclusively* on volunteers. A significant proportion, most often a majority, of readers should include those who haven't raised their hands. This will maximize leverage and normalize full and universal participation. The message should be that reading is a pleasure and that a good teacher doesn't let just a few students hog all the fun.

## Reduce Transaction Costs

A *transaction cost* is the amount of resources it takes to execute an exchange, be it economic, verbal, or otherwise. When it comes to transitioning between readers, small differences in transaction costs can have a large effect, so it's critical to reduce them. A transition from one reader to the next that takes much more than a second steals reading time and risks interrupting the continuity of what students are reading, thus affecting how well students follow and comprehend the text.

Make it your goal to transition from one primary reader to another quickly and with a minimum of words—ideally, in a consistent way. “Susan, pick up,” is a much more efficient transition than, “Thank you, Stephen. Nicely read. Susan will you begin reading, please?” The first transaction is more than three times as fast as the second, maximizing the amount of time students spend reading. A couple seconds of difference may seem trivial, but if you transition fifty times per class, those seconds very quickly translate into minutes and hours of lost reading time over the course of the year. Just as important, reducing your transaction cost when switching readers causes less interruption to the text, allowing students to concentrate and keep the narrative thread vibrant, alive, and unbroken. If you make a habit of minimizing transaction cost, you can more easily switch at almost any natural pause in the text, giving you even more control over when to choose a new primary reader. Can you occasionally drop in a “lovely” or a “thank you”? Of course. Though perhaps even better would be to express it with body language or a quiet and appreciative comment while a student was still reading.

Let me show you how those things look in two classrooms: Jill Murray's and Maggie Johnson's.

We'll start with Jill, whose video *Jill Murray: Quartering Act* my team loves because it is from a Social Studies class. *FASE Reading* should happen everywhere. Some aspects of reading are likely domain specific in a way we rarely consider: A nonfiction text about a historical event sounds different from a novel. A scientific text has its own unique conventions and rhythms. Students in Jill's class are developing an ear not just for reading but for historical text.

common name “Control the Game”). The kids cheer! I promise we did not pay them to do that! But it suggests the powerful sense of joy and belonging fostered by shared reading. *FASE Reading* is a pleasure, they are telling us.

Jill starts by modeling. She's saying (implicitly): *Here is what a historical text sounds like read aloud*. And just as powerfully: *Here is how I'll expect you to sound when you read aloud*. She's norm setting. Notice how she doesn't race. Commonly students will try to show their skill by reading fast. She wants them to show their skill through expression—by making meaning audible—not speed. You can hear, too, that the text is challenging! But Jill's students persist with relish. They see one another openly embracing challenge—no one's reading is perfect, but everyone is OK with that. And of course as they work toward fluency at this level of complexity, Jill is gathering critical data. She is also teaching them to sustain focus and effort when the going gets hard. All those things—the persistence, the expression—will translate into their independent reading, as well.

Now let's look at Maggie's class: In the video *Maggie Johnson: Grew Serious*, her eighth graders are reading *To Kill a Mockingbird*. It's a challenging text but look how they rise to the occasion. Maggie goes first. Her reading is a model of expressive reading. Arshe is next. He begins reading ably but Maggie encourages a bit more expression: “You can give me a little bit more than that,” she says. Call it gentle encouragement, permission to be expressive. This is important. Reading is social and we want a memorable experience with the text and for students to create as much meaning as possible through their reading. We want students to see one another doing that.

Notice the faint smile on Arshe's face as he rereads. He reads beautifully. Suddenly the story does come to life a

little more. Maggie laughs and gently puts a hand on his shoulder to show her appreciation.

Arshe keeps reading. It's a complex text (Lexile 870) but with encouragement he's not only thriving, he's bringing a little more expression to his reading. Another appreciative chuckle from Maggie and then it's Brianna's turn. She's perhaps a bit more halting. Again Maggie is gathering data here on how well everyone can read the text. She asks Brianna to reread a sentence to ensure correct decoding, but she does so easily and with an appreciative laugh like the one she had for Arshe's reading. Brianna gets the point: you're doing fine; keep reading. And she does. Suddenly she's cantering along and crushing it on some very challenging syntax.

Maggie steps in next. She's able to read a bit faster. There are probably kids in the room who want to move the story along. Her bridging helps keep the momentum and their attention. Notice that she's chosen an especially critical passage to read herself and notice how slow and thoughtful her model is. Then she passes the reading to Mel and then to Ronnie, who responds to her request to use expressive reading to depict an irritated Atticus.

This is the only time she's taken a volunteer—the rest of the time she's selected the reader. But here she wants real energy, top-of-the-line expressiveness, and Ronnie does a beautiful job.

It's worth noting that you are seeing effect as much as cause here. Maggie's students read this difficult text so well and with such pleasure and appreciation because they *FASE Read* so often and because the norm of expressive reading is so well established! In Maggie's classroom, expressive, joyful reading is what you do. It's also worth noting that this is an eighth-grade classroom.

reading Maggie's class is doing—perhaps because teachers mistakenly think it's not beneficial for older students and perhaps because some teachers think they won't like it or won't do it. I hope the pleasure Maggie's students take in their reading gives teachers license and encouragement to read aloud with older students!

Now that you've got the idea, here are a few more key elements of the technique.

## Use Bridging to Maintain Continuity

Using *FASE Reading* combines two types of reading—student oral reading and teacher oral reading. As the teacher, you are naturally the best reader in the room. In reading aloud, you model the sorts of expressive reading you want from students—joyful, scholarly, what have you. You may choose to step in yourself and read especially important or tricky passages—your reading of them can bring the nuance of the text to life and help expedite comprehension. You can also use segments to resuscitate momentum after a particularly slow or struggling reader by stepping in for a few sentences, keeping the thread of the narrative alive and engaging for other students.

In bridging, a teacher takes a turn in the *FASE Reading* rotation, reading a short segment of text—a bridge—between student readers. In a typical sequence of bridging, a teacher might ask Trayvon to read for a few sentences, then Martina and then Hilary, and then read for a stretch herself. She might have planned in advance a part she thought she should read, or she might read to model expressive reading and bring the story to life a bit. She might read because Hilary really struggled, and the teacher didn't want the slow pace to cause other readers to disengage. She might step in more or less frequently.

Sometimes teachers will start the reading themselves to set the tone, occasionally even doing so transparently: “I’ll start reading, then I’ll ask some of you to pick up. Be ready!” Obviously, teacher reading needn’t always bridge. When you do so is obviously discretionary, and part of the art of reading well. Harder texts often demand more bridging—to create more opportunities to model, and to balance the necessarily high rate of slower student readers.

## Spot-Check, a.k.a. Oral Cloze

I learned Oral Cloze from watching Roberto de Leòn teach reading to third-grade boys at Excellence Charter School for Boys in Bedford-Stuyvesant. In one example, Roberto kicked off his reading of *Phantom of the Opera* by leaving a word out at the end of his first sentence: “Carlotta had the …,” he read, signaling to students with his shift in tone of voice that they should fill in the blank. On the day in question, only a handful of his boys chimed in “leading role” exactly on cue. So Rob started over: “Ooh, some boys weren’t quite with us. Let’s try that again. ‘Carlotta had the …,’ ” and all his boys chimed in with “leading role,” demonstrating that they were now following along. This quick device, which Roberto uses throughout his lessons, allows him to assess leverage quickly and simply.

## Use a Placeholder

As you move between reading and questioning students about what they read, it can be helpful to use quick, consistent prompts to ensure that students recognize the transition and react quickly. I call this prompt a *placeholder*, because it ensures that students retain their place in the text and enables a quick and immediate transition back to reading after discussion. “Hold your place. Track me,” announces Patrick Pastore, modeling for his sixth graders how to point to the spot where they left

off reading *Esperanza Rising*, close their books partway, and engage his eyes to show they are ready to discuss. After a brief discussion of why Esperanza and Miguel react differently to a train ride, he instructs, “Pick up reading, please, Melanie.” In less than two seconds, she and her classmates are back into the book at almost no transaction cost.

Similarly, Roberto de León might intone, “Finger in your book; close your book,” as he prepares his students to discuss *Phantom of the Opera*—and also prepares them to end that discussion and return to the book efficiently.

In the video *Jessica Bracey: Circle of Gold*, you can see Jessica, then at North Star Academy in Newark, New Jersey, executing a lesson with an effective segment of *FASE Reading* embedded in it.

You'll notice how engaged Jessica's students are as she keeps durations short and unpredictable, moving the reading around the room to involve lots of students. You'll also notice that even though she calls on a number of students to read, every single one picks up on cue—solid evidence that they're all reading along with her. But then again the best evidence of all comes after about a minute and a half. Jessica mixes in an opportunity for volunteers. “Please continue for me ...” she begins, and hands shoot into the air. Students love reading when it comes to life this way; their hands show how much they feel a sense of belonging. They want to be a part of the experience.

This is no small thing. These students are fifth graders. The various stages in their development as readers are passing quickly. Compare lots and lots of joyful practice for a developing reader to the alternative: the encroaching feeling for such a reader that reading is a source of embarrassment, something she will never be good at, something he wants to avoid. This can be, and is, a self-fulfilling prophecy for thousands of students.

A final note. Earlier I noted that one of the things I liked about the name *FASE Reading* is that a phase is a stage in a series of events. *FASE Reading* ideally is combined with and embedded in other classroom activities, such as five minutes of *FASE Reading* to bring the text to life and then a bout of writing about a text that seems vivid. Or ten minutes of silent reading with the text voice and setting brought to life. Or a discussion of the book we all just read. Imagine how much richer the discussion of *To Kill a Mockingbird* will be in Maggie's class after her students have heard the story come to life through Maggie's and Arshe's and Ronnie's readings. There's a lot more depth to respond to. Imagine also how much more likely they will be to pick up the book and read it that night for homework when it made them laugh together as a group that afternoon in school.

# TECHNIQUE 25: CIRCULATE

Where you stand as you work is a critical aspect of your teaching. It shapes the information you gather about students and helps determine the types of interactions you can use to guide and support them.

Can you stand naturally at a student's shoulder as she solves a problem correctly for the first time, quietly encouraging her and preserving her privacy: “Yes, that's it,” or “Much better,” or “Now you've got it!”?

This is no small thing. These students are fifth graders. The various stages in their development as readers are passing quickly. Compare lots and lots of joyful practice for a developing reader to the alternative: the encroaching feeling for such a reader that reading is a source of embarrassment, something she will never be good at, something he wants to avoid. This can be, and is, a self-fulfilling prophecy for thousands of students.

A final note. Earlier I noted that one of the things I liked about the name *FASE Reading* is that a phase is a stage in a series of events. *FASE Reading* ideally is combined with and embedded in other classroom activities, such as five minutes of *FASE Reading* to bring the text to life and then a bout of writing about a text that seems vivid. Or ten minutes of silent reading with the text voice and setting brought to life. Or a discussion of the book we all just read. Imagine how much richer the discussion of *To Kill a Mockingbird* will be in Maggie's class after her students have heard the story come to life through Maggie's and Arshe's and Ronnie's readings.

Can you subtly move to a spot near another student as you explain the homework, and therefore provide just enough gentle accountability to keep him on task and writing down the assignment?

Only, perhaps, if you can work the room simply and easily—if you can get anywhere in your room at any time without navigating a pile of backpacks or asking for the pushing in of chairs. In fact, if you have to ask for permission to get to any spot in the classroom or if it seems unnatural for you to stand anywhere, it’s not really your room and, more importantly, you may not be able to shape it optimally to support student learning.

*Circulate* describes rules and habits for a teacher's strategic and intentional movement around the room during all parts of a lesson.

## Step 1: Break the Plane

The “plane” of your classroom is the imaginary line that runs the length of the room, parallel to and about five feet in front of the board, usually about where the first student desks start.

Some teachers are slow or perhaps hesitant to “break the plane”—to move past this imaginary barrier and out among the desks and rows. They might spend the entire lesson moving back and forth from one front corner to the other. Or just leaning on their desk in front of the board. But breaking the plane adds energy to your teaching and allows you to observe what students are doing. You can linger beside a student's desk and subtly raise your eyebrows as you ask an intriguing question or place a warm and gentle hand on his shoulder as you progress around the room.

It’s important to break the plane early—within the first few minutes of the lesson, if possible. (One benefit of technique

The first step in MOP, then, is the rollout where you explain the default (and perhaps some of the other systems you'll use for participation) and why. It should be brief but compelling. Better to just describe the default and add short descriptions of the other formats later rather than talk it to death on the first day!

Ironically one of the best models I have of a teacher doing this is not a classroom teacher but a soccer coach, James Beeston. The soccer field is not the classroom, but I submit that there's a lot for every educator to learn from how James rolls out his expectations in the video *James Beeston: Switched on at All Times*. I've transcribed what he says below:

> The main thing from tonight's session ... It's going to require intensity from both a physical and a mental standpoint. I'm going to be asking you questions throughout, to check for understanding. Don't shout out the answer. That's a big, important thing because I want you to think about the answers that you're giving. If you know the answer and I go like that [raises hand], raise your hand. If you don't know the answer, that's OK. We'll work through it; we'll problem-solve together. Sometimes I might call on you guys even if your hand isn't raised, OK?, because the game requires you to be switched on at all times, so I am going to be calling on guys at times to make sure the focus is still there, all right, so we're locked in from the first minute to the last minute.

This “rollout” takes James about 45 seconds. He explains what he's going to do (“Sometimes I might call on you guys even if your hand isn't raised”) and why (“... the game requires you to be switched on at all times”). He tells them what to do when he initiates a routine (“... don't call out; I want you to think about the answers”). He sets his

standards high but he also makes it safe to struggle (“We’ll work through it; we’ll problem-solve together”). And then he immediately begins practicing what he preaches so players understand that he means it because they start building the habit right away.

In fact a second video of James, *James Beeston: How Can We Use This?*, shows him questioning his players a bit later (after they’ve practiced for 20 minutes or so). From a ratio perspective—how many participants think about his questions, how much of the time, and how deeply—it would be hard to do much better.

Sadie had a very similar rollout on her first day to set up her default. Then she layered in new routines and their cues using a chart like the following one, which captures some of the common routines students use to participate in class, the cues a teacher might use to signal them and some other factors to consider.

| **MOP** | **Expectations** | **CUE** | **Notes** |
|---------|------------------|---------|---------|
| *Cold Call* (or Volunteers) | Raise your hand. I may call on hands or may *Cold Call*. | Default "I’ll ask some of you to share" or "Be ready, I may *Cold Call*" to increase predictability. | Explain to students that if you don’t signal anything else it means (1) raise your hand, (2) do not call out, (3) be ready for a *Cold Call*. |
| Volunteers (only) | I am looking to only call on volunteers, but I want lots of them. | "Hands!" "Your turn." Nonverbal: teacher raises hand as she asks. | Have a reminder ready if there are call outs (nonverbal or "Hands, please"). |

# Frontloading

In a recent blog, London-based science teacher Adam Boxer shared an idea he called “frontloading” to get the most out of *Means of Participation*. His reflection started with the observation that even if you diligently communicate the desired *Means of Participation*, some students still may not hear it if it comes at the end of your directions. He gives this example:

*“What is the word equation for photosynthesis?  
Please write your answer on your mini-whiteboard  
and hold it face down until I ask you to show me.”*

“On the face of it, this is a good instruction. The question is clear and clear and the MOP is established in terms of how the students will write and present their answer,” Boxer writes, but he adds that you may still end up with students raising their boards before you have asked them. “The second you ask them the question, they start writing down their answer (or at least thinking about it) and they are no longer listening to you. It's not that they are being defiant or messing around, they just didn't take in the instruction. And again, it's not because the instruction isn't clear … it's a property of its placement.” He suggests frontloading—placing the *Means of Participation* at the beginning of the direction so that students hear it first and process it before they start thinking about the question.

*“OK, in a second I'm going to ask a question. Please write your answer on your mini-whiteboard and hold it face down until I ask you to show me. What is the word equation for photosynthesis?”*

If routines aren't firmly established, he suggests using a script more like this to build reliable follow-through:

“OK, I'm going to ask a question and you are going to one [hold up a finger], write your answer on a mini-whiteboard; two [hold up two fingers], keep it face down; and three [hold up three fingers], show me only when I say.”

You might even ask students to repeat that back to you if you're still getting routines built, Boxer suggests.17

Here are some of his examples of other frontloaded *Means of Participation* phrases:

- “By putting your hand up in the air, I'd like you to tell me ...”
- “Without calling out, can anyone tell me ...”
- “In silence, you are going to ...”
- “I'd wager ten quid that works better every time,” he notes.

# Online Lessons: *Means of Participation* Icons

The shift to remote teaching posed a unique set of challenges to teachers' working memory—challenges my team and I felt ourselves when we led trainings online. Like so many teachers, we often found ourselves using a presentation to structure our session. As we presented one slide we were often thinking of what the next slide covered, and trying to assess how our participants were responding to the session—reading their expressions, toggling over to the chat to field their questions or respond to their comments, prepping a breakout room. The new setting and the addition of technology resulted in working memory overload and it was shockingly easy to forget how we wanted participants to engage in the content of each slide. Even if we'd planned our *Means of Participation* we sometimes forgot to use what we'd planned at the right time and in the right way. Or we remembered but struggled to listen and respond as well as we could have. Our solution was to use icons to make our *Means of Participation* easy to remember so our working memory could be focused on participants.

We developed a set of icons that we placed at the bottom of our slides to remind us of the *Means of Participation* we'd planned:

Suddenly we didn't have to strain to remember what participation moves we'd planned. With our working memory free we could listen far better to the discussion and think more deeply about the content. We shared this idea with several schools and watched them do remarkable things with it. Memphis Rise, a school in Memphis, Tennessee, for example, standardized the icons across the teaching staff and gave teachers a glossary of the terms and guidance on how to use them well.

*Break It Down* is a powerful teaching tool, but it can be challenging to use because it is primarily a reactive strategy. It's useful immediately after an incorrect or insufficient answer.

How to respond effectively and efficiently in those situations is one of teaching's ongoing challenges. We know that repeating the question a little slower or louder isn't likely to help, but what do you do instead?

With *Break It Down*, the goal is to ask a question or present a piece of new information that will help the student answer correctly and will still cause the student to do as much of the thinking as possible. In the simplest terms, you want to provide the smallest viable hint, helping the student activate what he or she *does* know to get the correct answer.

In the video *Narlene Pacheco: Keystone*, you can see an example that shows both Narlene's skill and the challenges of the technique. Her kindergarteners are segmenting words—“bat” in this case—but one of her students has the letters out of order. She has b-t-a. “Segment bat for me,” Narlene says, carefully managing her tell (see technique 12, *Culture of Error*). When her young scholar does this correctly, she points at her paper: “What did you write?” It's an ideal *Break It Down* since Narlene hasn't provided any new information. She's just asked her student to review her work with heightened attentiveness. If her scholar was able to get it right now it would be based entirely on a self-correction. But she does not yet see her mistake.

“Read what you have,” Narlene now says, her second effort to *Break It Down*, but again it's not enough so Narlene goes a step further. “What's the first sound? Do you have that?” she asks. Her tone is impeccable: supportive, without a hint of frustration or judgment. “What's the second sound?” she continues. “Tuh” her student replies. She's narrowing her

focus to a specific part of the work that's challenging. “What's the word?” Narlene now asks. “Buh-ah-tuh,” her student says and in so doing catches her error and fixes it. Narlene has helped her student solve while doing as much of the work as she can, and her students is happy: She’s figured it out rather than simply being told.

# Smallest Viable Hint

A teacher never really knows what knowledge a given student has, nor exactly how big the gap is between what the student knows and what he needs to know to succeed. Because the ideal is to cause a student to apply what he knows to the greatest degree possible, it’s useful to try to provide the smallest (successful) hint possible.

Providing a minimal hint gets at the tension in *Break It Down*. Whereas one goal is to break things down to the least degree possible, another is to do it quickly, thus managing time and pace. Meticulously adding a thin slice of knowledge to each previous hint would be the perfect means of causing students to do the greatest amount of cognitive work, but would derail instruction in a series of exercises that destroyed your pacing and led to rapid frustration on your students' part.

Sometimes, in the face of a wrong answer, you’ll have to move on to something else. So while your long-term goal is to maximize the cognitive work that students do, you’ll also have to balance those long-term goals with practical short-term realities. The good news is that the more you use *Break it Down*, the better (and faster) your students will get at their half of the equation.

student to the correct answer. Your second goal is to keep your *Break It Down* rigorous by providing the smallest viable cue.

Take a look at the following figure. If you can provide a cue like A that makes the student fill in most of the gap, your student is likely to learn and remember more than if you use a cue like C. “Memory is the residue of thought,” Daniel Willingham tells us. There's more thinking to remember in A.

Both are more challenging than D, which solves the problem without any *Break It Down* (by giving the answer or having another student give the answer). Again, you want the smallest cue that will work in consideration of pacing, timing, rigor, and so on. A is desirable if you can, but you won't always be able to. You'll have to use D sometimes, too.

## Question: Where is the story set?

Desired answer: “In the northern part of Alaska near the Arctic Circle.”

Initial student answer: “The setting is in the North.”

- **A**: Roll back: “You said, ‘In the North.’”
- **B**: Narrow or eliminate false choices: “You said, ‘In the North.’ Where in the North? Are they speaking Russian?”
- **C**: Provide the first step: “Well, they’re on a journey, right? To take the ‘oblong box’ from one place to another. Where are they traveling from and to?”
- **D**: Responses that don’t *Break It Down*:  
  “The setting is in the northern part of Alaska near the Arctic Circle, Clara.”  
  “Can someone else tell us the setting?”

# Planning for **Break It Down**

One of the best ways to succeed with *Break It Down* is to prepare for it: with *Plan for Error* and *Exemplar Planning* (see *Chapter Two*), even if you don’t predict the precise error students make, over time you’ll get better at anticipating the kinds of things that students get wrong and the responses that help. You do an exercise like this, in other words, as part of a long-term investment in your own understanding.

As you plan to *Break It Down*—or even when you use the technique without planning—there are benefits to building your “range,” the types of prompts you’re comfortable using. We all tend to be creatures of habit; over time, our hints become predictable. Using a variety of ways to offer hints to students can help you connect with more kinds of thinkers, as well as provide a wider and more flexible array of help.

## Provide an Example

If you got a blank stare when you asked for the definition of a prime number, you might say, “Seven is one” or “Seven is one, and so is eleven.” If you wanted to *Break It Down* further, you could cue: “Seven is one, but eight is not.” You could then potentially take it a step further by observing, “Eight’s factors include two and four.” You can also provide additional examples if the question stumping the student was originally based on a category. For example, a student in Jaimie Brillante’s fifth-grade writing class struggled to identify the part of speech of the word *owner*. Jaimie cued: “Well, *owner* would logically be the same part of speech as other words that end in -er. *Dancer*, *swimmer*, *singer*. What are those?” she asked. “They’re people,” the student replied. Jaimie prompted, “And people have to be ...,” as the student chimed in, “Nouns!”

# Provide a Rule

In Christy Huelskamp's sixth-grade reading class at Williamsburg Collegiate in Brooklyn, a student guessed incorrectly that *indiscriminate* was a verb when used in the sentence, “James was an indiscriminate reader; he would pick up any book from the library and read it cover to cover.” Christy replied with a rule: “A verb is an action or a state of being. Is ‘indiscriminate’ an action?” The student quickly recognized that it was modifying a noun. “It’s an adjective,” she said.

# Provide the Missing (or First) Step

When a student in her fifth-grade math class was unable to explain what was wrong with writing the number fifteen-sixths, Kelli Ragain cued: “Well, what do we always do when the numerator is larger than the denominator?” Instantly the student caught on. “Oh, we need to make a mixed number. So I divide six into fifteen.”

# Roll-Back

Sometimes it’s sufficient to repeat a student’s answer back to him or her. Many of us instantly recognize our errors when they’re played back for us, as if on tape. You can see a great example of this in the video *Jessica Bracey: What You Said Is*.

Jessica is reading a novel called *Circle of Gold* with her fifth graders. She calls on a student, Gavin, to analyze the character Toni’s actions. His first answer is solid and he observes correctly that Toni is a sneaky character and that she is trying to trick Angel and Charlene into revealing their dishonesty, so Jessica follows up with another: “Why is that important?” Gavin does well here, too. It’s important because if Toni tricks them, she’ll reveal the truth about a stolen bracelet and defend her friend Mattie’s honor. Now

Jessica follows up again: “And what does that reveal about Toni as a friend?” This time however, Gavin gets stuck. He freezes and can't answer. To some degree this is inevitable … if we follow up good answers with further questions—be they *Stretch It* or *Right Is Right*—we are at some point going to get to the limits of what a student can answer at the moment. What then? How do we get the most out of them and foster success?

Jessica's response is simple and elegant. She uses a roll-back, simply repeating Gavin's words back to him: “So, Gavin, what you said is that Toni is sneaky and that she's a tricky person and that she's doing this because she is trying to get to the truth about who stole Angel's bracelet. Why is that important and what does that reveal about Toni as a friend?”

From there Gavin picks it up easily and closes out his analysis: this reveals that Toni is a helpful and good friend. She's trying to exonerate Mattie. He even uses the word “meticulous.”

It's a great moment. Instead of being “stuck” and not only possibly feeling like he'd failed, Gavin persists and does another layer of analysis. He closes it out with success, doing the cognitive work himself.

# A Couple of Finer Points

Notice Jessica's affect, which is neutral and emotionally constant as she re-asks the question. She's not annoyed with Gavin. There's no negativity in the roll-back but there's also no sticky-sweet to it, either. She knows he can get it. So she is steady at the helm.

She also avoids “tipping” (see *technique 32*, *Phrasing Fundamentals*). That is, she's careful not to give too much

You're studying the water cycle and you ask for an explanation of what happens to water vapor when it reaches the atmosphere. A student replies, “You get evaporation—water vapor forming droplets that become clouds.” This is wrong, of course. He has confused evaporation with condensation.

Saying “You said, ‘You get evaporation—water vapor forming droplets that become clouds,’ ” without discernible emphasis on any word makes your roll-back much more rigorous than if you said something like: “You said ‘You get *evaporation*—water vapor forming droplets that become clouds.’ ” Emphasis on the word “evaporation” points the student to the fact that it is the error and he can much more easily make the correction. So managing inflection as Jessica does in the video builds rigor.

To be fair, if your student still couldn't answer your evaporation question, your next move might be to add some emphasis, but you'd want to start with the least hint possible because you want your student to do as much of the analysis as he can.

Jessica then wraps it up with another nice move. She reinforces Gavin's work positively—“That was really strong thinking” and then asks for positive reinforcement from the class.

# Eliminate Choices

When Jaimie Brillante's student struggled to recognize that *owner* was a noun, Jaimie could have eliminated some false choices as follows: “Well, let's go through some of the options. If it were a verb, it would be an action. Can you or I owner? Well, what about an adjective? Is it telling me

# Fighting Rigor Collapse

Rigor collapse refers to what happens when you ask a hard question that students can't answer and progressively *Break It Down* until the big question is a question that now lacks the rigor of the original.

Scaling down the question gradually and cautiously so that students do as much of the cognitive work as possible is generally a good thing, but how do you achieve that without having a class consisting of simple, or even simplistic, questions?

In a lesson my team and I recently observed, a class was reading *The Outsiders*, and the teacher had asked students about the following exchange between Cherry, a “Soc” (that is, someone in a higher socioeconomic class) and Ponyboy, a “Greaser” (of a lower socioeconomic class):

> “You read a lot, don't you, Ponyboy?” Cherry asked.

> I was startled. “Yeah. Why?”

> She kind of shrugged. “I could just tell. I’ll bet you watch sunsets, too. I used to watch sunsets, before I got so busy. I miss it.”

The teacher asked what Cherry meant by “before I got so busy.” Cherry was the sort of person who was likely “busy” doing things like schoolwork and activities, the sorts of things on her side of the class divide, whereas Ponyboy was not. They could have been kindred spirits—watchers of sunsets—but class and caste expectations (at least partly) put them in different places.

The kids didn't get this. When asked, students postulated that the sorts of things Cherry was doing included “going shopping and hanging out with friends.” Because hanging out with friends was what Ponyboy would do, the teacher tried to break the complexity down a bit. “Can anyone connect this to the phrase ‘the rat race’?” (They had discussed earlier Ponyboy’s use of the term to disparage trying to succeed and cross the class divide.) Again students struggled to make the connection. So the teacher tried to break down the misunderstanding even further, hoping students would recognize the differences in how the two characters spent their time. Who was more likely to take music lessons? she asked. Cherry or Ponyboy? Why? Ponyboy didn't have parents to supervise him. If this was one sort of thing she might be doing when she was “busy,” what were some others?

The good news is that the teacher uncovered and addressed the fundamental misunderstanding among her class, but the result was also that a rigorous, metaphorical conversation with implications about socioeconomic class had been replaced by a literal one. The sequence ended with a small and narrow inference about who was more likely to take music lessons and never got back to implications about character or class: rigor collapse.

After winnowing questions, then, it’s often important to make broader sense of the answer students gave. Imagine, for example, if the teacher were to say something like, “Good; now connect that to one of the themes we’ve discussed from the book,” or “Good; now connect that to our discussion of class divide.”

If *Breaking It Down* takes a broad question and narrows it, a last move of connecting the narrow to a broader point is sometimes necessary.

build off of Nyesha's idea?” or “Marty has made an important point!” or “Almost, Mahaira, but I think you’ve left something out.” Only at the end after three comments from students does he step in, asking the class questions about a hypothetical example in which Drayvon works in a factory and asks for more pay.

In addition to socializing strong *Habits of Discussion*, Jason is *Batch Processing*, establishing very short sequences in which students have mini peer-to-peer discussions even within other lesson activities, such as direct instruction or questioning (see [Chapter 6]()). Jason doesn’t have to stop class and announce: “OK, we’ll have a discussion now.” Merely by letting three students have turns directly in a row and not taking a turn himself until the end, he allows a mini-discussion to emerge naturally. He speaks only after three students have offered their commentary rather than responding to each individually. Rather than playing tennis (comments going student-teacher-student-teacher-student-teacher) in Jason’s class, they play volleyball: the comments go student-student-student-teacher.

You can see another example in the video *Josh Sullivan: Say More About That*. As they respond to his question, Josh chooses to let three students speak in a row without comment from him. Or at least without verbal comment. His expression and gestures and the notes he silently writes on the board show that he is listening and that ideas of merit are emerging as students speak. In an environment where strong norms like *Habits of Attention*, *Habits of Discussion*, and of course volunteering through hand-raising are in place, this can facilitate short bursts of student-to-student discourse in the midst of other activities.

Obviously the key is to resist mediating every comment and allow short strings of three or four students to speak in a row. (Then you can step in to comment and steer.) But it’s

also important to model thoughtful, attentive listening. Not only does this reinforce the importance of student comments, but it helps you resist talking since much of what we say between comments is designed to show the sort of interest and approval we can often express without words. I personally prefer saying students' names rather than just pointing at speakers and it's also sometimes useful to add low-transaction-cost reminders of established discussion norms, such as, “Build on that, Henry.” It's still *Batch Processing* if you speak between student comments as long as what you say is merely to manage the process (i.e. choose who's next) as opposed to commenting on ideas. And of course it can still be beneficial for the teacher to comment on ideas offered during *Batch Processing*—you just have to wait a bit so students get to talk to each other first.

Another benefit of *Batch Processing* is that it meshes perfectly with our understanding of deliberate practice. Short iterations of spaced practice will build a skill more completely than larger but less frequent doses. Do something a little bit every day—for two minutes, say—and you'll get better at it than if you do it twice a month in a larger block—forty minutes, say. In one school we worked closely with, where students were especially adept at discussion, the key to transformation was the principal's request that all teachers take one minute during every lesson to practice the fundamentals of peer-to-peer discussion. That small amount of daily practice turned out to be more productive and easier to orchestrate than the more elaborate forms of discussions that required fifteen hypothetical minutes everyone was hoping would still be there at the end of a lesson.

thought would be a challenging and interesting question, set a clock for two minutes, and then stepped back and let students talk and respond directly to one another with little mediation or intervention from him except to identify the next speaker. He found two minutes to be plenty of time, and transparently using a timer brought out the best ideas—students had to make valuable contributions, not fill time—without letting things go on for too long. Suddenly he could drop into a two-minute discussion at any point: *Let's pause as Kennedy and his cabinet are planning their response to the missiles and put two minutes on the clock. What were some alternative actions they could have considered?*

Some other points Ryan made about his daily *Batch Process*: he's always disciplined about making the conversation connect to the central idea of the lesson. And he trained his students carefully on *Habits of Discussion* so they were effective at responding to building off each other's ideas. Ryan would step in to guide students in staying on task and avoiding off-task comments, straying from the topic, or not developing the previous idea. Those actions are part of the final technique in this chapter, *Disciplined Discussion*.

My colleague Hannah Solomon, who has made a habit of running schools characterized by rigor and joy, offered some suggestions to consider if you choose to try this idea:

- Student preparation is critical for this to succeed—kids need to be clear on the question, have ample processing time (preferably in writing, so teachers can use *Cold Call* to stir the pot if the conversation slows), and have received support in how to respond to each other (i.e. *Habits of Discussion*) before the teacher sets the timer and sits back.

- Teachers need to choose intentionally whether or not to summarize key takeaways at the end of the two minutes—either by clarifying misconceptions or by stating something like, “Let's keep wrestling with this challenge as we move forward.”

- Teachers should be transparent about the *Means of Participation*—is it all volunteers or some *Cold Calls* or some other model?

- One challenge with techniques similar to this in younger grades is that so much misinformation can get shared that teachers then need to tidy up after—so the role of knowledge feeding is important to consider. This is an activity that works much better when everyone has learned a lot and has strong background knowledge.

# Charting Aids Discussion by Aiding Memory

One way to help students stay on topic and validate their classmates' ideas is to help them to remember them. This may seem trivial but we know that people can only keep one or two ideas in working memory at a time and that recall fades quickly. Thirty seconds after hearing Kimani's great idea it will be hard for his classmates to remember exactly what he said. You can write a brief reminder on the board. “Jonas alarmed by feelings bc he doesn't know what they are” or perhaps simply “‘Jonas doesn't know what feelings are’—Kimani.”

Now students can think about Kimani's comment. Remember it. Refer back to it. Even with several comments made in between, they can use *Habits of Discussion* not just to build off of the most recent comment but those that happened several minutes ago. It provides the assist when a student says, “I'd like to build off of what Kimani said earlier about Jonas not knowing what feelings are ...”

You can do this on the whiteboard, the overhead projector, or chart paper. It's important to note that it is different from *technique 22, Board = Paper*, because students may well *not* be writing what you write. You are the memory scribe. Their job is to listen. Here's Jessica Bracey doing that as Omar comments in her Keystone video.

# Charting Aids Discussion by Aiding Memory

One way to help students stay on topic and validate their classmates' ideas is to help them to remember them. This may seem trivial but we know that people can only keep one or two ideas in working memory at a time and that recall fades quickly. Thirty seconds after hearing Kimani's great idea it will be hard for his classmates to remember exactly what he said.

She is helping to keep his idea alive for students to use throughout discussion and you can see the results.

Of course, as with anything else, there's some explicit instruction to be done. Students won't know what you're doing and how to make use of it when you chart unless you tell them: *I'm writing down key ideas up here so you can refer back to them and tie your ideas together. It will help us have a real discussion where we connect and remember one another's ideas.*

An effective discussion needs a shared purpose—on two levels. It needs a specific topic participants tacitly agree to discuss, and it needs a shared mental model of what it means to discuss something. If people are just trying to prove they are right, it's a debate. Discussion should involve some reflection along the lines of, what have I, or we, learned here? And a discussion is often better if it's cohesive. “If you chase five rabbits you catch none,” a friend of mine says, meaning that if you try to talk about everything, you resolve nothing.

With that in mind, here's a key moment from a discussion in Rue Ratray's English class, taped when he taught at Edward Brooke Charter School in Boston. The discussion was about Lois Lowry's novel *The Giver*, specifically the relationship of individuals to authority. The community was very accepting of government dictates, students observed. Then a student named Sofia commented that Jonas was an exception. He was “not willing to accept or agree with the ideas of the government.” Rue called on another student, Khalid, but Khalid suddenly shifted the subject.

“Carol and I talked about how we liked this phrase that …”

“Wait a minute, Khalid,” Rue enjoined. “What do you think about what Sofia said?”

When Rue redirected Khalid before he could share his idea, he risked disrupting his train of thought. He might forget what he had been about to say. Why do that? The reason is that Rue's eye was on the long game—he was reminding Khalid that a comment too disconnected from the previous comment or topic detracted from discussion even if it was interesting to him. Rue was teaching students a critical aspect of having a successful discussion by reminding them of the self-discipline necessary to discussion. Effective contributors to a discussion recognize when changing the subject detracts from the overall conversation. Giving

students the opportunity to practice the skills of discussion means supporting them as they develop this meta-awareness.

Unfortunately, in many classrooms, the moment when someone finishes a thought means it's open season; there's no expectation that the next comment will stick with the same topic and the result is conversations that have a fractured and scattered feel. In fact, students will often say, “What I was going to talk about was …” which implies that they are changing the topic (and that the previous comment was relatively unremarkable). Do this enough and you prevent the substance and depth that come from wrestling with the nuances of a specific issue. And it suggests to previous speakers that their comments weren't worth making. Why keep contributing if you say something you've been thinking about and it's ignored by the next speaker as if it never happened? It's easily overlooked, in other words, that one of the most important characteristics of a good discussion is topicality.

Ryan Miller used a similar move in a recent lesson. Students were examining primary source documents about President Teddy Roosevelt's intervention in Panama. One student commented that Roosevelt's claims that the United States was not involved were an effort to hide the government's intentions. The subsequent student made a sudden change of topic, almost as if the previous point had never been made, so Ryan stepped in: “That's interesting, but I'd like to hear someone respond to Sara's comment before we move on to another one.”

Ryan’s and Rue's goal in these interventions was to have students internalize a mental model of discussion that includes self-discipline and a recognition of the need to read one's audience among participants. In a good

## Managing the Meta

This is an example of what I call *managing the meta*, the first part of the technique *Disciplined Discussion*, which encourages focus and self-awareness in discussion. That sometimes requires keeping a discussion “inside the box,” and reminding students “Let's stay on our original topic right now” or asking, “How is this connected to the topic at hand?”

## Intentional Reflection

The second part of *Disciplined Discussions* is *intentional reflection*, an adaptation of *stamping*, a term Paul Bambrick-Santoyo uses to describe writing after a discussion in which participants summarize key ideas or, in this case, reflect deliberately on questions like: “What did I (or we) learn from our discussion?” or “How did your opinions change?” Writing about these topics gives them importance and permanence and ensures that time spent in discussion isn't wasted. As Paul Kirschner and colleagues remind us, learning is a change in long-term memory. The discussion may be rich but unless students remember it, they won't have learned much. Writing helps bridge that gap.

The more time you spend in discussion, the more important it is to make sure that clear takeaways are framed and the process of encoding them in long-term memory is begun. *Intentional reflection* means a discussion doesn't just end with the teacher saying it's over. It ends with the teacher saying something like:

> “Take a minute to jot down your takeaways from the discussion.”

Or (to emphasize listening a bit more): “Take a minute to jot down a summary of some of the more useful comments from your peers.”

Or (to emphasize openness to new ideas): “Take a minute to jot down the ways your perspective changed in the course of the discussion.”

This would also be a great occasional application of *Art of the Sentence* (technique 41):

“Great discussion. Two minutes now to capture your most important takeaway in one carefully crafted sentence.”

Or, “Great discussion. Two minutes to capture the two differing points of view we heard in one complete sentence.”

Of course you don't have to be a purist about using *Art of the Sentence*. *Silent Solo* could suffice. “Two minutes to capture the three key historical events we discussed and how they were connected. Go!”

I prefer writing over *Turn and Talk*, though. Writing encodes ideas more deeply in memory—we remember what we think about, Daniel Willingham tells us, and writing is usually a harder form of thinking than talking. Plus it leaves students with a written record they can refer back to.

Interestingly, in her Keystone, Arielle Hoo concludes her class discussion of parallel overlapping lines with a written summary, but she makes it a shared class activity. She provides a sentence starter and various students contribute ideas. She refines and selects from among them, creating a summary that is superior in content to what any single student could have created. Students then copy this down as their record of the proceedings. My team and I call this sort of written summary—one that’s both a shared creation and curated by the teacher, one that results in an exemplar of higher quality than any individual might produce—a

# Managing the Meta—The Case for Inside the Box

We tend to valorize “thinking outside the box.” The phrase evokes creativity, cognitive leaps, and the raw stuff of insight. In classroom discussion, however, keeping it *inside* the box—staying focused on a specific topic, maintaining steady, deep reflection on all sides of an idea—is often more valuable. Of course, the two aren't mutually exclusive, but there is a certain tension between them. Students sometimes reach for comments that are far afield rather than focused and topical because they believe that's how “outside the box” happens. We sometimes even encourage their doing so. Still, if we don't teach students how to keep insights on topic, we are guaranteed great leaps sideways, occasionally at the expense of forward progress. Let me give you an example.

I spent some time observing classes in a school near me, and one of the things that struck me was the way the discussions differed among classrooms. In some, students made relevant and insightful contributions. In others, comments were interesting to the student who made them, but not as useful or thought-provoking to others. They were arcane and solipsistic—smart, perhaps, but so self-absorbed that it was hard to say. The curious thing is that I was observing the same group of students in different rooms. I started to wonder, “Why were they so alert to their peers' perspective in one class and the opposite in another?”

In one classroom, the teacher asked, “What is fairness?” One student answered with an obscure quotation from a comic book that no one else had heard of. Another replied

that it was like pizza. They veered from one obscure analogy to another. They were certainly outside the box. The teacher too made obscure connections. The text they were reading was like “that commercial on TV.” Then it was “like that song,” and he quoted some lyrics. He called these text-to-text connections, but they weren’t. Their effect was not to cast the text in a new and revealing light but to distract the class from any sustained reflection on it. Student comments mirrored his choices. They referred to something arcane or comprehensible only to them and he never helped them think about how useful their comments were to others. Perhaps his mental model was vague and he didn’t envision discussions as being characterized by comments that were topical and timely. I once had a professor who would occasionally respond to comments, “How does that relate to what we were just talking about?” His doing so helped us see very quickly that discussion was not just about us and our desire to talk about what thoughts were on our minds, but about the mutual goal of developing shared insight on a topic.

The power of framing expectations about discussion was evident in the math class many of the same students had been in earlier in the day. It was their first day studying rate of change, and their teacher had just observed that time was almost always an independent variable when it appeared in a rate-of-change problem. “It’s going to be your independent variable 99 percent of the time,” he said. He asked students if they had any questions. Several ensued in which students reflected on how certain rate-of-change problems would be represented on a line graph. Then a student asked for an example of a situation in which time could be the dependent variable, and the teacher said, “To think of an example, I’d have to come up with something pretty obscure. Maybe we’ll do that later, but for

now let's just assume it's going to be the independent variable."

Despite his hint, another student raised her hand and began brainstorming “what ifs,” wondering aloud how time might become a dependent variable. It was great that she was asking herself this question, and although many teachers might have encouraged it, her comment was less useful to others in the room. The teacher was trying to help the class come to a collective understanding of rate of change at a conceptual level, not to digress into an area he'd just indicated was not worth the time. His response was brilliant: “You're thinking outside the box. But I want us to focus on thinking inside the box right now, on really understanding rate of change, what it is and how it works. So let's stay there right now.” Then he smiled genuinely and sincerely and they went back to talking about rate of change.

Although some teachers might be reluctant to circumscribe discussion in this way, his doing so was immensely productive. Essentially he said, “Here's what we're doing as a group right now. That's something you should pay attention to when you speak up—what the group is trying to do and why.” Part of a teacher's responsibility is to teach students when and how to participate productively in a discussion.

In short, you *manage the meta* when, through feedback and modeling, you guide students in the dynamics of building conversation, specifically how to make the kinds of comments that are most productive in a given setting. Rather than assuming they know how to make a discussion valuable, you invest in teaching them as they struggle forward. Perhaps there are times when you want *more* outside the box. If that's the case, you might use meta comments like, “I want to hear some people who are willing

to make some broader connections.” Either way, managing the meta relies on two key tools: modeling the kind of participation you want in a discussion and providing constant supportive feedback on how to engage your peers in a meaningful, connected, and mutually productive way.

1.  Most people, you may have noticed, are confident that this applies to people other than themselves.

2.  We should realize another risk: students often recognize that expressing ardent opinions—even ones they may not truly hold—shows interest and is a route to a higher grade. Colby may well know that punching up his passion about the Kansas Nebraska Act is a great way to enhance his grade.

3.  To be clear, there are times when we encourage talking to allow students to process or to increase Participation Ratio. This is great, but is different from discussion, when we must support students in remembering and building their skills for the listening portion of the process.

4.  There are several vignettes about this in *The Hidden Lives of Learners*.

# Chapter 10 Procedures and Routines

I wish everyone could have seen Sam DeLuke and Meghan Hurley's second-grade classroom at Troy Prep Elementary School on the day I visited recently. When I first walked in, I found Sam sitting in one corner, listening in on five students discussing a chapter book. As I inched closer, I overheard students making sophisticated statements like “I think you missed one piece of evidence, Zariah” and “I agree with David's point and want to develop it” (see technique 44, *Habits of Discussion*). In another corner, Meghan read a book about ants aloud to ten students who hung on every word. In the center of the room, six students sat engrossed in the pages of their independent reading, while another group had hunkered down to draft paragraphs explaining the theme of a story they had read.

A few minutes later, on Sam's cue, one of the groups from the center put their things away, stood, and walked quietly to Meghan's corner. Others, who did not transition, kept working away. Later, with a subtle gesture and without ever interrupting her instruction, she prompted a student to distribute books to peers who didn't have them.

Students in Sam and Meghan's class worked in an atmosphere of independence and self-management. Executive function is usually described as including the following sorts of skills:

- Paying attention
- Organizing, planning, and prioritizing
- Starting tasks and staying focused on them to completion

- Understanding different points of view
- Regulating emotions
- Self-monitoring (keeping track of what you're doing)

Students paced themselves and managed their own time. They listened carefully and drew out the best from their classmates when they worked together. The room seemed to run itself.

Paradoxically, the autonomy and self-management that were so much a part of the student experience were the products of structure and planning; students had made habits of a series of procedures Sam and Meghan had designed—how to work at your desk; how to manage materials; how to move from place to place in the room; how to ask for help if you were confused and the teacher was busy teaching others—and it was this very structure and planning, ironically, that allowed for greater autonomy. The moments when a brief reminder from Sam initiated a perfectly orchestrated transition were not in contrast to the moments when students worked at their desks with independence; they allowed them, fostered them, and made them productive.

Sam and Meghan had invested heavily in their *procedures*, which provide students with explicit guidance on how to execute recurring tasks such as working independently, transitioning between small groups, and answering questions in class. During the first few weeks of the year, they relied on constant practice to reinforce expectations. If you'd seen them then, you might not have understood where it was all leading—Why all the structure? Why all the “just so” with every little piece? Why so much focus on the *process for moving from place to place or participating in discussion*? But each of those “just so” pieces took its place within a system, a network of procedures that allowed Sam

Students paced themselves and managed their own time. They listened carefully and drew out the best from their classmates when they worked together. The room seemed to run itself.

Paradoxically, the autonomy and self-management that were so much a part of the student experience were the products of structure and planning; students had made habits of a series of procedures Sam and Meghan had designed—how to work at your desk; how to manage materials; how to move from place to place in the room; how to ask for help if you were confused and the teacher was busy teaching others—and it was this very structure and planning, ironically, that allowed for greater autonomy. The moments when a brief reminder from Sam initiated a perfectly orchestrated transition were not in contrast to the moments when students worked at their desks with independence; they allowed them, fostered them, and made them productive.

Sam and Meghan had invested heavily in their *procedures*, which provide students with explicit guidance on how to execute recurring tasks such as working independently, transitioning between small groups, and answering questions in class. During the first few weeks of the year, they relied on constant practice to reinforce expectations. If you'd seen them then, you might not have understood where it was all leading—Why all the structure? Why all the “just so” with every little piece? Why so much focus on the *process for moving from place to place or participating in discussion*? But each of those “just so” pieces took its place within a system, a network of procedures that allowed Sam

and Meghan to teach students habits that ultimately led to more independence. Over time, these procedures became automatic, or *routine*—students could, for the most part, execute them on their own. From that point, Sam and Meghan could afford to give their students autonomy because students knew how to manage it productively and because teachers could initiate it, adjust it, or correct it with a single word or gesture.

This is an idea that is not unique to the classroom. Classroom procedures and routines like Sam and Meghan's represent essentially the intentional internalization of shared classroom habits.

And habits, it is worth noting, have a profound influence on our lives. They become keystones. You develop a healthy positive habit in your life like reading or working out and it's more likely to result in your developing others. “Typically, people who exercise start eating better and becoming more productive at work. They smoke less and show more patience with colleagues and family. They use their credit cards less frequently and say they feel less stressed. Exercise is a keystone habit that triggers widespread change,” Charles Duhigg writes in *The Power of Habit*. This sort of behavior looks like self-discipline—well, it *is* self-discipline, but self-discipline made easy. Productive habits make it easy to be productive. And this is important for students because studies find that self-discipline predicts academic performance “more robustly than ... IQ,” Duhigg writes, and has a “bigger effect on academic performance than does intellectual talent.”

This chapter is the study of the way we develop shared positive habits in the classroom. That discussion can benefit from definitions of some key terms:

- **Procedure:** the design a teacher establishes for the way she and her students will efficiently and productively execute a recurring task or action in the classroom.

- **System:** a network of related procedures that help teachers accomplish end goals: help students maintain an organized binder, manage behavior, move materials, participate successfully in a discussion, and so on.

- **Routine:** a procedure or system that has become automatic, which students do either without much oversight, without intentional cognition (in other words, as a habit), and/or of their own volition and without teacher prompting (for example, note-taking while reading).

In the video *Nikki Bowen: Stand Up*, originally published in the book *Great Habits, Great Readers* by Paul Bambrick-Santoyo, Aja Settles, and Juliana Worrell, you can see Nikki's impressive system for students switching literacy groups. Not only does it maximize time for learning by making transitions fast, but it ensures that students arrive at each station with minds focused and ready to learn. Within seconds they're off and running. Among other things, this is a great example of how the terms *system*, *procedure*, and *routine* intersect. Nikki's system for transitions is actually made up of a series of separate component procedures. Once students learned the procedures, practiced them, and linked them together smoothly as habit, they became a *routine*. Separating the *system* into a series of *procedures* allowed Nikki to break the learning process into chunks (in consideration of students' working memory) and to apply the chunks in other classroom systems as well. All of her classroom transitions start with “Learner's Position”—that is, students showing they are attentive and ready—and the process of

My goal in this chapter is to pull back the curtain a bit and reveal the ways in which teachers like Nikki, Sam, and Meghan use procedures and routines to create rigorous, joyful, and orderly classrooms that grant students real independence. At the beginning of the chapter we’ll look specifically at two familiar and important routines that are linked to form a system for the beginning of class: *Threshold and Strong Start*. After that, we’ll study *Habits of Attention*, which is a routine for basic social interactions by and among students during learning. But of course a great classroom has far more procedures and routines than that, so afterwards, we’ll explore the “how” behind designing and installing procedures and routines so that you can set up students for success in your classroom and beyond.

It's worth noting also that teachers' own routines are a critical part of a successful classroom. **Chapter Two** is really a study of preparation procedures that hopefully become routine. How you circulate and observe for data are other examples of critical teacher-facing routines.

A word about the collective power of routines before we push on: Let's say everyone in your class had their own routine for getting their materials out and could complete the process in a few seconds. Would it be just as good as a shared routine where everyone does it the same way? Better even? Everyone accomplishing the same task in the same handful of seconds, each by doing it their own way sounds a lot more compelling. Why, this is to say, do routines have to be collective?

The first reason is that it makes them easy to support and manage. It's a long shot that everyone could find their own way to do that same thing—you'd be unlikely to get the outcome you wanted—but even if they did you'd be hard-pressed to help a student who struggled without steps to guide him through, even with the understanding that there was a right way to do it. You'll need to make sure your notebook is in your desk every morning when you unpack as opposed to asking, *Well where do you usually like to keep your notebook, in your backpack or in your desk?* As the epically disorganized child who was the one least likely to figure out the right way in middle school, I can also tell you that I was among the least likely to take anyone's guidance on how to be more productive. I didn't get it and so I didn't see the wisdom of, and was resistant to, what people were trying to tell me.

execute procedures on their own. This sets up students for failure. With younger students you may wish to practice in isolation—that is, to separate the practice from the context in which it will be executed and be very deliberate: “Let's practice pushing in our chairs and getting ready to line up now.” We often see teachers with the most effective procedures using Pretend Practice—that is, distorting practice deliberately in ways that make it less realistic but more focused and effective at building skills. For a transition in an art room where there are lots of materials, you might start by having students practice without materials first to get the routine down and then add back in the crayons and the glue and the paint to make sure they can do it at full complexity—and full potential for spillage—when they already know their way through it.

## Here are some ways you might see Pretend Practice:

1. *Isolated step*. Sometimes teachers will choose just one small aspect of a procedure and practice it over and over or at half speed to make sure their students get it. Only then will they speed it up to real time or link it to the steps before and after it.

2. *Strategically simplified*. Sometimes a teacher will remove a distraction to make practice more effective—for example, by practicing a transition without books the first few times (“Imagine you're carrying your books”) or by practicing the process for putting materials away in art class without the actual supplies the first few times. That way students can lock in on the steps with simplicity and without pencils and crayons rolling around on the floor.

3. *Faux errors.* Other times, a teacher will ask students to deliberately make a common error to role-play how to respond. “What do you do if you go to the left if everyone is going to the right? Let's try it and work it out.”

    With older students, the practice is much more compelling if it's embedded in real content, even relatively simple orientation content. The video *Mallory Grossman: Quick Poll* is a great example. Mallory contrives a way for students to practice their new routines three times over the course of the first lesson. My colleagues on the *TLAC* team and I have also come to believe in something else Mallory is doing here—embedding practice of procedures in content for students above the primary level. This allows the students to feel the benefits of the routines and makes practice more natural.

    A common mistake is to stop practicing once a routine appears stable. Routines require periodic maintenance to make sure they stay in ideal running order. Occasional feedback or a *Do It Again*—“Whoops, we were a little slow getting started with our *Stop and Jot* or our *Turn and Talk* there. Let's practice that again”—is important. And remember the *Forgetting Curve*: to learn something students have to begin to forget and then come back to something—usually multiple times. And a strong routine in October does not guarantee a strong routine in December. A little refresher, even before it is becomes necessary, is always smart, doubly so because you can practice without implying anything is wrong: “Let's be super attentive to our *Habits of Discussion* or *Habits of Attention* today.”

responsibility to students. Doing so gives students a greater sense of accomplishment, independence, and ownership over classroom structures.

Recently, we taped a lesson to watch Maggie Johnson's eighth-grade English class at Troy Preparatory Middle School and uncovered a hidden gem in the first few seconds of the video.

“Pencils down when you hear the beep,” she said, referring to the timer that's about to go off and signifies the end of independent work. “No countdown today.” In fact, there would be no countdown as part of Maggie's routine for the rest of the year, she later told them. Maggie was transitioning her kids from one highly effective system to another—replacing a teacher-narrated countdown with a simpler, faster, and more mature system wherein her students come to attention on their own at the beep. Maggie's countdown system was very effective, and sometimes it's the things that go well in our classes that we hold on to hardest—sometimes for a fraction too long, or that's the risk at least. In Maggie's case, despite the effective system already in place, she realized either that as eighth graders, her students were ready for a bit more autonomy and self-management, or that eliminating the countdown would be faster and less disruptive to the work they were doing, or both.

In short, what we were observing in Maggie's class was a transfer of ownership. In effect, Maggie was saying, “You've proven you can master this part of being scholars on your own, so now I give you more autonomy. You ‘own’ the rate at which you earn more freedom to self-manage.” This can be a powerful trade, especially when students understand that the autonomy is earned via mastery and follow-though.

- **Say "You're Ready"**: Remind students that you are giving them more autonomy in appreciation of their maturity and responsibility ... that they've earned it. It's often great to make this a gradual process since it's better to give than to take away.

- **"You Know"**: As you remove scaffolding, add language to make your actions transparent. Remind students that (1) they know what to do, and (2) you are aware of and appreciate this. “You don't need reminders from me anymore... .”

- **A Little Less in Sync**: You can transfer responsibility to students by simplifying a routine or eliminating steps, or by simply allowing them to complete the procedure without requiring that it be done in exact coordination with classmates.

- **Shared Leadership**: Let students assume leadership roles—cuing their classmates to begin stages of a routine, monitoring or evaluating its success, modeling for others, having specific jobs or responsibilities.

A caveat is important here: some teachers assume that because earned autonomy is an effective form of transferred ownership, they would do well to transfer ownership at the outset with a tacit bargain: “I'm going to give you a lot of autonomy, but I want you to show me that you understand how to use it, or I'll take it away.” This is usually less effective. Unless you've started with discipline—teaching and establishing what routines should look like—students won't know what you mean by “how to use it” and will likely struggle. Your choice will then be to remove the autonomy you initially offered—potentially messaging that the systems you now establish are a punishment rather than “how we do things,” and undertaking a more difficult installation (taking away freedom is harder than giving it)—

# Better Late Than Never: Tips for Rebooting Procedures and Routines

Procedures are best installed and routinized at the beginning of the year, but there are always times when a new procedure or system (that is, a set of related procedures) needs to be installed midyear. Culture has begun to slip, or morale to wane. You realize several months into the year that there's something you wish you'd routinized from the outset. Perhaps you've even arrived new, midyear, and in the wake of a teacher without systems and have been asked to rebuild the culture. A classroom “reset,” which often involves rolling out brand-new systems and reintroducing or modifying old ones, can be a necessity. Before you reset, consider these tips to ensure that it goes as smoothly as possible:

- **Set a goal:** Connect the reboot to an inspiring, headline-grabbing goal or important date—right now or in the future (for example, “We only have 60 days left until we take our comprehensive exams. We need to be ready so we're going to sharpen up the little things”).
- **Reboot after a break.** Take advantage of these periods away from class; they provide you with a natural excuse to reintroduce old procedures or to make a clean break from the past. (“We're just back from the long weekend and it's a good time to get all our procedures sharpened up so we're really focused and engaged for our next novel.”)

If you don't, you risk confusing students and losing their buy-in. “Sometimes when we do things over and over, we get a little sloppy with our execution. It's normal for everyone, but it's causing us to lose important learning time that you need to get ready for college. We're going to think back to when I taught you X at the beginning of the year—we'll review what we need to do and practice doing it not just well, but perfectly.”

- **Coordinating with your team.** Coordinating your reboot with other teachers at your grade level, in your hall or across the school, provides more consistent reinforcement for students and thus easier and quicker change.

- **Follow up with precise praise.** Acknowledge progress, and praise students who exceed your expectations. If students pick up the procedures with less practice than they did at the beginning of the year, recognize their growth. This shows students that your reset isn't a punishment or indictment, but rather an expression of your belief in their ability to meet your high expectations.

# Props

Props are a form of public praise for students who demonstrate excellence or exemplify virtues. If you can consistently enable classmates to deliver resounding praise to one another in two seconds flat, you can build a culture that valorizes achievement and effort without sacrificing order or time on task. As students come to relish the culture of Props, you might even teach them a wide variety of them (see the end of the chapter for a list of suggestions) and let a student nominate Props for a classmate who did a great job.

The key is to invest the time at the outset to teach students to give Props the right way: crisply, quickly, and enthusiastically, just as you would with any routine. Ensuring that you teach your students to deliver Props that meet the following criteria will go a long way to ensuring your success:

- **Quick.** You should be able to cue a Prop in one second. Similarly, the Prop itself should be fast because you don't have time to waste and because there's nothing less energizing than an exhortation that starts strong but peters out. If it's not sharp, reinforce with *Do It Again* (*technique 51*, later in this chapter) and make sure to get it right.

- **Visceral.** Props are often powerful when they rely on movement and sound, especially percussive sound. Props that don't use much in the way of words are less likely to get tiresome; their half-life is longer because there's no phrase to wear out. A quick “Oh, yeah,” is fine, but something like “On the way to college!” is likely to get old (and show its age) quickly. Furthermore, there's something fun

- **Universal.** When you give Props, everybody joins in. It's up to you to set and enforce this expectation.
- **Enthusiastic.** The tone is energetic and lively. It should be a break—brief and fun—from hard work. Resist the temptation to make it too grown-up; it doesn't have to narrate values and express a mission-aligned personal credo. If it's a little bit of silly, it will reinforce moments when students have already demonstrated those things. Props are the exclamation point, not the sentence.
- **Evolving.** Let your students suggest and develop ideas for Props. They will constantly renew the systems with fresh and funky ideas and will participate more vigorously because they have helped invent them. And if students are forever thinking of new ones, Props will never get tired, boring, or obligatory.

# TECHNIQUE 51: DO IT AGAIN

Routines give students a clear model of how to execute common tasks successfully and clear working memory for higher-order tasks. If the transition is quick and automatic, students' minds can be free to roam or to reflect on content, like yours on your drive to work, perhaps. The more familiar the routine, the more it benefits your classroom and your students, in other words. What that implies is lots of practice. Practice with feedback and correction is the only way to build a habit. That's where *Do It Again* comes in.

we have not done something as well as we might, the most productive response is simply to do it over, a little better, a little sharper. This response—“That wasn't quite right; let's try it again,” or “That was good, but let's try it again and see if we can be great”—is far superior to the alternatives: either ignoring the issue and letting quality of follow-through degrade, or chastening students for poor execution, or loading up their working memory with feedback they don't really get to use. By having students strive to do it over and better, you leverage the power of repetition and practice to painlessly build strong culture and self-discipline.

*Do It Again*, in other words, is the perfect tool to help maintain proficiency at something your students know how to do. It can as easily be applied to math procedures—“Try that again and make sure your decimals are lined up”—and classroom habits—“Just a minute, guys. Carlton, please start your answer over again and we'll all make sure we're giving you strong eye contact while you're speaking.”

In a range of situations it's effective because:

- *It shortens the feedback loop.* Behavioral science has shown that the shorter the time lag between an action and a response, the more effective the response will be in changing the behavior. Let's say you have a clear expectation for entering the classroom, and a group of students comes in from recess in a disorderly way. Having the group stay in for recess three hours later is less likely to change their behavior than is a lesser response that occurs right away. If the reaction comes immediately after, while the original action is fresh in the students' minds, the two will be more clearly associated in their memory. In the three-hours-later scenario, they will be more likely to think, “She kept me in for recess.” In the moment, they are more likely

to recall and reflect on how they entered the classroom. *Doing It Again* shortens the feedback loop in comparison to almost any other consequence.

- *It sets a standard of excellence, not just minimal follow-through.* *Do It Again* is appropriate not just for times when students do something poorly; it's ideal for times when students do something “just fine” when the goal is excellence. Saying, “That was good, but I want great” or “In this class, we're going to strive to do everything world class; let's see if we can use a bit more expression when we read” enables a teacher to set a standard of excellence, where good can always be better and better can always shoot for best. This can drive your classroom culture by replacing acceptable with excellent, first in the small things and then in all things.

- *It promotes group culture and accountability.* Although individuals can easily be asked to *Do It Again*, the technique is especially effective as a response to group endeavors. If three or four students don't bother to engage in the *Turn and Talk* the best solution may be to pause the whole class and say, “Just a second. A couple of us might have been distracted at the beginning of that *Turn and Talk*. It's important that we all engage the question and our partner. I'll cue you again and I look forward to seeing your best conversational skills. Go!” As an aside, there are times when it feels wrong to hold groups too accountable for individuals who try to co-opt their purposes. Suffice it to say that because you can leverage group accountability does not mean you should in every situation.

- *It ends with success.* The last thing you remember of an event often shapes your perception of it more broadly. *Do It Again* ends a situation where a process was done

with insufficient quality with success. The last thing students do in a sequence is to do an activity the right way. This helps engrain the perception and memory of what right looks like. It also helps build muscle memory. Students build the habit of doing it right, over and over. In fact one of the most interesting times to *Do It Again* is to encode success. As in: “That was perfect. Do it again just like that so you remember just what it feels like.” The “it” could be a math problem or playing a perfect eighth note. In fact, watch the video *John Burmeister: Trill*. In it, John, who is one of my favorite music teachers, is teaching cello to an individual student. Notice how many times she plays a trill in the course of learning it—eleven times, actually. Sometimes because it's not quite there; sometimes to add a layer of detail; sometimes to encode success—three more just like that.

- *It is reusable.* As John's cello video shows, *Do It Again* can be reused frequently so you always have a way to respond that's productive. You don't need to keep inventing new responses. You can be positive in administering the third iteration: “I still think we can do this even better. Let's give it one more shot!” Add a stopwatch to some routines, and the challenge of *Do It Again* (and do it better) only becomes more powerful.

However, it's important to execute the technique well. *Do It Again* should be positive whenever possible, with a keen focus on getting better and, in a great classroom, informed by a constant narrative of “good, better, best.” That is, “just doing it” gets replaced by doing it well. In fact, one colleague suggested that a better name for this technique is *Do It Better*, as better captures the idea that doing things over again to be as good as you can be is what school is

about. The goal is not merely compliance but excellence, even in the little things.

*Do It Again* can be an effective tool for managing affect. Sometimes people's attitudes change from the outside in. Asking a low-energy class to repeat something with enthusiasm (especially, and critically, while modeling those attributes yourself) can start to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. *Do It Again* is a great opportunity to challenge students positively to show you their best. Saying, “Oooh, let's line up again and prove why we're the best reading group in the school” is often better than saying, “Class, that was very sloppy. We're going to do it again until we get it exactly right,” even if the purpose in both cases is to *Do It Again* until you get it exactly right. You can see Kirby Jarrell do a lovely job of that in *Kirby Jarrell: Go Brown*. The class is timing themselves at how long it takes to get materials from the previous class put away and to have their novels out and ready. Michaela is running the clock and she reports that it took 48 seconds, an excellent time, so Kirby playfully decides to celebrate by having her kids say, “48 seconds? Go Brown!” [They're nicknamed after the university]. Students do it and the energy is a bit mixed. With a warm smile and a bit of bravery—everyone wants to cut bait when an idea appears not to work—Kirby playfully asks students to do it again with more enthusiasm. And they do it! And the energy level rises in the class and students appear energized a bit. It's a tiny throwaway moment but imagine—maybe Kirby keeps the chant for next class, maybe she doesn't—but imagine the message if she'd just let the mediocre follow-through remain the end point. The message might have been *Oh, that was awkward. If Ms. Jarrell asks you to do something silly just wait it out and we'll give up on it.* Here it ends pleasant and off-handed but at no loss to her enthusiastic and playful classroom culture.

Lastly, teachers sometimes think they need to wait until an entire routine or activity is done before asking the class to try it again. In fact, you should have students go back and try it again as soon as you know that the level of execution will not meet the standard you set for it. Don't wait for the routine to end. Again, this will better connect the stimulus to the response. Let's say students are lining up for lunch, and the drill is to stand up quietly, push in their chairs, turn to face the door, and then follow the table leader to the door. If students forget to push in their chairs, have them sit back down and try it again right then. This saves time and reinforces instant accountability.

# Putting It All Together

In the video *Montage: Do It Again*, you can see a few intriguing video examples of *Do It Again* in the classroom. You'll have to watch carefully because they come and go fast, which is part of the point. The less fuss, less disruption, and less censuring of students, the better. Simple and clear, nonjudgmental, and even positive when possible. You can see that in Erica Lim's class. She's starting for the day and wants to make sure to set expectations for follow-through on the greeting. It's not a big thing, yet you don't have to do it if you don't want to make follow-through questionable on all tasks. So she offers a simple and quick and emotionally constant reminder of what she knows her high schoolers know how to do. Denarius Frazier, too, is emotionally constant. If we're going to try to use tools that build positive culture and show appreciation for success, they'll be positive only if they are universal. When the response is spotty, Denarius asks quickly for a redo—the quicker the better—and is almost deadpan, showing a hint of a surprise. Much better, he says, when students follow through. He's reinforced this routine and the norm of follow-through on all such routines.

It's a tiny but important movement and it's the simplicity of the responses and Denarius's lack of fuss that makes it successful. Sarah Ott's approach is similar and different. When students are slow in wrapping up and responding to her, she's playful and upbeat and energetic rather than steady, but she still gets her *Do It Again* done fast. It's a technique that usually gets more out of less.

# Chapter **11**
## High Behavioral Expectations

A classroom must be orderly for learning to take place.

Some educators will take exception with that statement.

“Not at all,” they might say. “Learning is messy, chaotic, loud, and unpredictable. Disorder is part of education.”

But what they'd mean by disorder would be a classroom in which, after forty minutes of the frenetic building of suspension bridges with toothpicks and gumdrops, everyone cleaned up nicely and the teacher had a few moments to ask with a puckish grin: “Well, class, what have we learned?”

They'd mean a class where young people enthusiastically engaged in a ramshackle discussion with lively disagreement—about a book that everyone had read and had a copy of at the ready.

They wouldn't mean a classroom where it would take them ten minutes to get students to hear and follow directions for the bridge building or a classroom where students who raised their hand during the discussion risked violating powerful, unspoken social norms. Or where a student muttered and smirked every time the two girls in front of him spoke out loud. Or where they had to wonder what that student was saying under his breath to the girls.

What they would mean by disorderly would be just the right amount of untidiness and unpredictability when they'd chosen it, designed it, and delegated it. Order, in other words.

# Chapter **11**
## High Behavioral Expectations

A classroom must be orderly for learning to take place.

Some educators will take exception with that statement.

“Not at all,” they might say. “Learning is messy, chaotic, loud, and unpredictable. Disorder is part of education.”

One of the core challenges of teaching is that it is very, very hard to create classrooms reliably characterized by psychological safety and where students encourage the best from one another; where, when necessary, students can think deeply amidst quiet and develop their capacity to pay attention; where some students' desire to pursue learning assiduously is honored and supported, even when others don't really feel like it.

It's far easier to say that order doesn't matter, or is counterproductive. It's easier to claim that a teacher's responsibility to be able to judiciously enforce quiet is the same as a craven desire to suppress student voices. It's easier to argue that the exercise of benevolent and necessary authority is a form of authoritarianism and to conflate those similar sounding but very different words. Establishing orderly classrooms is an ideal place for the Band-Aid Paradox.1

Democracy, in a classroom, is problematic when twenty-eight people want to learn chemistry and two want to persist in making hilarious burping noises. The twenty-eight do not require a mere majority to proceed. They need unanimity. One or two students' freedom to make those clever noises or to say no to the idea of listening and following directions is often a *de facto* decision for everyone else in the room. The lesson will not proceed as planned.

This is an age-old challenge but also one that is increasingly difficult to bridge. Our society is the most individualistic on the planet (adapting to its individualism is one of the biggest challenges for students who come here from other cultures) and it is growing more so by the moment. There are precious few times and places where people will accept that they must be willing to constrain their own behaviors and desires for the common good. This

used to be taken for granted; people were proud to do their part and raised their children to expect to as well, but no more. The refusal of some individuals to wear masks to help mitigate an epidemic, for example, underscores how hard it is to socialize such actions in our society. And yet schools are among the last institutions that ask for and depend on this increasingly unfamiliar behavior—where a greater common good (learning and knowledge for all) is achieved through small personal sacrifice (show, or perhaps even feign interest in what your classmates are saying even on days when you don't really feel like it).

At any given moment, the students in your classroom will be a mix of the stoic and the impulsive; the selfless and the selfish; the virtuous and the thoughtless; the wise and the silly.2 Hopefully more virtuous and wise than thoughtless and silly, but surely some of both. And in that mixture, the rights of those who dream of atoms and cell structure or insight into Grant's mindset as dawn broke over Vicksburg are fragile. They require protection. The more virtue and wisdom among the majority of your young people, the more imperative that you protect their right to learn in an optimal setting. And let me say a word here for the silly—of which I can say I was often one. Part of teaching is graciously and humanely preventing the puckishness of the child inclined to occasional silliness from becoming a bar to their own and others' learning. Short-sighted decisions by young people are to be expected. Everyone chooses hilarity over chemistry at some point. That such inclinations are natural and common does not mean that we should indiscriminately allow them, or that constraining them need be cruel or harsh—the opposite, in fact, and with skill such actions can feel like (and be) a form of caring. There is plenty of room for laughter at the right time.

distracted and wants Emily's attention and is going to miss out on the learning. I'll unpack the details of her lovely interaction to get him back to learning later in the chapter, but it's not just her tone that expresses love and caring. It's the action itself. It will matter that Joshua learn the content of this lesson and learn to be a scholar if he is to thrive. To care about him is to get him back on track.

“It is not possible for everyone's desires to be met at the same time as everyone else's,” Tom Bennett reminds us in *Running the Room*. “At times individual wants will be balanced with the greater good of the community… . It is impossible for everyone to behave as they please.” This is to say that you cannot be a teacher and not be prepared to ask or require some students to sometimes do what they are not inclined to do. Doing so is the exercise of the responsibility we are entrusted with, not the abuse of authority.

And—here comes a summary of what this chapter is about—most of the tasks required of us to ensure the right kind and amount of order can be done warmly and graciously, in a caring manner and often with a smile. With skill they can be made less visible (in fact one of the main skills I try to point out in *technique 55, Least Invasive Intervention*, is making them as invisible as you can) and can be stripped of caustic emotions (*technique 56, Firm, Calm Finesse*). Or, even better, moments of conflict can be headed off and prevented before they even happen. Or many of them can. We cannot all achieve Emily Bisso's state of grace in the Joshua interaction; not every interaction can be solved quite so simply and happily. But the goal is to remember what Emily is telling us as much as what she is telling Joshua: *I do this because I care and in being attentive to my technique I am most able to do it in ways that help students thrive*. In fact, Emily's success is as much a result of her mastery of “quiet presence,” “economy of language,”

and “live in the now” (elements of *Strong Voice* I discuss later in the chapter, and of *Positive Framing*, which I discuss in the next chapter) as it is of her intention to be caring. Nobody takes this job because they want to shout at young people and have caustic interactions with them. But teachers by the thousand do so every day. They do so because the situations we are placed in as teachers are immensely challenging. They require more than good intentions to resolve optimally. They require technique. The grace that a teacher like Emily shows, we should all understand, is at least in part technique in disguise.

But before we go to technique it is necessary to establish that to excuse (or worse, justify) disorderly classrooms is to allow precious opportunity to be stolen from young people —usually the most vulnerable. Teachers are invested with authority to ensure that certain rights are protected precisely because those rights are preciously important and require everyone's cooperation to sustain. And teachers for the most part are insufficiently trained and prepared for this small but critical part of the job.

This is no small failing. A recent national survey of teachers³ found that *more than three quarters* (77 percent) believed that “most students suffered” because a few students were persistently disruptive. But of course, school problems, like everything else, are not evenly distributed in society. In schools with more than 75 percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches, more than half of teachers⁴ went further and said that “student behavior problems contributed to a disorderly or unsafe environment that made it difficult for many students to learn.” For those who might be wondering, the authors also disaggregated the results by race of teacher and found few differences. On the question of whether student behavior “contributed to a disorderly or unsafe environment that made it difficult for many students to learn,” for example, Black teachers

There is a tendency among some educators to equate orderly classrooms with higher rates of suspension and other harsh disciplinary consequences, but in fact the opposite is the case. Norms are the most pervasive influence on the behaviors of individuals. Students are more likely to engage in more extreme behaviors in environments in which those behaviors appear plausible or even common, where things spiral quickly out of control, where there is little learning going on, where there is peer pressure to test limits, and where the culture does little to check this impulse. Sadly, when this is the case, students often feel tacit pressure to engage in behaviors they don't especially want to do and know are wrong. Every principal will tell you that some portion of suspensions are of young people who lack a positive and productive relationship to school, and some portion are of kids who like school and want to succeed there and nonetheless do something dangerous, stupid, or mean-spirited in a way that seems utterly out of character. A teacher who can use the tools in this chapter to establish a warm, caring, and humane learning environment that offers consistent limits is engaged in the work of preventing suspensions.

There is a final element to an orderly classroom that is also easily overlooked. “Self-discipline, self-regulation, hard work, [and] patience,” Tom Bennett writes in *Running the Room*, are all “enormously important characteristics of successful people in a variety of contexts… . Everything of value you can conceive of was acquired through sustained effort, practice, and delayed gratification.” An orderly classroom builds these habits—you want to speak but you discipline yourself to listen first; you are tired some days but complete your tasks regardless.

Productive and positive behavior, in other words, is part of an invisible curriculum in schools that reinforces executive functioning skills and allows students to thrive. Students

That's a key realization: we are always influencing motivation. The moment when we have a good long talk with students about effort and motivation may help, but less probably than the daily habits students fall into, the pervasive influence of what those around them do, and the compounded effect of a thousand small interactions we have with them when our minds are on something else.

One of the requirements of motivation—particularly for those students who begin with a skeptical attitude—is trust. Students have to come to believe in the endeavor of school and, as a result, be willing to try. I say that trust is a requirement but not a prerequisite of motivation because building trust can take time. It has to happen eventually for teaching to take hold. That does not mean it has to be there for you to start. Trust can take a long time—longer than you have before you start teaching. Happily, teaching well is one of the primary ways trust is built.

My colleague Dan Cotton framed for our team a model for how trust is built that continues to be meaningful for us. To feel trust, students have to feel safe, successful, and known.

Feeling *safe* means being physically safe—students can't feel at risk of being bullied or threatened—but also psychologically safe—it has to be OK to try, to be wrong, to take risks. There can never be snickers for trying and failing or, worse, for trying at all. As Zaretta Hammond writes, “Neuroscience tells us the brain feels safest and most relaxed when we are connected to others we trust to treat us well.” If we truly want our students to be prepared for the transformative experience of learning, then we must establish for them that the classroom is a place in which they belong and will be respected.

That's a key realization: we are always influencing motivation. The moment when we have a good long talk with students about effort and motivation may help, but less probably than the daily habits students fall into, the pervasive influence of what those around them do, and the compounded effect of a thousand small interactions we have with them when our minds are on something else.

One of the requirements of motivation—particularly for those students who begin with a skeptical attitude—is trust. Students have to come to believe in the endeavor of school and, as a result, be willing to try. I say that trust is a requirement but not a prerequisite of motivation because building trust can take time. It has to happen eventually for teaching to take hold. That does not mean it has to be there for you to start. Trust can take a long time—longer than you have before you start teaching. Happily, teaching well is one of the primary ways trust is built.

My colleague Dan Cotton framed for our team a model for how trust is built that continues to be meaningful for us. To feel trust, students have to feel safe, successful, and known.

the institution—knows them and sees them as both a part of a community and as an individual—not just one of a group of students in third period or eighth grade. Of course that means they have to know that their identities and cultures are welcomed and valued, but in a much more everyday sense students have to feel seen, literally and figuratively—with the literal often causing the figurative. This is often expressed in small moments. Using student names, and inventing opportunities to greet students by name, is hugely important, for example. Saying someone's name is a small reminder of something larger: that we know them for themselves; that we see them in the crowd. One of the reasons I love it when teachers greet students as they enter the room is so they can say, “We missed you yesterday,” “I love your hair,” “Are those new glasses?” and, yes, “Make sure to get me your essay; it was due yesterday.” That, too, tells a student they matter. But Denarius Frazier (see *Denarius Frazier: Remainder*) is also making students feel known when he circulates in his math class and sees their work and the products of their minds. “Much better,” he tells one student. The message is: “I saw what you did today and how it was different from what you did yesterday.”

*Successful* is perhaps the easiest of the three elements to overlook, though its role in motivation is larger than most people realize. Motivation, Peps Mccrea explains,1 is “as much a product of learning as it is the driver of it… . If we care about building motivation for the long run, we must prioritize proficiency. It is the ultimate self-fulfilling engine of education.”

Accomplishing a task successfully and learning that they can succeed leads students to want more. That's why effective teaching that leads to student mastery is one of the greatest long-term sources of student motivation and trust. Part of why Christine Torres's students love and trust

her and work so hard throughout each lesson is her skill as a teacher. Every day they enter a place that’s orderly and productive and see themselves learning and accomplishing things. They feel capable and accomplished and, naturally, like that feeling. Peps Mccrea calls this “scholarly identity” and it often comes from the outside in. They see themselves doing well at English and conclude they must like and value English.

But motivation is shaped most of all by norms. That’s the hidden secret. It’s the most important factor and it’s mostly invisible to us. People are evolved to be supremely social—think here of the “cooperative eye” hypothesis—and will be inclined to do what the group is doing even without realizing it. “Norms are so powerful they override more formal school policies or rules. However, their largely invisible and unconscious nature makes them easy to underestimate if not totally ignore,” writes Mccrea. Norms will emerge, in any setting where there are people, and they will shape behavior. It is merely a question of whether they are deliberate or accidental norms. In many schools it is the latter.

The strength of a norm’s influence over us, however, also depends on how much we feel a part of and identify with those exhibiting the norms. Motivation is mediated by belonging.

What I focus on in this chapter is how to make students feel belonging, trust, and motivation, so that teachers find a receptive audience for learning. Put another way, this chapter describes rules of thumb for the daily interactions with students in which motivation and trust are built.

People are motivated by the positive far more than by the negative. Seeking success and happiness will spur stronger action than seeking to avoid punishment. “When we are happy—when our mindset and mood are positive—we are smarter, more motivated, and thus more successful. Happiness is the center, and success revolves around it,” concludes Shawn Achor, summarizing years of studying happiness. Positivity inspires and motivates and that should influence the way we teach. But positivity, particularly in learning settings, is often misunderstood.

One flaw is the assumption that praise is the same thing as positivity. *Praise* is telling someone they have done something well. *Positivity* (in this case) is the delivery of information students need in a manner that motivates, inspires, and communicates our belief in their capacity. This is important because teachers are often told to use a “praise sandwich” or to praise five times as often as they criticize. But telling someone they're doing great several times so that you can then say *And you have to line up your decimals consistently* is problematic.

Believing that you must wrap criticism with praise assumes that students are fragile and can't take constructive feedback—that criticism is something a teacher has to trick them into hearing. Most students want to understand how to get better and come to trust adults who tell them the truth when they also know that those adults believe in them.

Inaccurate or unwarranted praise “is unlikely to stand for long in the face of contrary experience,” writes Peps Mccrea. “Promises of success that don't eventually materialize will only serve to undermine motivation and erode trust.”

We all know the teacher who's inclined to describe every idea, every answer, every action as “awesome.” Soon

enough that word and his praise more generally become less meaningful. When everything is awesome, nothing is.

Which isn't to say praise isn't profoundly important and motivating. It is. But that's all the more reason to preserve its value.

So the key is often not to praise more. Rather, aspire to give a range of useful and honest feedback and guidance that includes both praise and critical or corrective feedback, but do so positively, *in a manner that motivates, inspires, and communicates our belief in our students' capacity*.

Using *Positive Framing* allows you to give all kinds of feedback, as required by the situation, while keeping culture strong and students motivated. Doubly so for redirections—moments when we say to a student, “Do that differently.” If those moments remind the person you're talking to that you want them to be successful and that you believe in and trust their intentions, students will trust you more and be motivated to follow your guidance.

*Positive Framing*, then, is the technique of framing interactions—particularly academic or behavioral redirections—so that they reinforce a larger picture of faith and trust, even while you remind students of a better course of action.

Next are six rules of thumb to follow. As you read about them, be sure to check out the classroom examples in the video Montage: *Positive Framing*.

their character or personality rather than to the situation. We often assume intentionality behind a mistake.

You can hear this in classrooms where a teacher's words imply that a student did something wrong deliberately when in fact there is little ground to assume that.

“Stop trying to disrupt class!” “Why won't you use the feedback I gave you on your first draft?” or “Just a minute, class; some people seem to think they don't have to push in their chairs when we line up.” Such statements attribute ill intention to what could be the result of distraction, lack of practice, or genuine misunderstanding. What if the student had tried to incorporate your feedback, or just plain forgot about the chair? How might hearing statements like these make a confused or flustered student feel? Unless you have clear evidence that a behavior was intentional, it's better to assume that your students have tried (and will try) to do as you've asked.

This mindset also helps us as teachers maintain our emotional constancy and equilibrium. Rather than feeling flustered or defensive—*Why won't he follow my directions? Is she trying to get under my skin? How many times have I said this?*—assuming the best helps us model calm assurance. This in turn builds trust—students know we will give them the benefit of the doubt and support them through confusion or struggles without jumping to conclusions or taking their actions too personally.

One of the most useful words for assuming the best is *forgot*, as in, “Just a minute; a couple of us seem to have forgotten to push in their chairs. Let's try that again.” Given the benefit of the doubt, your scholars can focus their energy on doing the task right instead of feeling defensive.

Further, this approach shows your students that you assume they want to do well and believe they can—it’s just a matter of nailing down some details.

*Confused* is another good assume-the-best word, as in, “Just a minute; some people appear to be confused about the directions, so let me give them again.” Another approach is to assume that the error is your own: “Just a minute, class; I must not have been clear: I want you to find every verb in the paragraph working silently on your own. Do that now.” This last one is especially useful. It draws students’ attention more directly to your belief that only your own lack of clarity would mean lack of instant follow-through by your focused and diligent charges. And, of course, it also forces you to contemplate that, in fact, you may not have been all that clear.

It is important to note that these phrases will not likely work—nor will this approach—if you do not actually believe the best about the students in front of you. As Adeyemi Stembridge writes, “Authenticity is a must for our students. One of their assets is that they can spot frauds at great distances.” If you are doubtful about student confusion, or worse, if you deliver this observation in a sarcastic tone, then you may actually damage the very relationships that you intend to build up.

Another nice way to assume the best is to see minor struggles as the result of misdirected enthusiasm. When you think this way, you suggest that there was a positive intention for a behavior that merely went awry. In a behavioral situation, this might sound like, “Gentlemen, I appreciate your enthusiasm to get to math class, but we need to walk to the door. Let me see you go back and do it the right way.” In an academic setting, it might sound like, “I appreciate that you are trying to build complex and

expressive sentences, but this one might have a little too much in it for clarity.”

Assuming the best is especially effective for errors on challenging academic work. Learning is full of mistakes done for good reasons. There are those that spring from an overabundance of diligence—“You told me to use transition words so I used far too many”—and those rooted in too much enthusiasm—“I've just learned to reduce fractions and now I want to reduce and reduce and reduce everything … even when I can't.”

Assuming the best might give credit for a good idea and then offer the correction: “I like that you're looking to reduce. But we can't do that here.” Or “I love to see you trying to use those transition words but there are so many they've gotten a bit confusing.” Looking for the good intention behind the mistake, looking to assume the best, has the additional benefit of causing *you* to think about all the good reasons why students might have done something that at first looks egregious. Assuming well-intentioned errors can help you to see more of the positivity that already exists.

It's important to remember that you, too, participate in setting the norms of your classroom by describing what you expect. Assuming the best reinforces positive norms (and expresses a quiet confidence). It suggests that you struggle to imagine a universe in which students would not be productive, considerate, and scholarly because of your faith both in them and in the culture of your own classroom. You implicitly describe the norm you believe to be there—everyone making a good faith effort. If by contrast you were to assume the worst, you would be suggesting that sloppiness, inconsiderateness, and whatever else were what you yourself expected in your classroom.

Of course, you'll want to be careful not to overuse the assume-the-best approach. If a student is clearly struggling—refusing to follow a clearly delivered instruction and is signaling to you that they are in an agitated, emotional state—don't pretend. In such cases, addressing the behavior directly with something more substantive, such as a private individual correction, also helps to get the student back into a productive mode without the attention of the rest of the class.

Even in the most challenging cases, however—say a student has done something really negative like stealing or belittling a classmate—be careful to let your words judge a specific behavior (“That was dishonest”) rather than a person (“You are dishonest”). Perhaps even say, “That was dishonest, but I know that's not who you are.” A person is always more and better than the moments in which he or she errs, and our language choices give us the opportunity to show in those moments that we still see the best in the people around us.

# Live in the Now

In most cases—during class and while your lesson is underway, for example—avoid talking about what went wrong and what students can no longer fix. Talk about what should happen next. Describing what's no longer within your control is negative and demotivating. There's a time and place for processing what went wrong, but the right time is not when your lesson hangs in the balance or when action is required.

When you have to give constructive feedback, start by giving instructions that describe as specifically as possible the next move on the path to success (see *technique 52*, What to Do).

If David is whispering to his neighbor instead of taking notes, say, “I need to see you taking notes, David,” or, better, because it is more specific, “I should see your pencil moving,” rather than, “Stop talking, David,” or “I've told you before to take notes, David.”

In the previous chapter we saw Emily Bisso use this to great effect: “Write what I write, Joshua.”

Again, the clearer you can be about the next step, the better. As Chip and Dan Heath point out in *Switch*, “what looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity.” So provide clarity without judgment. If you deliver the directions in a neutral tone, with no frustration evident in your voice, you may be surprised by how helpful it is. Most students want to succeed; by providing them with a clear next step you are helping both of you to get closer to your shared goal.

One challenge here is that we often are too vague in our instructions. When in doubt, shrink the change—a phrase that also comes from the Heath brothers. “One way to motivate action, then, is to make people feel as though they're already closer to the finish line than they might have thought.” Name a small first step that feels doable. So, “Please start taking notes, David,” becomes “Pencil in hand, please.” It's much easier for a potentially reluctant or confused student to engage in a task that is bite-size than one that might feel more overwhelming.

For what it's worth, this is part of the coaching philosophy of the famously positive and successful football coach Pete Carroll, one of the game's best motivators. “We're really disciplined as coaches to always talk about what we want to see,” he says of his entire coaching staff's approach. They always strive to focus on “the desired outcome, not about what went wrong or what the mistake was. We have to be disciplined and always use our language to talk about

# Allow Plausible Anonymity

You can often allow students the opportunity to strive to reach your expectations in plausible anonymity as long as they are making a good-faith effort. This would mean, as I discuss in *Chapter Eleven*, beginning by correcting them without using their names when possible. If a few students are not yet completely ready to move on with the activities of the class, consider making your first correction something like “Check yourself to make sure you've followed the directions.” In most cases, this will yield results faster than calling out individual students by name. It doesn't feel good to hear your teacher say, “Evan, put down the pencil,” if you knew you were about to do just that. Saying to your class, “Wait a minute, Morehouse (or “Tigers” or “fifth grade” or just “guys”), I hear a few voices still talking. I need to see you quiet and ready to go!” is better than lecturing the talkers in front of the class. This plausible anonymity is another way of communicating to students that you believe the best about their intentions and are certain they are just seconds away from being fully ready to move forward with the tasks necessary to learn.

# Narrate the Positive and Build Momentum

Compare the statements two teachers recently made in their respective classrooms:

I need to see you quiet and ready to go!” is better than lecturing the talkers in front of the class. This plausible anonymity is another way of communicating to students that you believe the best about their intentions and are certain they are just seconds away from being fully ready to move forward with the tasks necessary to learn.

# Narrate the Positive and Build Momentum

Compare the statements two teachers recently made in their respective classrooms:

*Teacher 1: (pausing after giving a direction)* Monique and Emily are there. I see rows three and four are fully prepared. Just need three people. Thank you for fixing that, David. Ah, now we're there, so let's get started.

Teacher 2: (same setting) I need two people paying attention at this table. Some people don't appear to be listening. This table also has some students who are not paying attention to my directions. I'll wait, gentlemen, and if I have to give consequences, I will.

In the first teacher's classroom, things appear to be moving in the right direction because the teacher narrates the evidence of student follow-through, of students doing as they're asked, of things getting done. He calls his students' attention to this fact, thereby normalizing it. He doesn't praise when students do what he asks, but merely acknowledges or describes. He wants them to know he sees it, but he also doesn't want to confuse doing what's expected with doing *great*. If I am sitting in this classroom and seek, as most students do, to be normal, I now sense the normality of positive, on-task behavior and will likely choose to do the same.

The second teacher is telling a different story. Things are going poorly and getting worse. He's doing his best to call our attention to the normality of his being ignored and the fact that this generally occurs without consequence. The second teacher is helping students to see negative norms as they develop and, in broadcasting his anxieties, making them even more visible and prominent as well. In a sense he's creating a self-fulfilling prophecy: he narrates negative behavior into being.

“To modify motivation,” writes Peps Mccrea, “change what … pupils see.” If teachers make *desirable norms* (people doing positive things) more visible to students they will be more likely to join with them. Mccrea calls this *elevating visibility*. To elevate visibility of a norm you want more people to follow, increase their *profusion*—the proportion of students who appear to follow them—and their *prominence*—how much you notice when people do it.

The first teacher is helping students to see more readily how profuse positive and constructive behavior is, and he is making it more prominent to students by letting them know that he sees and that it matters.

Narrating the positive, though useful, is also extremely vulnerable to misapplication, so here are a couple of key rules:

- Use *Narrate the Positive* as a tool to motivate group behavior as students are deciding whether to work to meet expectations, not as a way to correct individual students after they clearly have not met expectations.

- If you narrate positive on-task behavior *during* a countdown you are describing behavior that has exceeded expectations. You gave students ten seconds to get their binders out and be ready to take notes, but Jabari is ready at five seconds. It's fine to call that out. It's very different to call out Jabari for having his binder out after your countdown has ended. At that point it might seem as though you are using Jabari's readiness to plead with others who have not followed through in the time you allotted.

Another common misapplication would be this: You're ready to discuss *Tuck Everlasting*, but Susan is off task, giggling and trying to get Martina's attention. You would not be using positive framing or narrating the positive effectively if you circum-narrated a "praise circle" around Susan: "I see Danni is ready to go. And Elisa. Alexis has her book out." In this case, I recommend that you address Susan directly but positively: "Susan, show me your best, with your notebook out. We've got lots to do." If you use the praise circle, students will be pretty aware of what you're doing and are likely to see your positive reinforcement as contrived and disingenuous. And they're likely to think

you're afraid to just address Susan. In fact, Susan may think that as well. By directly reminding Susan what is expected—and why—you have helped her get ready to engage with the learning and maintained the norm of readiness that is shared by the class.

# Challenge!

Students love to be challenged, to prove they can do things, to compete, to win. So challenge them: exhort them to prove what they can do by building competition into the day. Students can be challenged as individuals or, usually better, as groups, and those groups can compete in various ways:

- Against other groups within the class (e.g. rows, tables)
- Against other groups outside the class (another homeroom)
- Against an impersonal foe (the clock; the test, to prove they're better than it is; their age—“That was acceptable work for seventh graders, but I want to see if we can kick it up to eighth-grade quality.”)
- Against an abstract standard (“I want to see whether you guys have what it takes!”)

Here are some examples to get you started. I'm sure you'll find it fun to think of more:

“You guys have been doing a great job this week. Let's see if you can take it up a notch.”

“I love the work I'm seeing. I wonder what happens when we add in another factor.”

“Let's see if we can write for ten minutes straight without stopping. Ready?!”

"Ms. Austin said she didn't think you guys could knock out your math tables faster than her class. Let's show 'em what we've got."

# Talk Expectations and Aspirations

When you ask students to do something differently or better, you are helping them become the people they wish to be or to achieve enough to have their choice of dreams. You can use the moments where you ask for better work to remind them of this. When you ask your students to revise their thesis paragraphs, tell them you want them to write as though “you're in college already” or that “with one more draft, you'll be on your way to college.” If your students are fourth graders, ask them to try to look as sharp as the fifth graders. Or tell them you want to do one more draft of their work and have them “really use the words of a scientist [or historian, and so on] this time around.” Tell them you want them to listen to each other like Supreme Court Justices. Although it's nice that you're proud of them (and it's certainly wonderful to tell them that), the goal in the end is not for them to please you but for them to leave you behind on a long journey toward a more distant and more important goal. It's useful if your framing connects them to that goal.

## TECHNIQUE 60: PRECISE PRAISE

Whereas *Positive Framing* focuses on how you make constructive or critical feedback feel motivating, caring, and purposeful to the recipient, *Precise Praise* is about managing positive feedback to maximize its focus, benefit, and credibility. Although it might seem like the simplest thing in the world, positive reinforcement helps students more if it's intentional, and you must constantly defend against the potential for it to become empty or

disingenuous, especially through overuse. When we over-rely on “excellent” and “awesome” to stamp every interaction we have with a child—what I sometimes call the state of “awesome awesomeness”—we eliminate our ability to truly and genuinely celebrate the accomplishments that are indeed *excellent* and *awesome* when they really do occur.

# Reinforce Actions, Not Traits

Positive reinforcement is a response to an action that has just occurred: a student does something well, and you tell her she's done a nice job. At its best, positive reinforcement is also about the future. You don't just want a student to feel good about having done something correctly, you want to help her understand how to succeed again the next time. Even more deeply, you want to reinforce a way of thinking about learning that embraces struggle and adversity—relishes it even. Carol Dweck's seminal research on this topic, discussed in her book *Mindset*, has shown that in the long run, people who have a growth mindset far outpace those with a fixed mindset. Her research suggests that the difference is one of the strongest predictors of success. People with a fixed mindset see intelligence and skill as something static. You're smart, or you're not. You're good at something, or you're not. People with a growth mindset see intelligence and skill as something you develop. You work hard, and you get better. Smart isn't what you are; it's what you do. Individuals with a fixed mindset see a challenge and think, “Oh, no. This is going to be difficult.” Individuals with a growth mindset see a challenge and think, “Oh, boy. This is going to be difficult.”

Dweck finds that praise is central to the development of growth mindset. If students are praised for traits (“You're smart”), they become risk averse: they worry that if they fail, they won't be smart anymore. If students are praised

for actions (“You worked hard, and look!”), they become risk tolerant because they understand that the things within their control—their actions—determine results. It’s critical then to praise actions, not traits, and further to carefully identify actions that students can replicate. You are praising them in part to help them see the inside of the success machine: the more actionable the thing you reinforce, the more students can replicate their success. “Go back and look at your draft, Maria. See those cross-outs and rewrites? That’s why your final draft is so strong.” You can see this in the video *Steve Chiger: Kudos*, of North Star Academy English teacher Steve Chiger. At first Steve walks up to a student and tells her she’s done well. We pause the video here to let you reflect: What’s her takeaway? What does she conclude about her success? She knows Mr. Chiger thinks she did something great, but not what and why. Not how to do it again. Perhaps his praise made her feel good, but with so many questions maybe it doesn’t quite feel genuine.

But then it’s as if Steve recognizes this. He doubles back and answers all of those questions. The student realizes I was sharp in class because I prepped well and read carefully and made notes. I can do that again.

Suddenly the praise has taken on a whole new role. She can see the road map that was hidden before. He has helped her to see what has caused her success and what to keep doing.

Of course, praising (or positively reinforcing) actions means calling out things like hard work and diligence, but some of the best teachers I've observed align their praise to learning objectives. Suppose students are working on including strong transitions in their writing. As you *Circulate* (technique 25) and observe, you specifically reinforce those who have used transitions or, better, those who have gone back and added to or revised their transitions to make them better. Perhaps you even use a *Show Call* (technique 13) to show off their work. “Scholars, look up here. This is Melanie’s paper. Look at this paragraph. She included a solid transition, but then she went back and revised it to make it capture the contrast between the paragraphs more clearly. Now her paper really holds together. That’s how you do it.” Now, not only does Melanie know what was behind her success, not only does she understand that success is determined directly by her own actions, but the rest of the class sees it, too.

Another benefit of *Precise Praise* connects back to what Shawn Anchor calls the *Tetris Effect*. Essentially, by training our brains to look for and appreciate the positive, we learn to see things more positively overall. Anchor writes, “Just as it takes days of concentrated practice to master a video game, training your brain to notice more opportunities takes practice focusing on the positive.” By using *Precise Praise* to help students notice all that they are doing that is right or exceptional, we are also training them to see the learning community as a positive place. We are also, of course, training ourselves to see the same. Imagine the effect that this habit has on the struggling first-year teacher, in the classroom where everything may not be exactly as she or he had hoped. By training herself to precisely name that which is going well, she not only makes that behavior more replicable for students, but lets herself celebrate that which is worthy—and hopefully avoids the

doom loop of narration that can overwhelm so many well-intended, early-career teachers.

# Differentiate Acknowledgment from Praise

Acknowledgment is what you often use when a student meets your expectations. Praise is what you use when a student exceeds expectations. An acknowledgment merely describes a productive behavior or perhaps thanks a student for doing it, without adding a value judgment and with a modulated tone. Praise adds judgment words like “great” or “fantastic” or the kind of enthusiastic tone that implies that such words might apply. “Thanks for that comment, Marcus” is an acknowledgment; “Fantastic insight, Marcus” is praise. “Marcus is ready” is acknowledgment; “Great job, Marcus” is praise.

Distinguishing the two is important, as reversing some of the examples will demonstrate. If I tell Marcus it's fantastic that he's ready for class, I suggest that this is more than I expect from my students. Ironically, in praising this behavior I tell my students that my standards are pretty low and that perhaps I am a bit surprised that Marcus met my expectations. Perhaps they aren't expectations after all. Either way, praising students for merely meeting expectations may reduce the degree to which they do so over the long run. It also makes your praise seem “cheap.” If that happens, it also means that when Marcus writes a powerful response to a piece of literature and you call it “fantastic,” you will be describing it in a manner on par with how you described coming to class on time, and this may perversely diminish the accomplishment in his eyes. In the long run, a teacher who continually praises what's expected risks trivializing both the praise and the things she really wishes to label “great,” eroding the ability to give meaningful verbal rewards and to identify behavior that is truly worthy of notice. In short, save your praise for

knowing that listening in might provide them with the juicy details of a classmate's misfortune. Most people can't help but be curious about such things. If, however, my approaching or leaning down to speak quietly with a student is just as likely to be an example of private individual precise praise (PIPP, also discussed in Chapter Eleven), then students will consider the approach with balanced equanimity, and their classmates will have no incentive to eavesdrop. Either message is thus heard more openly by the intended recipient and ignored by those for whom it's not intended.

That said, there are also benefits to loud praise and praise that's semiprivate—that is, deliberately intended to be overheard by others. Praise always walks the line between the benefit of allowing others to overhear what's praiseworthy and thus encouraging them to seek to emulate it, and the benefit of the genuine sincerity of its just being about the recipient. In terms of how to balance these benefits, my sense is that both are more powerful if they aren't entirely predictable and that although socializing and influencing others through praise are beneficial, they're less critical than the long-term benefit of maintaining the credibility and genuineness of praise. I would skew toward privacy a bit more for the most substantive feedback to a student.

# TECHNIQUE 61: WARM/STRICT

In *Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain*, Zaretta Hammond describes the critical importance of teachers who are what she calls “warm demanders”: those who combine personal warmth with high expectations and “active demandingness,” which, she writes, “isn't defined as just a no-nonsense firmness with regard to behavior but an insistence on excellence and academic effort.”
