*find out how they are doing.* Hopefully in the aggregate that consciousness can be curative.

The video *Gabby Woolf: Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde* shows an interesting adaptation of *Replace Self-Report*. If you're not familiar with it, Robert Louis Stevenson's novella is a challenging read. For example, the passage Gabby was reading with her Year 10 class at London's King Solomon Academy begins: “Nearly a year later, in the month of October, 18—, London was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling.”

Gabby and her students read the passage aloud—you can hear them doing a lovely job reading it via FASE Reading in the clip *Gabby Woolf: Keystone*—and because of its complexity, Gabby paused after reading and told the class she wanted to “check that you understand.” She then projected a series of short targeted questions on the board and gave students a minute or so to review the answers in pairs. The questions were straightforward and designed to yield short answers that revealed student understanding (or the lack of it) quickly:

- “What month did the murder take place in?”
- “Why was London particularly startled by the victim?”
- “Who saw the murder?”
- “Where did she see the murder from?
- “Who is the murderer?”

Gabby wanted to ensure that despite archaic syntax such as “singular ferocity” and “rendered all the more notable” they had grasped the critical details of what had taken place.
