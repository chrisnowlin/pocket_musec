# Chapter 10 Procedures and Routines

I wish everyone could have seen Sam DeLuke and Meghan Hurley's second-grade classroom at Troy Prep Elementary School on the day I visited recently. When I first walked in, I found Sam sitting in one corner, listening in on five students discussing a chapter book. As I inched closer, I overheard students making sophisticated statements like “I think you missed one piece of evidence, Zariah” and “I agree with David's point and want to develop it” (see technique 44, *Habits of Discussion*). In another corner, Meghan read a book about ants aloud to ten students who hung on every word. In the center of the room, six students sat engrossed in the pages of their independent reading, while another group had hunkered down to draft paragraphs explaining the theme of a story they had read.

A few minutes later, on Sam's cue, one of the groups from the center put their things away, stood, and walked quietly to Meghan's corner. Others, who did not transition, kept working away. Later, with a subtle gesture and without ever interrupting her instruction, she prompted a student to distribute books to peers who didn't have them.

Students in Sam and Meghan's class worked in an atmosphere of independence and self-management. Executive function is usually described as including the following sorts of skills:

- Paying attention
- Organizing, planning, and prioritizing
- Starting tasks and staying focused on them to completion
