retrieval, even those whom you don't call on. You can also use *Everybody Writes* and other forms of writing to cause student thinking to be more durably encoded in memory. Remember that thinking hard about things encodes them in memory. A good adage to remember is that students remember what they think about, so get the ratio high and build habits of attention and focus. Constantly have an eye to building knowledge (knowledge organizers can be helpful) and reinforce reading fluency with *FASE Reading*.

But also don't forget your own working memory. **Chapter Two** will help you use lesson preparation to free it for perceiving what's happening with students while you teach. When gathering data on student mastery, remember that the data can quickly overload your working memory so track it via *Active Observation*.
