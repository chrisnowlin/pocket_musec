standards high but he also makes it safe to struggle (“We’ll work through it; we’ll problem-solve together”). And then he immediately begins practicing what he preaches so players understand that he means it because they start building the habit right away.

In fact a second video of James, *James Beeston: How Can We Use This?*, shows him questioning his players a bit later (after they’ve practiced for 20 minutes or so). From a ratio perspective—how many participants think about his questions, how much of the time, and how deeply—it would be hard to do much better.

Sadie had a very similar rollout on her first day to set up her default. Then she layered in new routines and their cues using a chart like the following one, which captures some of the common routines students use to participate in class, the cues a teacher might use to signal them and some other factors to consider.

| **MOP** | **Expectations** | **CUE** | **Notes** |
|---------|------------------|---------|---------|
| *Cold Call* (or Volunteers) | Raise your hand. I may call on hands or may *Cold Call*. | Default "I’ll ask some of you to share" or "Be ready, I may *Cold Call*" to increase predictability. | Explain to students that if you don’t signal anything else it means (1) raise your hand, (2) do not call out, (3) be ready for a *Cold Call*. |
| Volunteers (only) | I am looking to only call on volunteers, but I want lots of them. | "Hands!" "Your turn." Nonverbal: teacher raises hand as she asks. | Have a reminder ready if there are call outs (nonverbal or "Hands, please"). |
