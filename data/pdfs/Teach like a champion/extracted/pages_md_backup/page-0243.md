many of you have your hands in the air,” or you can shorthand that by simply referring to your students' “brave hands” when you see them raised (for example, “Who wants to take a shot at our challenge question? Beautiful. Love those brave hands … Diallo, what do you think?”). If discussing a particularly difficult passage in a book, you could try acknowledging the difficulty by saying something like, “This is a question that people have debated for decades, but you're really attacking this.” You can see Denarius Frazier do this in the *Culture of Error* montage. “Ohhh, I like this bravery,” he says, looking out at a handful of students willing to try to answer a difficult question. In a *Culture of Error*, students should feel good about stepping out on a limb, whether they're right or wrong.
