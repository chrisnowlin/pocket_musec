Finally, a closer look at the factors that contribute to positive and safe common school areas (see Chapter 6) reveals that both students and teachers need to understand how to create and sustain these positive school settings and learn how to respond to different intensity levels of TTBHHPA which, as noted above, occur most often in these common school areas. Once again, the presence of these processes in a school’s crisis management or Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) and the training and discussions related to that plan communicate to everyone that prosocial behaviors are expected and will be reinforced, and that there will be consequences and accountability for acts of TTBHHPA. This message is especially powerful when it is communicated, highlighted, and owned by the students across their various peer groups.

While Chapter 6’s setting-specific discussion of the first five special situation domains is easily adapted to the TTBHHPA student-specific context here, some additional prevention activities within the peer group domain are recommended. For example, staff and students need to

* Understand the similarities and differences across the different cohorts and peer groups in the school so that (as developmentally appropriate) discussions within and across these peer groups can be facilitated about issues of communication and collaboration, tolerance and individual differences, and conflict prevention and resolution as they especially relate to TTBHHPA. These discussions could focus on how student differences or stereotypes (e.g., involving gender, socioeconomic status, race and culture, academic proficiency, extracurricular activities) sometimes contribute to TTBHHPA, and how everyone needs to understand, tolerate, and celebrate these differences and diversities.
* Understand the short-term, long-term, and generational (if present) student, peer, school, and community TTBHHPA histories among different peer groups as students enter each school year, and how to strengthen positive student interactions and prevent (continued) negative interactions. This is particularly important as students from different elementary schools merge into single middle schools and students from different middle schools merge into single high schools.
* Organize and empower different student groups across the school (e.g., student government leaders, athletes, performing arts students at the
