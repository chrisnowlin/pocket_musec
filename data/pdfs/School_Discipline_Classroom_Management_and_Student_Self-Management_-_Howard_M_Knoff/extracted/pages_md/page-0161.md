using specific social skills and to learn, master, and use their prosocial skills at more automatic and independent levels over time. In summary,

When teaching and modeling, teachers need to make sure that students
- have the prerequisite skills to be successful,
- are taught using language that they can understand,
- are taught in simple steps that ensure success, and
- hear the social skills script as the social skills behavior is demonstrated.

When practicing or role-playing, teachers need to make sure that students
- verbalize (or repeat or hear) the steps to a particular social skill as they demonstrate its appropriate behavior,
- practice only the positive or appropriate social skill behavior,
- receive ongoing and consistent practice opportunities,
- use relevant practice situations that simulate the emotional intensity of the real situations so that they can fully master their social skills and be able to demonstrate them under conditions of emotionality, and
- practice the skills at a developmental level that they can handle.

When giving performance feedback, teachers need to make sure that the feedback is
- specific and descriptive,
- focused on reinforcing students’ successful use of the social skill, or on correcting an inaccurate or incomplete social skills demonstration, and
- positive—emphasizing what was done well and what can be done well (or better) next time.

When transferring or applying social skills after instruction, teachers need to make sure that they reinforce students’ prosocial skills steps and behavior when students
- have successfully demonstrated an appropriate social skill,
- have made a bad choice, demonstrating an inappropriate social skill,
