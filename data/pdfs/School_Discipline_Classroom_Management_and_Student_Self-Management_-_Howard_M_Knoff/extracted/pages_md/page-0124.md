# PREPLANNING: AT THE SCHOOL DISCIPLINE/PBSS COMMITTEE

Initially, the school discipline/PBSS committee is trained in the matrix development process, the use of the forms needed to develop a grade-level matrix, and the information relevant to developing expectations for the common areas of the school (Knoff, 2007c). Knowing that the matrix development process takes from six to twelve weeks (in order to be realistic given other meetings and activities planned and needed across the school), the committee and the school’s administration agree on a schedule to complete the six phases outlined above. The above time frame is suggested because the development of the matrix requires a series of group meetings, in-depth discussions, and consensus-building processes that are better accomplished through a series of shorter meetings than through a single daylong professional development session. (When the latter is used, the process of facilitating staff consensus and consistency often is sacrificed for the completion of the forms and the matrix itself.) This results in a lack of commitment and consistency when implementing the final product. Typically, behavioral matrices can be developed and implemented at any time of the year as long as there are realistic goals and expectations when they are implemented at Phase 6.

Below is a chart with two sample matrix development schedules, one starting at the beginning of the school year and another starting in the middle. Typically, the rationale for the development of the matrix and the schedule with the goals and objectives for each phase is presented at a faculty meeting or a series of grade-level team meetings. At times, one or more samples of a Behavioral Matrix are provided so that staff members have a clear picture of the final result.
