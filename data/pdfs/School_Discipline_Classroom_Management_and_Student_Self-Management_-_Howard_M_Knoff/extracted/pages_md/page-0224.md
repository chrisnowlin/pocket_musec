where the victim got him or her into trouble at school or at home. A group of negative bystanders may be motivated because they represent a gang that is in conflict with the gang represented by the victims. During a TTBHHPA incident, an uninvolved bystander may be motivated, for example, by the fear of recriminations from either the bully or the negative bystanders or because there are insufficient school or adult incentives to get involved or consequences if they remain uninvolved.

In the end, the Special Situation Analysis needs to consider the impact of competing or conflicting motivational and accountability dynamics across the four student groups described. Whether on an individual or group basis, if these dynamics are present, the intervention plan needs to address them by unpacking the conflicting dynamics (e.g., where recriminations from the negative bystanders for trying to stop a TTBHHPA incident are more compelling than the incentives from the adults for getting involved), and repacking the dynamics so that they are positive, consistent, and reinforced across all of the groups involved.

**Consistency.** Relative to the consistency, students may be TTBHHPA aggressors (or aggressor-victims), victims, or negatively contributing or uninvolved bystanders when the expectations, instruction, incentives and consequences, or accountability responses that encourage prosocial interactions and discourage TTBHHPA interactions are inconsistent across people, time, situations, settings, and circumstances. When inconsistency occurs,

- TTBHHPA occurs more in the settings where the expectations appear to allow these incidents,
- students who have learned effective avoidance and response skills are victimized less than those who have not been taught these skills,
- negative student bystanders become more active when there are no consequences for their inappropriate behavior, and
- uninvolved student bystanders remain inactive when they know they will not be held accountable by other peers or adults.

Critically, inconsistency can occur at a student, peer group, or staff level in a school, it might involve mixed or contradictory messages across
