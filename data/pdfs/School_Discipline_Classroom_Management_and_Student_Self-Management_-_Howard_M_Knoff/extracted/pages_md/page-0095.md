As outlined in Chapter 2 and described in greater detail in this chapter’s Appendix 1, there are a number of critical schoolwide activities that the school discipline/PBSS committee oversees on an ongoing basis. These include (a) the school’s social climate and staff-student connectedness, interactions, and engagement; (b) the implementation of the social, emotional, and behavioral skills program (which may include the health, mental health, and wellness program at the secondary level); (c) the implementation of the Behavioral Matrix and the student accountability system; (d) attention to incidents of teasing, taunting, bullying, harassment, hazing, and fighting, and staff-student interactions in the common areas of the school; (e) attention to school safety and crisis prevention and readiness; (f) the involvement of the school’s support staff (e.g., custodians, cafeteria workers, secretaries, bus drivers); (g) collaboration with other school-level committees, and grade-level or instructional teams; (h) collaboration with parents, community agencies, and other community leaders in a collaborative effort to extend its activities and outcomes to home and community; and (i) the evaluation of all of these activities.

In a parallel fashion, grade-level teams (at the elementary level) and instructional teams (at the secondary level) should meet (once per month is strongly recommended) to discuss the implementation of the PBSS at their levels. Guided by their representative(s) to the school discipline/PBSS committee, these teams should discuss the implementation of the activities above that are relevant to their classrooms and students. Once again, the shared leadership and representational governance processes inherent in the effective school and schooling and committee blueprint allows for seamless planning, implementation, discussion, and decision-making. This collaboration occurs from the school discipline/PBSS committee down to the grade or instructional teams and from these teams up to the committee level.

# SUMMARY

This chapter uses the effective schools blueprint from Chapter 1 to recommend and describe a school committee structure, focusing eventually on the two committees that most directly guide the PBSS: the school discipline/PBSS committee and the building-level SPRINT team. After the
