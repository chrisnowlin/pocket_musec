As reflected above, the service delivery approaches embedded in the RTI² process involve problem solving, consultation, and intervention. Below, the data-based, functional assessment problem-solving process is described in more detail.

## THE DATA-BASED, FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT, PROBLEM-SOLVING PROCESS

Data-based problem solving is the hub that connects all of the spokes of the RTI² process, and it is vital that all instructional, related services and support, and administrative staff in a school are collaboratively trained and competent in its implementation. While somewhat sequential, data-based problem solving is still a fluid, flexible, and strategic process involving four inherent elements: (a) problem identification, clarification, and specification; (b) problem analysis and functional assessment; (c) intervention planning, preparation, and implementation; and (d) evaluation of implementation integrity, intensity, and success. These essential elements are expanded into seven interdependent steps below.

### Step 1: Reviewing Existing Data, Records, and Student History

When a teacher has concerns about a student’s social, emotional, or behavioral progress or status, the first formal steps in the RTI² process include

- examining all of the existing cumulative, attendance, assessment, and intervention records on the student that are present in or available to the school, and documenting all essential information;
- determining, with help if needed, the student’s current functional skill level in all academic and behavioral areas, and how much progress the student has made on an annual basis;
- ensuring that the student’s hearing and vision, at the very least, have been checked and approved by the school nurse, while collecting any
