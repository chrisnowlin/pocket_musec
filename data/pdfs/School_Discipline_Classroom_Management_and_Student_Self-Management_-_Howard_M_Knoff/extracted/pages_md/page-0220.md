Thus, this chapter and section focuses on the student and peer group domains and on understanding and intervening with those whom we will now call the aggressors (or aggressor-victims), the victims, and the negatively contributing or uninvolved bystanders.

From a research and problem-solving perspective, there are numerous reasons why some students are TTBHHPA aggressors (or aggressor-victims), victims, or negatively contributing or uninvolved bystanders—both on an individual and on a group level. We have organized these student-specific reasons throughout this book along a skills, motivation and accountability, and consistency continuum and will use that same functional structure here.

**Skills.** Relative to skills, TTBHHPA aggressors and negative bystanders are most often involved in their respective activities because they have not learned or mastered relationship skills, emotional control skills, or consequence and response skills. Consistent with the research summarized above (e.g., Cook et al., 2010), examples of these skill gaps or skill deficits include the following:

1. **Relationship Skills:**  
   Listening or following directions  
   Asking for help  
   Ignoring (distractions)  
   Apologizing  
   Dealing with peer pressure  
   Beginning and ending a conversation  
   Giving and accepting a compliment  
   Being a good leader  

2. **Emotional Control Skills:**  
   Setting a goal  
   Evaluating yourself  
   Understanding your feelings  
   Understanding others’ feelings  
   Dealing with anger  
   Walking away from a fight  
   Standing up for your rights  
   Avoiding trouble  

3. **Consequence/Response Skills:**  
   Dealing with consequences  
   Dealing with teasing, being rejected, or being left out  
   Dealing with peer pressure
