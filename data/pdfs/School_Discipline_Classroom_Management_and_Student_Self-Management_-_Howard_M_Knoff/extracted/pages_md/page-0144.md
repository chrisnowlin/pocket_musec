for all students. Moreover, by publicizing, teaching, and holding both students and staff members to these standards (academically through state standards and scope and sequence benchmarks; behaviorally through the Behavioral Matrix), the vast majority of students are successful. Ultimately, the questions for schools and staff are: “Do you have a clear, developmentally appropriate set of explicit behavioral standards?” and “Does your faculty make comparable academic and behavioral efforts to help all students meet the stated competencies in both areas?” With the Behavioral Matrix, the answer to both of these questions should be “Yes.”
