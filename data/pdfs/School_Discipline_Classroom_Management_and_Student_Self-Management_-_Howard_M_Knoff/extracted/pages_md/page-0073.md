**Action 2.1: Schoolwide SPRINT Training.** In January, a third schoolwide in-service is provided on the data-based functional assessment problem-solving process that teaches staff members how to functionally and behaviorally analyze students who are not responding to the preventive aspects of the PBSS system and who are presenting with more resistant or challenging behavior.

**Action 2.2: Grade-Level SPRINT Practice.** Once the Action 2.1 training has been completed, grade-level teams meet at least monthly to use and practice the data-based functional assessment problem-solving process, applying it to cases involving individual or groups of students presenting with challenging behaviors. These meetings are facilitated by a representative of the building-level SPRINT team (e.g., the school psychologist, social worker, school counselor, or special education teacher) so that the problem-solving process is practiced and used with integrity. This helps to establish the grade-level SPRINT process (see Chapter 3) that becomes a routine part of the monthly grade-level meetings in the school.

**Action 2.3: Formal Special Situations Analysis Training for the School Discipline/PBSS Committee.** If it has not yet taken place, the school discipline/PBSS committee is formally trained in how to conduct special situation analyses and develop special situation intervention plans based on their results.

**Action 2.4: Extended Social, Emotional, and Behavioral Intervention Training for Selected Staff Members.** During the course of this semester (or school year), and based on the results of the behavioral intervention survey (and other tools), selected staff members participate in strategic and intensive training in specific social, emotional, and behavioral intervention areas. For example, selected members of the school discipline/PBSS committee may receive more specialized training in Tier 1 and 2 (see Chapter 1 and 9) interventions, while members of the building-level SPRINT team may receive more specialized training in Tier 2 and 3 interventions.

**Action 2.5: End-of-Year Articulation Activities.** At the end of the school year, the school discipline/PBSS committee, along with all other staff, committees, and administrators, complete the PBSS-relevant articulation
