scientific principles, the goals, and the six evidence-based components of the PBSS. The chapter concludes with a brief outline of the multi-tiered RTI² continuum to address the strategic and intensive needs of at-risk, underachieving, unresponsive, or unsuccessful students. Throughout this chapter, the ultimate goal of a PBSS is emphasized—for all students to consistently learn, master, and apply the skills needed for social, emotional, and behavioral competency and self-management in school (and other) settings. The remainder of this book addresses how to plan and implement the six PBSS components and what to do when students do not respond or respond in inappropriate or even extreme ways.
