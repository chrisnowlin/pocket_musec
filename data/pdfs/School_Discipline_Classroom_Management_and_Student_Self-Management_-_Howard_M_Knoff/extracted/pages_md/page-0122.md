(b) related ways to de-escalate or resolve these situations, without physical aggression, if the issues or a confrontation begin again. These interventions hold the students accountable for their inappropriate behavior, increase the probability that the situation has been resolved prior to the end of the suspension, and increase the probability that future appropriate behavior will prevail.

In the end, while the code of conduct may limit their responses to some Intensity IV offenses, administrators still can accomplish the PBSS goals of holding students accountable for their behavior and facilitating their self-management. This begins when they recognize that most suspensions will not change a student’s future behavior, and they initiate the SPRINT process as an inherent part of the suspension decision.

## DEVELOPING THE BEHAVIORAL MATRIX

Across a school, the development of each respective grade-level Behavioral Matrix is guided by the grade-level representative(s) who is a member of the school discipline/PBSS committee (see Chapter 3). Because this committee has at least one representative from each grade level, there is a seamless communication and collaboration link between the committee trained to oversee the entire schoolwide accountability system and the school’s grade-level teams responsible for establishing and implementing student-specific accountability processes. Indeed, after training, the grade-level representatives are expected to guide the activities within the different stages of matrix development at both the committee (school) and grade levels. In all, the development and implementation of the behavioral matrices typically occur in six phases (Knoff, 2007c):

Phase 1: At the grade-level teams
- Completion of the first draft of the Behavioral Matrix by each grade-level team

Phase 2: At the school discipline/PBSS committee
