and behavioral interventions, to the greatest extent possible, in all general education classrooms.

In addition, by the beginning of Implementation Year 2, school discipline/PBSS committee meetings should be occurring monthly, complemented by at least one grade-level meeting per month (at each grade level) focusing on PBSS goals and activities. At this point (if not before), grade-level teams should be receiving monthly reports that give them differentiated data relative to their social skill and other outcomes, including the number of office discipline referrals that occurred the previous month compared with data from the same month during previous years. Using these data, teams can compare and contrast each year’s students and track their ongoing progress. Grade-level teams also can use their meeting times to problem solve more complex or resistant individual student or group discipline or behavior management problems using the data-based functional assessment process.

Concurrent with these and other relevant activities described in the first two PBSS years above, the school discipline/PBSS committee continues to implement, evaluate, and extend their PBSS activities in the following areas: (a) helping to develop, implement, and periodically review the classroom-, grade-level, and buildingwide accountability process; (b) fine-tuning the data management system and determining the need for additional social skills, time-out, or behavioral intervention training for the staff; (c) tracking the use of the social skills process by secretaries, aides, cafeteria workers, and custodians; (d) upgrading (as needed) the building’s prevention, intervention, and crisis management and response plans and processes; and (e) extending PBSS training and implementation into home and community settings.

## Implementation Year 2 Activities

**Action 1.1: Boosters Sessions for Previously Trained Staff on PBSS Components.** During the staff preparation days prior to the new school year and during the first month of school (as needed), booster in-service, consultation, and technical assistance sessions for all continuing staff occurs in the PBSS’s social skills, time-out, data-based problem solving, and other classroom implementation components, skills, and activities.
