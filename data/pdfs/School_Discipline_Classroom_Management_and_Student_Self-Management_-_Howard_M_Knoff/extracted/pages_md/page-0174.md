Think neighborhoods and communities. Working with parents, the leadership councils from the local public housing complexes, the business community, and other agencies and support groups, a safe community and safe school partnership was created to benefit all of the students attending Cleveland Elementary.

Recognizing that school reform often takes up to five years to accomplish, the outcome data from the initiative were analyzed by clustering the first five years (1993 to 1998) of Project ACHIEVE implementation together and then comparing them to the last two years (1998 to 2000) of continued implementation. The results were notable:

## Behavioral Outcomes

- Total discipline referrals to the principal’s office dropped from an average of 45.0 referrals per 100 students for the two years prior to project implementation, to 34.5 referrals per 100 students for the next five years (approximately one referral per school day over an entire year), to 21.3 referrals per 100 students for the last two years (approximately one referral every two school days over the year).
- In-school suspensions dropped from an average of 21.0 suspensions per 100 students for the two years prior to project implementation to 16.4 suspensions per 100 students for the next five years to 11.0 suspensions per 100 students for the last two years.
- Out-of-school suspensions dropped from an average of 5.9 suspensions per 100 students for the two years prior to project implementation to 4.3 suspensions per 100 students for the next five years to 1.8 suspensions per 100 students for the last two years.

## Academic Outcomes

- Grades 2 through 5 students taking the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT-8) reading section between 1993 and 1995 scored, on average, at the 22nd percentile; the Grades 2 through 5 students taking the SAT-9 from 1995 to 1999 had a median percentile rank at the 43rd percentile—indicating significant academic improvements.
