# Sample Worksheet 1B: Intensity II Behaviors and Consequences

Grade Level ________________

**Directions:** Teachers should check off the behaviors below that they feel represent Intensity II behaviors for students at their age or grade level (feel free to add to this list as needed). They then should check off the relevant research- or evidence-based consequences that are known to work with these behaviors and add their own teacher-tested responses or consequences as appropriate. In general, teachers will strategically choose those consequences that have the higher probability of decreasing or eliminating the Intensity II behavior.

**Intensity II (Disruptive or Interfering) Behavior:** Behavior problems in the classroom that teachers handle with a more directed intervention (loss of student points or privileges, a classroom time-out, a note or call home, completion by the student of a behavior action plan).
