entire procedure before the intervention is implemented, the time-out is delivered in a predictable and matter-of-fact manner when needed, the student is required to positively practice the replacement behavior after the time-out is served, and the student knows that continued inappropriate behavior in time-out will result in additional consequences (and levels of time-out). All of this focuses the responsibility for inappropriate and appropriate behavior on the student. Moreover, when implemented with integrity and intensity, a student’s response to this intervention provides a good test of his or her potential for, or resistance to, change.

## STRATEGIC SPECIAL SITUATION INTERVENTIONS AT THE TIER 2 LEVEL

The last set of Tier 2 interventions (see Figure 9.1 once again) involve strategic interventions needed by individual students to address their social, emotional, or behavioral actions, reactions, or interactions (a) in the common areas of a school; (b) due to or involving their own teasing, taunting, bullying, harassment, hazing, and physical aggression; or (c) that relate to current or past life events or crises, traumatic experiences, or physical or emotional conditions (e.g., parents’ divorce, the loss of a parent or sibling, being homeless or adopted, physical or sexual abuse, having a disability). Many of these interventions involve cognitive-behavioral interventions or therapies that are delivered by mental health practitioners (usually psychologists) in individual or small group settings as part of a more comprehensive treatment plan. The goal of these interventions is to change the social, emotional, or behavioral feelings, thoughts, beliefs, expectations, attributions, reactions, and interactions that relate to a student’s inappropriate or maladaptive response to one or more of the three special situations described above. These interventions might also focus on helping students to resolve issues related to anger or emotional control, loss or grief, need for control or feelings of powerlessness, social inhibition or low self-esteem, anxiety or fear, or posttraumatic stress syndrome.

As the functional analysis results link to a student’s intervention needs and desired outcomes, it is essential to note that putting students into counseling or cognitive-behavioral therapy groups or sending them to a
