To summarize, based on completed special situation analyses, TTBHHPA interventions may target (a) students, negatively involved or uninvolved peers, and victims; (b) staff, parents, or others outside of the school; (c) specific school settings, situations, degrees of supervision, or other logistical circumstances; (d) student, peer group, staff, parental, or community incentives or consequences; and (e) the lack of or the use of existing resources. Intervention may focus on students who have previously exhibited TTBHHPA behavior or who demonstrate a high probability of engaging in such behaviors; students who are victimized due to behaviors that trigger TTBHHPA or to behavioral responses (or the lack of effective responses) that reinforce TTBHHPA; peer groups that facilitate, support, or reinforce these students’ inappropriate (or appropriate) behavior; school settings where these acts most frequently occur; and parents whose children and adolescents are directly or indirectly involved. These interventions also may target those students who have previously been involved in TTBHHPA, teaching them successful ways to avoid these situations in the future, and how to respond if the conditions reoccur. Finally, these interventions may include other adults in the school, helping them to successfully recognize and respond to TTBHHPA incidents, or motivating them and holding them accountable for these responses now and in the future.
