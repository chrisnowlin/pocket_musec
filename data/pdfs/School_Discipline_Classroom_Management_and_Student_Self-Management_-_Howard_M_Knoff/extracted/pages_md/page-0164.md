modified and adapted to students who learn in different ways, and they include practical skills that help students to succeed in both classroom and school settings. Finally, a social skills program should include skills that students can use to prevent or respond to situations involving teasing, taunting, bullying, harassment, hazing, and physical aggression.

## A BRIEF REVIEW OF SOME NOTABLE SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL, AND BEHAVIORAL SKILLS PROGRAMS

There are literally hundreds of social, emotional, and behavioral skill programs or curricula on the market today, and yet the vast majority of them are not evidence-based. An evidence-based program has (a) demonstrated consistent positive, data-based outcomes across multiple settings, students, circumstances, implementations, and implementers; (b) demonstrated its effectiveness under controlled and comparison conditions; and (c) been externally and independently evaluated by an expert panel that typically is convened by a federal agency or its designee. Some non-evidence-based programs identify themselves as research-based, but there are no set criteria as to what represents quality research, and anyone can claim that their research is sound and that it validates their program. Indeed, some programs do not acknowledge that their research was conducted by the program’s developer using small, unrepresentative, non-randomly selected samples of convenience, and that their outcomes were not blindly and independently evaluated by outside experts using objective criteria.

A review of existing evidence-based or well-researched social, emotional, or behavioral skills programs (Arkansas Department of Education, 2009) identified eight published programs that meet most, if not all, of the scientific criteria discussed earlier in this chapter: Lion’s Quest, Positive Action, Second Step, Providing Alternative Thinking Strategies, Life Skills Training, Boys Town, Skillstreaming, and the Stop & Think Social Skills Program. Six of these programs are listed on the National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices (NREPP) website sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (U.S.
