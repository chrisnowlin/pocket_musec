The building-level RTI^2 team is staffed with the best academic and behavioral intervention specialists in or available to the school, resulting in more multidisciplinary problem solving and consultation. This team is important because some students are so complex or present such unique or intense challenges that multi- or cross-disciplinary assessment processes and instructional or intervention perspectives are needed to best understand and then address their needs.

Finally, this effective school and schooling component organizes instructional and intervention services, supports, strategies, and programs along a primary (whole school), secondary (strategic intervention), and tertiary (intensive need or crisis management) continuum to address the academic and behavioral needs of all students—including those who are at risk, underachieving, unresponsive, or unsuccessful. Critically, the foundation to the entire RTI^2 process is an effective classroom taught by a highly qualified teacher who uses effective instruction and classroom management techniques. Beyond that, the tiers of the multi-tiered model reflect the intensity of the services and supports needed by students—not where specific interventions are delivered (e.g., inside or outside a general education classroom) or how many students (e.g., all, some, or few) are receiving them (Knoff, Haley, & Gonzales, 2011).
