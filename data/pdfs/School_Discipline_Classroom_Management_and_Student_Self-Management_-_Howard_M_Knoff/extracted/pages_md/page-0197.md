problem analysis process here specifically focuses on whether the problem relates to a lack of needed resources. The deeper analysis determines whether the school (a) has identified and is utilizing existing resources; (b) is ineffectively or inappropriately using its existing resources; or (c) has resource gaps that can be closed by using other school, district, or community resources, or by purchasing the needed resources. In a school, the breadth of potential resources includes money and finances; facilities and physical plant; materials (e.g., books, videos, equipment) and activities; time, scheduling, deployment, and logistics; people and professional development; technology; and creativity and hard work (Knoff, 2007a; Knoff, 2009b). Table 6.1 outlines specific resources in each of these areas that may be used to address situations (a) and (c) above. Relative to the people resources, this may involve individual and groups of students, staff, administrators, and others inside and outside of the school. This includes individuals who have special expertise in conducting sophisticated multifaceted Special Situation Analyses or in linking their results to effective intervention plans or individuals who are needed to implement the actual intervention.
