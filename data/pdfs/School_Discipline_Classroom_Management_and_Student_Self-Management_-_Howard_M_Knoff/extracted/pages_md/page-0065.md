and it can be used informally by classroom teachers or more formally as part of the school’s early intervening and multi-tiered SPRINT process.

**Action 2.6: Completion of the Consultant Resource Directory.** Beyond the school, districts should also prepare and publish a consultant resource directory, describing the specific skills of the instructional specialists or consultants, related services professionals, special educators, counselors or behavioral intervention specialists, and others with advanced areas of expertise who work in schools or other settings across the district. This directory helps schools find and obtain the expertise and consultative services from other parts of the district when they lack, for example, specific expertise for a student with unusual, complex, or intensive assessment, instructional, or intervention needs.

The behavioral intervention survey, for example, describes a number of specific interventions and asks respondents to rate their expertise with each intervention along a five-point scale from 5—Expert in Both Consultation and Implementation to 1—No Knowledge of the intervention. The results of this survey are used to identify both the intervention expertise of specific professionals in the school and district and the intervention gaps that might require systematic professional development for selected professionals.

The directory should specify the degrees and certifications or board licensure areas of expertise of anyone working in a specific agency or for any private practitioner or group practice. In addition, the types of student disorders addressed by agency personnel or private practitioners, the psychological orientations used (e.g., cognitive-behavioral, family
