Relative to students’ social, emotional, and behavioral status, this committee is important to the extent that students’ academic success often affects how they feel and think about school, their teachers, and their classroom instruction; their social status within their peer group; their emotional and behavioral frustration; and their expectations for future short- and long-term success. Thus, this committee needs to collaborate closely with the school discipline/PBSS committee and the grade- and building-level SPRINT teams, and it often helps to coordinate the continuum of multi-tiered instructional and intervention services, supports, strategies, and programs represented in the PASS model presented in Chapter 1.

The school discipline/PBSS committee is the building-level committee that oversees the school’s social climate and interactions, discipline and behavior management, safety and crisis intervention, and positive behavioral support and intervention activities and processes. Meeting on at least a monthly basis with goals and outcomes connected to the SIP, this committee looks at the most effective ways to teach, infuse, and facilitate the implementation of positive interpersonal, social problem-solving, conflict prevention and resolution, and social, emotional, and behavioral coping skills and interactions across students and staff such that students feel connected to the school, engaged in classroom instruction, and safe across the school’s common areas.

The school discipline/PBSS committee also addresses large-scale issues of teasing, taunting, bullying, harassment, hazing, and physical aggression —working to prevent these situations across the school and student body and responding to them by completing special situation analyses (see Chapters 1, 6, and 7) linked to strategic or intensive interventions, as needed. In addition, this committee oversees the school’s crisis prevention, intervention, and response processes, and selected members are prepared to intervene when crises occur. Finally, this committee works to involve the school’s support staff (e.g., custodians, cafeteria workers, secretaries, bus drivers) in its efforts, and it reaches out to parents, community agencies, and other community leaders in collaborative efforts to extend PBSS activities and outcomes to home and community settings.

Clearly, the school discipline/PBSS committee is the anchor to the school’s PBSS processes. As such, this committee is responsible for planning and implementing the different facets of the PBSS process
