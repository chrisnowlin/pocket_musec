respectively. As introduced in Chapter 1, the classroom accountability system is anchored by the Behavioral Matrix (Knoff, 2007c), a framework that specifies the behavioral expectations, connected with positive responses, motivating incentives, and periodic rewards at each grade level for students in their classrooms. The Behavioral Matrix also identifies four progressive intensity levels of inappropriate behavior connected with corrective responses, consequences, and administrative actions, so that students (a) are aware of how inappropriate behavior will be responded to, and (b) are motivated to avoid these responses by demonstrating appropriate behavior.

Critically, the Behavioral Matrix is developed and implemented with administrator, student, and parent input by each grade-level team in a school so that the social, emotional, and behavioral development and maturation across different age-groups of students is accounted for over time. Significantly, when developed collaboratively by a grade-level team, teachers need to come to a consensus as to (a) what behavioral expectations to teach and emphasize to their students, (b) how to organize different inappropriate behaviors across the four intensity levels, (c) how to most effectively respond to different intensity levels of behaviors, and (d) how to address specific or unique behavioral situations in strategic ways. When implemented collectively by grade-level teams with elective teachers (e.g., music, art, technology/media, health, physical education), related services staff (e.g., counselors, psychologists, behavioral specialists), support staff (e.g., paraprofessionals, secretaries, custodians, cafeteria servers, bus drivers), administrators, and extracurricular staff (e.g., after-school club advisers and athletic coaches), students realize that they will be held accountable for their appropriate and inappropriate behavior, and that their appropriate behavior is far more rewarding.

Relative to the common areas of a school (e.g., hallways, bathrooms, buses, playground, cafeteria, auditorium, sports fields and venues, and other common gathering areas), the Behavioral Matrix has setting-specific behavioral expectations that are common across all of the grade-level matrices. While these expectations are taught in developmentally appropriate ways for students at different age levels, they also include incentives and consequences, relevant to each setting, to motivate students to conform to and perform these expectations.
