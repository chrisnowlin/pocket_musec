# INTRODUCTION

If the ultimate goal of PBSS is student social, emotional, and behavioral competency and self-management, then clearly, students need to learn, master, transfer, and apply the specific skills related to this goal. As noted in Chapter 1, on a social level, skills that are important to self-management include listening, communication and conversation, cooperation, negotiation, refusal, help seeking, positive regard, and how to accept responsibility. On an emotional level, important self-management skills include an awareness of one’s own and others’ feelings, the ability to manage those feelings, and the ability to make the positive self-statements and attributions that support self-esteem, productive expectations, and optimism. Finally, on a behavioral level, important self-management skills include how to follow directions, ignore distractions, and respond to teasing, losing, or rejection; how to acknowledge, apologize, and accept consequences; how to avoid difficult peer or emotionally volatile situations; and how to respond positively and appropriately to peer pressure. In the final analysis, many of the skills in these areas can be organized into interpersonal, social problem-solving, conflict prevention and resolution, and emotional coping beliefs, thoughts, and attributions (i.e., cognitions) and initiations, actions, or responses (i.e., behaviors).
