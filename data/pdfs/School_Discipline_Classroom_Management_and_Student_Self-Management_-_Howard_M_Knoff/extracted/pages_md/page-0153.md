—just like they learn academic skills. While educators often focus on what they don’t want students to do (“don’t fight,” “don’t talk back,” “don’t interrupt,” “don’t tease or taunt other students”), social skills focus on the behaviors that they want students to do. Significantly, when students perform desired behaviors, they rarely perform inappropriate behaviors at the same time.

Because it is organized from preschool through middle school (although the latter manual also is strategically used for specific students at the high school level), and it is part of a schoolwide PBSS, the Stop & Think social skills are taught in all classroom settings in a school by general education teachers. For students with greater need and more challenging behaviors, the social skills also are taught in more targeted social skills training groups by special education, related services, and mental health support professionals.

Some of the core and advanced Stop & Think social skills (some of these skills are taught at the different grade levels) include the following:
