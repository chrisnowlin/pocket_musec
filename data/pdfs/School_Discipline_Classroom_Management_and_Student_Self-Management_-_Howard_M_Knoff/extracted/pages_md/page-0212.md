## Bullying: Definitions, Impacts, and Approaches

Relative to the schools, bullying is defined as a form of repeated aggression where one or more students socially, psychologically or emotionally, physically or behaviorally, or sexually harass or harm other students (a) to a significant degree during one or more incidents, or (b) repeatedly over a period of time. More specifically, bullying can include physical aggression; verbal aggression—including persistent teasing, taunting, and threats; virtual aggression—such as through cyberbullying; the more subtle or indirect aggression that results in social exclusion; or aggression that is sexual, sexually motivated, or gender or gender identity (e.g., gay, lesbian, gender confused) related. Typically, acts of bullying are unprovoked, and the bully is perceived as stronger or as having more power than the victim (Card & Hodges, 2008; Knoff, 2007h, 2009a; Nansel et al., 2001; Pöyhönen, Juvonen, & Salmivalli, 2010). While the research continues to validate and differentiate this area, we have a reasonably clear picture of the (a) characteristics of bullies; (b) developmental patterns of bullying; (c) relationships between victims and bullies; and (d) interventions needed for bullies and to address bullying.

Based on a meta-analysis of 153 studies from a pool of 1,622 studies published since 1970 (Cook et al., 2010), research investigating the predictors of bullying and victimization during childhood and adolescence has identified separate groups of students who are bullies versus bully-victims (who are both victims of bullies and bullies themselves). Pooling this research with other studies (Craig, Pepler, & Atlas, 2000; Espelage & Holt, 2001; Glew et al., 2005; Huesmann & Reynolds, 2001; Leff & Crick, 2010; Nansel et al., 2001; Swearer & Doll, 2001; Swearer, Espelage, & Napolitano, 2009; Swearer et al., 2010; Tolan, Gorman-Smith, & Loeber, 2000; Zins et al., 2007), empirically based characteristics and developmental patterns of bullying appear:
