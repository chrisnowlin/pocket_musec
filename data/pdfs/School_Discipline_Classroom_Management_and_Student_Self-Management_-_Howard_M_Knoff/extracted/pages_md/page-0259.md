knowledge, or understanding of how to work with the student(s)  
(knowledge or professional development); (b) the teacher has the  
knowledge but is not able to transfer it into actual skill or behavior in the  
classroom (skills); (c) the teacher is not motivated to learn the needed  
information or demonstrate the appropriate behavior or is not held  
accountable for these actions by supervisors or administrators in the school  
or district (motivation or accountability); (d) the teacher has the knowledge,  
skills, and motivation but demonstrates them inconsistently during  
classroom interactions with the students (inconsistency); and (e) there are  
unique situations or circumstances affecting the teacher’s ability to  
appropriately or successfully interact with the students (special situations).  
Below are some specific examples or hypotheses in these high-hit areas.  

- **Knowledge or Professional Development and Skills.** Teachers may not  
  have the information or skills to effectively organize their classrooms  
  and teaching schedules; to teach social, emotional, and behavioral  
  skills and classroom routines; to identify meaningful incentives and  
  consequences, and use them consistently; to differentially respond to  
  challenging student behavior as on the Behavioral Matrix; or to  
  implement classroom-based interventions based on data and  
  classroom-oriented functional assessments.  
- **Skills.** In addition to the circumstances above, teachers may not have  
  their own emotional control skills, helping them to maintain their  
  composure when students are exhibiting challenging behavior. When  
  teachers are overly emotional, they may not teach or respond to  
  students’ inappropriate behavior as effectively, or they may not  
  correctly implement interventions designed to eliminate students’  
  challenging behaviors.  
- **Motivation or Accountability.** Unfortunately, some teachers are simply  
  not motivated to help students with challenging behaviors and would  
  rather send them to the office or refer them for special education  
  services than work collaboratively with mental health personnel to  
  meet their needs. A recent study (Miklie & Warner, 2011), based on  
  interviews with more than 10,700 parents and teachers of first grade  
  students, noted that run-down schools with inadequate supplies and  
  teachers who were not respected by their colleagues increased first  
  grade students’ stress—especially those students living in poverty.
