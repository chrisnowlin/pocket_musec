**Positive Action** (published by Positive Action, Inc.; website: [www.positiveaction.net](http://www.positiveaction.net)). This program consists of five components in a K through 12 curriculum: self-concept, physical and intellectual positive actions, and social and emotional positive actions. Each kit contains an instructor’s manual with scripted 15-minute lessons along with prepared materials. Included are student activity booklets, journals (for Grade 4 to 12), and other hands-on materials for 30 students. The lessons contain activities that address academic standards, and some lessons are aligned with states’ standards.

Positive Action is based on the concept that positive thoughts lead to positive actions, positive actions lead to positive feelings about yourself, and positive feelings lead to more positive thoughts. Its goal is to teach positive actions for the physical, intellectual, social, and emotional areas of the self.
