To my wife, Julianna, and (now adult) children—Jesse, David, Janna, and Justin: For your love, support, caring, and presence. For keeping me grounded. For supporting the important work that I do, even in the face of sacrifice and absence. For allowing me to share your lives individually and our lives as a family.

To my colleagues in schools and communities across the country: Thank you for sharing your professional and personal lives and experiences with me. For challenging me, educating me, and including me. For helping me to be practical, realistic, and real. For your persistence in the face of unimaginable challenges and your insistence that we advocate for every student, every school, and every family.
