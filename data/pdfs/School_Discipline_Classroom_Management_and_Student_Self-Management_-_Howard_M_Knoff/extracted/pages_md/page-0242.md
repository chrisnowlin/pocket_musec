approaching all students’ academic and social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes. Functionally, Response-to-Intervention also has been combined with Response-to-Instruction (hence, RTI²) in recognition that some students need modified, different, or more intensive instructional approaches in order to be academically or behaviorally successful, while other students need targeted, strategic, or intensive interventions in order to be successful (Knoff, 2009b; Knoff & Dyer, 2010).

RTI², then, involves evaluating the degree to which students (a) master academic material in response to effective instruction and (b) demonstrate appropriate prosocial behavior in response to effective behavioral instruction and classroom management. It begins in the general education classroom with evidence-based curricula taught by highly qualified teachers using effective instructional practices. When students do not academically or behaviorally progress or respond to effective instructional conditions, RTI² relies on a functional assessment problem-solving process to determine the reasons for the lack of progress or success, linking them to strategic or intensive instructional or interventional approaches that facilitate specific outcomes and student progress, achievement, and proficiency.

Depending on the severity of the problem (e.g., based on frequency, duration, or intensity) or the intensity or complexity of the needed services and supports, the problem-solving process is completed by an individual classroom teacher (with or without consultative support) or through the grade-level or building-level SPRINT team, respectively (see Chapter 3). The focus, ultimately, is on early, responsive, and strategic instruction or intervention that is delivered and evaluated, to the greatest degree possible, in the general education classroom resulting in student learning, mastery, and proficiency on state- and district-identified academic and social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes.

Because some students’ social, emotional, or behavioral challenges directly relate to their academic failure and frustration, the RTI² problem-solving process always considers this possibility from the beginning, analyzing students in the context of their Instructional Environments. As briefly discussed in Chapter 1, the Instructional Environment (see Figure 8.1) consists of the teacher or instructional, curricular, and student factors that help students to succeed, that explain why they do not succeed, or that
