## Primary Building-Level SPRINT Team Goals, Objectives, and Outcomes

1. To oversee the implementation of the SPRINT process in the school, including the school’s adherence to federal, state, and district policies and procedures; the identification (and, at times, provision) of professional development and practice opportunities; the creation or review of needed forms, databases, data collection or evaluation instruments, or other progress monitoring vehicles; and the completion of ongoing and needed community and family outreach activities.
