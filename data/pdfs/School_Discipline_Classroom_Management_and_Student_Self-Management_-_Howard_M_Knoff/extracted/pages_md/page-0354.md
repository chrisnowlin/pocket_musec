The primary goal of a Student Briefing Report, then, is to provide a functional overview of a selected student’s academic and behavioral history and the lessons learned over the recent school year. As such, the Briefing Report should include the

- academic and behavioral background of the student—including critical factors (physical, medical, social, supportive) that impact or contribute to this background,
- academic and behavioral strengths and progress during the past school year,
- academic and behavioral weaknesses and the functional reasons why they exist,
- a description of successful strategies or interventions to address the student’s needs and how they were implemented,
- a description of less successful or unsuccessful strategies or interventions for the student,
- keys to helping this student be successful, and
- other information of note.

When teachers have to write Student Briefing Reports for Get-Go or At-Risk students, we suggest that the reports be part of the check-out process whereby principals formally release their teachers for the summer at the end of the school year. In addition, we also strongly recommend that principals discuss a number of critical issues with staff before they begin writing their Briefing Reports—for example, confidentiality, maintaining objectivity, documenting data, keeping reports secure (especially if they are on an online computer database), and informing parents.

Once written, the Student Briefing Reports can be kept by the building principal or the chair of the building-level SPRINT team over the summer. During the week before the new school year, these reports are given to the new classroom teachers (and relevant others), and a series of meetings can be scheduled to provide additional information, consultation, and training (especially for the Get-Go students) so that all teachers are prepared for all of their students as the new year begins. For Get-Go students, the Student Briefing Reports provide the context and history that make the necessary before-school training (so that the interventions are available for Day 1 implementation) more meaningful. For At-Risk students, the Student
