behavioral challenges who need these more intensive interventions and supports. Yet, when the academic or behavioral progress that teachers make with these challenging students is not shared, and when the lessons learned about how to effectively reach and teach them are not systematically transferred to the next year’s grade-level team or teachers, these students may not receive the best, most proven approaches or materials required for their immediate success at the beginning of the new school year. When this occurs, student progress and achievement is disrupted, student motivation may be impaired, and student success may be compromised. This lack of coordination and articulation represents student services and support inefficiency.

Articulation, then, is a critical process that helps staff to evaluate the accomplishments of the current year, to plan smooth transitions to the next school year (at the school, staff, and student levels), and to maintain and extend the momentum of school and classroom academic, behavioral, and RTI² and SPRINT processes. But to be most successful, articulation activities need to occur at the end of a current school year so that schools are best prepared for the beginning of the next school year. Thus, the organizational principle underscoring all articulation processes is “the beginning of the new school year starts in April.”

While there are many areas of articulation that schools need to plan and execute, this section focuses on those that are directly related to PBSS processes:

- The school discipline/PBSS committee membership, and its annual strategic planning activities
- The Get-Go process
- Student Briefing Reports
- Special Situation Analysis
- Resource needs assessments, results, and planning

Prior to beginning these articulation activities in April, however, the documents and data detailed below need to be collected and available to those who will be involved in the respective articulation processes.
