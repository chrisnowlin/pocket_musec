who communicate with parents to notify them about student injuries, arrests, casualties, or deaths  
- Ensures that there are easy-to-understand briefing cards or checklists outlining the most essential components or procedures above in critical locations in the school (especially at all command and communication posts), at central assembly locations, and with district or community support personnel  
- Establishes an evaluation and debriefing process (sometimes called an after-action review) that occurs after each emergency event to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the multifaceted response systems and to make recommendations (as needed) for changes or improvements in these processes—including the need for additional prevention or response training, resources, activities, or elements  
- Establishes and prepares a post-crisis response process that addresses the immediate student, staff, family, and community post-crisis needs and activities as well as their needs and activities for the first weeks, month, quarter, half year, and full year as well as anniversary dates post-crisis  

There are three types of crises for schools to plan for: a crisis with advanced notice, one with minimal notice, and one with no notice. A crisis with advanced notice is one that is impending and that a school or district has one or more hours to prepare for. For example, a tornado watch occurs when weather conditions exist that may result in tornadoes, and this advanced notice status gives schools time to send students home early, secure students in safe areas, or remind them about tornado signals and procedures. A crisis with minimal notice is one that is imminent and typically cannot be avoided and that a school or district has less than an hour to prepare for. For example, a tornado warning occurs when funnel clouds have been observed by eyewitnesses or on Doppler radar, and this notice results in immediate evacuations of students and staff into secure areas and emergency-related announcements or notifications to parents and others. A crisis with no notification is one that occurs without warning, for example, when a major earthquake demolishes a town leaving significant, widespread damage and a high number of fatalities. This calls for the full implementation of all school and community emergency procedures,
