time-out, a note or call home, completion by the student of a behavior change plan).
- Intensity III (Persistent or Antisocial) Behavior: Behavior problems in the classroom that significantly (as a single incident) or persistently (increasing in severity over time) disrupt classroom instruction or engagement or that involve antisocial interactions toward adults or peers. These inappropriate behaviors require some type of out-of-classroom response (e.g., time-out in another teacher’s classroom, removal to an in-school suspension or student accountability room, an office discipline referral), followed up by a payback response (e.g., an apology, cleaning up or repairing damaged property or a messed-up classroom, community service), a consequence, and, if needed, an intervention to eliminate a reoccurrence of the problem behavior.
- Intensity IV (Severe or Dangerous) Behavior: Extremely antisocial, damaging, or dangerous behaviors, on a physical, social, or emotional level that typically are cited and addressed in a district’s student code of conduct handbook. These inappropriate behaviors require an immediate administrative referral and response (e.g., a parent conference, suspension, or expulsion), followed by a payback response and an intervention to eliminate a reoccurrence of the problem behavior.

Specific lists of possible inappropriate behaviors at each of these intensity levels have been collected over the years and are presented later in this chapter. Right now, however, we want to establish the relationship between the four intensity levels of inappropriate behavior and the research-based responses that address the inappropriate behavior, while motivating more appropriate behavior in the future (see the boxes and explanations below).
