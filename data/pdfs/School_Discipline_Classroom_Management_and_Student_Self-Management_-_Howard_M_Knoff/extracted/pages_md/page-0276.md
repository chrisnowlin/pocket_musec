resources needed to implement the plan have been acquired, it is ready to be executed.

# Step 6: Implementing the Intervention Plan and Process

In order to be most successful, interventions must be (a) acceptable and realistic, (b) able to produce meaningful and needed results, (c) taught to teachers and students—as appropriate and relevant—before implementation, (d) implemented as empirically designed and with integrity and appropriate levels of intensity, and (e) useful for other students who are at risk or struggling in the classroom but have not, as yet, been identified for the RTI² process.

Relative to (c), students should be taught all facets of a social, emotional, or behavioral intervention prior to its implementation. This is comparable to what effective teachers do when they introduce a well-designed academic lesson or intervention to their students. More specifically, teachers or specialists who are implementing a strategic or intensive behavioral intervention need to discuss, teach, and practice the following with their students:

- The reason for, goals, and outcomes of the intervention;
- How the intervention will be presented, and what is expected of them (e.g., in terms of engagement, participation, response, and relevant practice);
- How they will receive feedback and what incentives or benefits are available;
- How the intervention will be evaluated (or how its progress will be monitored) for success and what success will look like at different points in time;
- How the intervention can be used in the classroom independently by the student; and
- Why the intervention will be successful in that the materials and techniques have been specially selected to maximize the student’s success.

## Involving Other Students in Intervention Implementation

As noted above, when preparing an intervention plan, a decision is made as to
