At the prevention level (see the first section of this chapter), the ultimate question is: “Who or what will motivate everyone in the school to create and sustain a positive, nurturing, supportive environment where everyone interacts in the common areas of the school in tolerant, prosocial, and proactive ways?” At the problem-solving level, the ultimate question (if this domain is contributing to the problem) is, “Who and what is reinforcing the appropriate versus the inappropriate student (or staff) behavior occurring in a specific common school area?”

To answer this latter question, the functional assessment should look at the groups of students delineated above, the administration, staff, and other adults in the school, and other individuals (e.g., older siblings, parents, peers attending other schools) to determine how they might be motivating or reinforcing, consciously or inadvertently, the inappropriate behavior that is occurring. Often, the assessment looks at the antecedent conditions (i.e., the situations that exist or what happens before the inappropriate behavior), the characteristics of the inappropriate behavior that results, and the outcomes or consequences that follow as a result of the inappropriate behavior. Periodically, these analyses produce confounded or what appear to be contradictory results. For example, there are times when the adults are positively reinforcing appropriate common area behavior, while the peer group is positively reinforcing the inappropriate behavior and negatively reinforcing students who are complying with the adults’ expectations. At other times, staff members appear to be holding students accountable for their inappropriate behavior, but they occasionally let students get away with inappropriate behavior, which ends up strengthening this inappropriate behavior over time. Finally, when a group of students, or an entire student body, receives consequences for the inappropriate behavior of a small number of students whom they cannot influence (e.g., having an assembly cancelled when a few students are unruly), the larger group of students may themselves demonstrate higher levels of inappropriate behavior because of their frustration or to protest the inequity (from their perspective) of the consequence.

Relative to the running, pushing, and shoving in the middle school hallway example, it is important to integrate the questions within the incentives and consequences domain with the other special situation domains to determine why inappropriate behaviors are occurring in the hallway:
