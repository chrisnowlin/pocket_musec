**Monthly Agenda:**

- Collects the lists of social skills that are being taught at each grade level each month, compiling them on a monthly master calendar that is sent to all of the elective teachers, non-instructional staff, and relevant others across the school for their information and use.

- Discusses how the social skills are working at the grade levels and across the building.

- Discusses ways to continue using the social skills language continuously across the building by all staff and with all students.

- Identifies the existence of any building-level special situations (e.g., in the cafeteria, the hallways, at recess, on the playground, or on the bus) and completes any needed special situations analyses and subsequent interventions.

Over time, the Committee also undertakes additional activities:

- Helps to develop, implement, and periodically review the classroom, grade-level, and buildingwide accountability system that identifies expected student behavior (with corresponding incentives) and different levels of inappropriate student behavior (with corresponding consequences or administrative responses).
