execute their classroom instruction (i.e., “Are appropriate instructional and management strategies being used?”); and (c) the students who are engaged in learning, their ability and motivation to master the instructional material, and their responses to effective instruction and sound curricula (i.e., “Is each student capable, prepared, motivated, and able to learn, and are they learning?”).

Critically, the data-based, functional assessment, problem-solving process and effective school and schooling practices, described earlier, work implicitly within this component. This occurs as the three facets of the Instructional Environment are analyzed proactively to determine how to design and implement the most effective instruction so that the highest number of students are academically successful. For those students who are unsuccessful, however, specific characteristics or processes within the three Instructional Environment components are analyzed to determine the reasons, individually or collectively, for their lack of success. Using the data-based, functional assessment, problem-solving process, for example, for a student with ongoing difficulties in third grade mathematics, a classroom teacher, independently or with the grade- or building-level RTI² team, might

- analyze the design and organization of the curriculum, its scope and sequence, its materials, and its contribution to the student’s understanding, learning, and progress;
- evaluate his or her lesson plans, instructional delivery and pace, sensitivity and differentiation with the student, and accuracy in evaluating the student’s understanding and mastery of material and skills over time; or
- assess the student’s specific mastery of prerequisite skills, understanding of the instructional goals and directions, and progress when more concrete and sequential instruction, positive practice opportunities, or specific guidance and feedback are provided.

Once the reasons for a student’s lack of success are validated, the results are linked to needed instructional or intervention services, supports, strategies, and programs. Here is where Project ACHIEVE’s academic service-delivery blueprint, the PASS model, is used (see Figure 1.2).
