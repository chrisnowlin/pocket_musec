individuals such as Robert Marzano, Bill Daggett, Ted Sizer, Larry Lezotte, James Comer, and others. These models share a number of key constructs that create a foundation for any school’s continuous improvement efforts and processes. These constructs involve a schoolwide commitment to

- a culture of high and realistic expectations for all students that is supported by a shared mission, vision, values, and goals;
- data-driven decision making that focuses on continuous improvement;
- validation, verification, evaluation, and accountability;
- articulated and differentiated academic and social, emotional, and behavioral (or health, mental health, and wellness) curricula;

- partnerships that reach out to and actively engage families and community partners;
- positive and safe school climates that engage and connect students in sustained, meaningful relationships; and
- a formal and informal system of shared, multileveled leadership.

Beyond these key constructs, these models also have a common core of effective school components. While they may use different labels, these components have been integrated into an evidence-based school improvement model known as Project ACHIEVE (Knoff & Batsche, 1995; Knoff, Finch, & Carlyon, 2004). Project ACHIEVE is a comprehensive preschool through high school continuous improvement and school effectiveness program that has been implemented in hundreds of urban, suburban, and rural districts across the country since 1990. Project ACHIEVE was recognized by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) as an evidence-based model prevention program in 2000. Its effectiveness has also been recognized by the U.S. Department of Justice’s
