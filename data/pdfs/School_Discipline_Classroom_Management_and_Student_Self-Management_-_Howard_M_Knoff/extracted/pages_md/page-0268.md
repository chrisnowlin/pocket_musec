related to instructional or curricular modifications or accommodations,  
assistive supports, or compensatory strategies.  

When one or more of the seven previously discussed high-hit student-specific hypotheses are confirmed, they link to distinctive instructional or intervention domains. To be more specific (see Figure 8.5), confirmed  

- Skill deficit hypotheses (Hypothesis #1 from the section above) generally require approaches that involve skill teaching or instruction;  
- Speed of acquisition hypotheses (Hypothesis #2) require approaches that involve increasing students’ rate of skill learning and mastery;  
- Transfer of training or generalization hypotheses (Hypothesis #3) require approaches that specifically train to facilitate skill transfer;  
- Conditions of emotionality hypotheses (Hypothesis #4) require approaches that help students to either prevent or control their emotional reactions—physiologically, affectively, cognitively, and behaviorally—so that they can behaviorally interact or respond effectively even while some emotionality still exists;  
- Motivation or performance deficit hypotheses (Hypothesis #5) require approaches that involve motivating students to demonstrate expected or desired social, emotional, or behavioral interactions or responses;  
- Inconsistency hypotheses (Hypothesis #6) require approaches that isolate and decrease the inconsistency, while building and strengthening consistency and addressing the prior impact of inconsistency; and  

### Figure 8.5 Moving From Problem Analysis to Intervention  

- Goal #1/Skill Deficit: → Teach  
- Goal #2/Speed of Acquisition: → Increase learning rate  
- Goal #3/Transfer of Training/Generalization: → Train for the transfer  
- Goal #4/Conditions of Emotionality: → Prevent/control emotionality  
- Goal #5/Motivation/Performance Deficit: → Motivate  
- Goal #6/Inconsistency: → Decrease inconsistency  
- Goal #7/Special Situation: → Resolve situation/target social, emotional, or behavioral skills
