and that cannot physically coexist with or be performed at the same time as an inappropriate behavior (e.g., reinforcing in-seat behavior to decrease classroom wandering). In addition, these incompatible or alternative behaviors must be socially acceptable and not embarrassing to the student.

Conversely, these four differential reinforcement approaches are not good options (a) if the target student demonstrates a number of inappropriate behaviors that cannot be ignored or tolerated; (b) if these inappropriate behaviors happen so frequently that they might inadvertently be reinforced as another behavior; (c) if appropriate reinforcers cannot be found or used; or (d) if teacher-delivered reinforcers are not more powerful than other reinforcers (e.g., peer attention) that are maintaining the inappropriate behavior.

**Extinction or Planned Ignoring.** This intervention often is considered when a student is using inappropriate behavior (e.g., persistent whining, complaining, clinging, calling or blurting out in class) to attract adult or peer attention. When he or she receives this attention (usually from adults in the form of a corrective response or a mild consequence—see Intensity I and II on the Behavioral Matrix in Chapter 4, page 80, Figure 4.2), the inappropriate behavior is reinforced and may actually be strengthened. Thus, with a goal of eliminating the inappropriate behavior and replacing it with appropriate behavior, this intervention involves the planned ignoring of the student’s inappropriate behavior. At the same time, the appropriate behavior of others near the student is positively reinforced, and appropriate behavior by the target student is progressively shaped and reinforced in direct contrast to the inappropriate behavior. Over time, the inappropriate behavior is eliminated (or extinguished), but this often occurs after (a) a significant increase in the student’s inappropriate behavior during the first part of the intervention (typically during the first five to eight days), and (b) the teacher (and the peer group) have consistently ignored the student’s continuing inappropriate attention-seeking behavior past the time frame in which this behavior was inappropriately attended to and reinforced in the past.

In order to implement this intervention effectively, the teacher, behavioral consultant or specialist, or mental health practitioner should follow a specific sequence of steps:
