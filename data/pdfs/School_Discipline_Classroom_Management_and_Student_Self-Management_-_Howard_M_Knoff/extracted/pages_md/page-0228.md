Relative to strategies, when a fight actually occurs, school administrations typically use their district’s code of conduct, which often recommends a multi-day school suspension for the students directly involved. Just prior to the suspension, however, the administrators need to ask a critical question: “Will this suspension, while required as an administrative response on the code of conduct (and on the school’s Behavioral Matrix—see Chapter 4), also act as an intervention by eliminating future fights between these students once they return?” If the answer is “No,” then the administrators should initiate the steps needed to determine why the fight occurred and what services, supports, strategies, or programs are needed to prevent future fights. To accomplish this, the administrators may assemble selected members of their school discipline/PBSS committee or building-level School Prevention, Review, and Intervention Team (SPRINT; see Chapter 3) to begin the analysis process—even during the suspensions. In fact, before the suspended students leave the school with their parents, an administrator may inform them that they are required, under the conditions of the suspension, to show up at the district office where, for example, a school psychologist, counselor, or social worker will meet with them (students and parents) to debrief, discuss, and analyze the history, prevailing conditions, and underlying reasons for the fight.

During this meeting or series of meetings, more formal individual student assessments may be conducted, and more formal mediation sessions may be required involving both students and parents. In addition, the students may be required to role-play, with each other and in the presence of their parents, ways (a) to prosocially interact, (b) to prevent future escalations of disagreements or tensions, (c) to diffuse higher levels of tension or conflict, and (d) to disengage from the highest levels of conflict that again may result in a physical altercation.

Eventually, another meeting—with an administrator from the school and selected others—should occur to discuss how the students will re-enter the school and handle the first day back after the suspension. If ready and needed, part of this meeting also may involve the preparation of a longer-term intervention plan with the involved students and their parents. Critically, when the suspension is over, the actual re-entry process should begin where both students, individually or together, meet in the principal’s office (or with someone who has been predesignated) as soon as the
