Relative to the skills and behaviors required within each common school area phase, these are best taught using the same script and skill and social learning theory (i.e., teach, model, role-play, performance feedback, transfer of training) approaches discussed for the social skills training in Chapter 5. While the scripts may differ and the instruction may be modified for students at different grade or maturational levels, some sample scripts for different common school areas are shown below (Knoff, 2007e).
