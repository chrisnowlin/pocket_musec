If the assessment data show a high degree of chair throwing when we give Jason math assignments that we know are well above his ability level and we see him visibly frustrated, and little or no chair throwing occurs when we give him assignments that are well within his ability level and he is engaged and on-task, then the hypothesis is confirmed. If we see chair throwing regardless of the difficulty level of the math work, then the hypothesis is rejected, and we conclude that this variable (assignment difficulty) does not explain the inappropriate behavior and should not be the foundation for an intervention. At this point, we need to generate and assess other hypotheses.

Critically, when a hypothesis for a student’s inappropriate behavior relates to a skill that the student has never learned and mastered, it cannot be assessed using positive and converse prediction statements. For example, if a student has constant peer conflicts because he does not (have the skill to) recognize when they are being sarcastic with him, we cannot test the hypothesis “When Josh realizes that peers are being sarcastic, he does not get into a conflict with them.” This is because Josh does not have this skill, and thus, we will never be able to observe this converse prediction condition. Given this, hypotheses involving skill deficits are confirmed when assessments confirm that a student’s skill or behavior has not been mastered.

Without going into further detail, note that there are six primary approaches, summarized in the acronym RIOTSS, that can be used to collect the assessment data in Step 4:

- **Review** (e.g., records, work samples, previous assessments, databases);
- **Interview** (e.g., parents, previous teachers, previous intervention specialists, the student);
- **Observe** (e.g., in the classroom, during assessments or interventions, in related settings);
- **Test** (e.g., group or individual cognitive, achievement, behavioral, or personality assessments);
- **Survey** (e.g., a class of students, a grade level of teachers); and
