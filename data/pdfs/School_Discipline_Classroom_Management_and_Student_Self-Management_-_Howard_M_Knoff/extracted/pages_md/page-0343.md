| | **Group Contingency Interventions:** Behavior management approaches where students in a classroom are organized into teams and they work for reinforcement as a team. Three different approaches can be used here: where all students must meet a set level of behavioral expectations; where any student can lose or earn points on behalf of a team; or where a specific student (rotating) can lose or earn points on behalf of a team. |
