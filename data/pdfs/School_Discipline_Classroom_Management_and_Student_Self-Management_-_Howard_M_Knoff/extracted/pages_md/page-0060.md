**Action 1.3: Completion of School Status and Longitudinal History Self-Study.** Based on the self-study or self-evaluation in Action 1.2 above, the study team determines the current status of the school, staff, and students, and the school’s PBSS-related outcomes over at least the last three years; problem areas and areas where the school is not achieving desired outcomes (i.e., where there are negative, nonexistent, or slower-than-desired outcomes); and reasons for the identified accomplishments and non-accomplishments. This begins the process of identifying what PBSS-related issues or outcomes the school needs to address through the chosen PBSS program or initiative and what existing activities or programs need to be maintained or discontinued, respectively.

**Action 1.4: Completion of Staff, Stakeholder, and Consumer Motivational Analysis.** As Actions 1.2 through 1.3 are proceeding, the study team or SLT completes a motivational analysis of the support, the potential support, and the opposition to the PBSS initiative across its staff and other stakeholder, constituency, and consumer groups, including community partners and parents. Through this analysis, the SLT also identifies those willing to publicize their commitment to the initiative and takes steps to gain the support of those who are on the fence or in opposition.

**Action 1.5: Identification and Analysis of Effective PBSS Schools; PBSS Request for Proposals.** If the study team wants to expand its Action 1.1 research review and internet search by identifying a number of already-existing effective PBSS programs, it locates these successful PBSS schools—nationally or within its state—matching them to the school’s demographic and other student and staff characteristics. For schools willing to share their experiences and expertise, telephone or net-supported interviews, and/or virtual or actual school visitations then can occur.

**Action 1.6: Choosing the Best PBSS Model and/or Project Director for the School.** In order to choose the best PBSS model or approach, the study team matches the implementation and outcomes from the PBSS models or approaches researched in Action 1.1 to the problem areas and needs resulting from Action 1.3. At this point, especially if the school is going to independently implement the chosen PBSS model or approach, the team
