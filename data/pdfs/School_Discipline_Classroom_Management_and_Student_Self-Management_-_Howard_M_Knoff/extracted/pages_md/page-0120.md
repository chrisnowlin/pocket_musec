student is not positively responding to the Intensity III responses, consequences, and positive practice re-entry and accountability procedures.

## INTENSITY IV (SEVERE OR DANGEROUS) BEHAVIOR IS RESPONDED TO WITH AN ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSE, FOLLOWED BY AN (INTENSIVE) INTERVENTION

An administrative response is generally neither a consequence nor an intervention in a technical sense. Initially, it involves an action or response that helps to stabilize a student, group of students, classroom, or common school area when a significant or dangerous disciplinary situation occurs. Eventually, the administrative response includes an action, typically included in the school or district’s code of conduct, involving a high impact consequence meant to both communicate the serious nature of the infraction and motivate an immediate change of behavior.

Critically, as administrators implement consequences with students (typically involving their parents), the following question is essential: “Will this (for example) three-day suspension, while an appropriate consequence, also act as an intervention such that it immediately decreases or eliminates future inappropriate behavior while increasing immediate and future appropriate behavior?” If the answer is “Yes,” then the consequence is also an intervention. If the answer is “No,” then the administrator should immediately convene the building-level SPRINT team to begin the data-based functional assessment, problem-solving process.
