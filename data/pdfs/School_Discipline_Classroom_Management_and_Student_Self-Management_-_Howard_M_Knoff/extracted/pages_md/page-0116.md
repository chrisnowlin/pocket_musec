# ACTION

The corrective responses in the Behavioral Matrix are organized along a continuum of effective teaching responses ranging from least intrusive to more directive. While teachers should use the least intrusive corrective action possible, these are matched to the specific student involved. That is, for a specific student, the teacher should choose the corrective action that communicates most effectively that he or she is being annoying and that most quickly stops the annoying behavior, replacing it with appropriate behavior.

When developing a Behavioral Matrix, different grade-level teams rarely change the sequence of the effective teaching and corrective responses for Intensity I behaviors. This sequence includes corrective actions:

- Teacher visual, nonverbal, or physical prompt or cue
- Teacher proximity
- Teacher verbal or nonverbal redirect to the appropriate behavior needed
- Teacher warning
- Student is moved to another seat in the classroom
- Teacher ends the activity for the student; student waits until the next activity is introduced
- Teacher calls home with student from the classroom*
- Teacher sends a note home (written by the student) with parent signature required*
