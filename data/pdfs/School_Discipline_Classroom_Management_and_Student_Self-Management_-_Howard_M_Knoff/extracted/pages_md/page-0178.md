and response continuum was introduced as part of the ten scientific principles discussed in Chapter 1 (see Figure 1.3, Chapter 1).

Relative to identifying the logistical and behavioral expectations in the different common areas of the school, a functional and task analytic approach is recommended. That is, staff members need to determine the different phases of student movement within each setting and what they want students to do within each phase. Below are the typical phases within a number of common school areas. Critically, for each of these settings, staff members (and students) need to determine the behavioral expectations for the typical or routine circumstances and situations within each phase, the skills or behaviors that students should be taught to prevent or quickly resolve mild conflict or challenging situations, and what staff prompts and student responses are needed when extreme conflict or emergency situations occur.

**Hallway Phases:**

1. Lining up and exiting the classroom or other setting
2. Walking down the hallway and interacting with peers or staff
3. Entering the next classroom or setting

**Bathroom Phases:**

1. Lining up and entering the bathroom
2. Using the facilities
3. Washing and drying hands and throwing away towels (if needed)
4. Exiting the bathroom and returning to class or another setting

**Bus Phases:**

1. Appropriate behavior and interactions at the bus stop
2. Lining up and entering the bus
3. Walking within and sitting down in the bus
4. In-seat behavior and interactions
5. Leaving the seat and walking to the bus exit
6. Exiting the bus and walking to the next setting (e.g., the playground, into the school, back home)
