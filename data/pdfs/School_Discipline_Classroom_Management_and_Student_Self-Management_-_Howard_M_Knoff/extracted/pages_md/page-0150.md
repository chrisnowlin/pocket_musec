Taken together, all of the research cited above reinforces the impact of social, emotional, and behavioral instruction in the classroom—from elementary through high school; the importance of involving classroom teachers, along with other school personnel; and the impact of learning programs that focus on explicit, skill-based outcomes and active, sequenced learning. Clearly, the connection between students’ academic success and their social competency appears to be reciprocal, with difficulties in one precipitating difficulties in the other. Indeed, if a student cannot stay in his or her seat, work independently, or cooperate in a project-based learning group, academic achievement will be more challenging. Conversely, if a student is not academically successful over time, this may result in withdrawal or frustration, or other more serious emotional or behavioral problems.

# THE SCIENTIFIC CRITERIA OF AN EFFECTIVE SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL, AND BEHAVIORAL SKILLS PROGRAM

Based on a synthesis of the research above, as well as implementation practice across the country, seven scientific criteria of an effective social, emotional, or behavioral skills program are suggested:

1. Effective social, emotional, or behavioral skills programs teach sensible and pragmatic interpersonal, social problem-solving, conflict prevention and resolution, and emotional coping skills that are needed by today’s students and can be applied on a daily basis by preschool through high school students.
2. These effective programs help to address problem situations that frequently occur in classrooms and common areas of the school (Kerr & Nelson, 2010).
3. These programs organize their skills in defined, progressive, yet flexible sequences that are taught across the school year and are integrated into (or become) a district’s articulated and scaffolded health, mental health, and wellness program. The skills are sequenced recognizing that some skills are prerequisite to and must be taught and
