Once grade-level representatives receive all of their respective colleagues’ forms, they pool all of the data onto worksheets for each completed form. At this point, the representatives look for items that have been endorsed (or not) by a majority of their grade-level peers. For example, if there are five teachers on a fourth grade team (e.g., four classroom teachers and the art teacher representing her elective area colleagues), any item that is endorsed by four or five teachers should be included at a specific classroom expectation or intensity level. Any item endorsed by none or only one of the teachers should not be included at the level. Finally, any item endorsed by two or three teachers should be placed on a list to be discussed by the entire team during a grade-level meeting.
