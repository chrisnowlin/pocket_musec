and it motivates the student to discontinue the inappropriate behavior in the future (to avoid the need for future overcorrection). Examples of positive practice overcorrections include making a student excessively practice making positive and supportive statements instead of ongoing negative, hurtful, or critical statements; silently walking in the hallway instead of running and screaming; or raising one’s hand with mouth closed, instead of blurting out answers.

In restitutive overcorrection, the student must repair, fix, and/or apologize and make amends—far beyond the initial harm, damage, or hurt—for an inappropriate act or action. This intervention holds the student accountable (and then some) for the original offense, helps the student to remember the consequences for specific behaviors, and motivates the student to avoid such consequences in the future, knowing that they will be applied again if the inappropriate behavior is re-exhibited. While the remediation in this intervention is logically connected to a student’s inappropriate behavior, once again, this intervention is consciously and strategically implemented as an aversive technique. Examples of restitutive overcorrections include making a student wash all of the desks in a classroom or the bathroom walls in a school for marking up desks or writing graffiti, respectively; performing community service hours working with younger students for earlier incidents of teasing, taunting, or harassing these students; or apologizing to the entire class for an offense to a smaller group of students.

In order to implement this intervention effectively, the teacher, behavioral consultant or specialist, or mental health practitioner should follow a specific sequence of steps:

1. Identify the specific behavior or offense that needs to be decreased or eliminated.
2. Complete a functional assessment of the behavior, including a history of when, where, how often, and with whom the behavior has occurred in the past, while determining why the inappropriate behavior is occurring (e.g., emotional control problems, attention, power or control, revenge, escape, etc.).
3. Determine which overcorrection approach will be used and what replacement behavior (for the positive practice overcorrection approach) or remediation or restorative behavior (for the restitutive
