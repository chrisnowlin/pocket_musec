To begin, after specifying and clarifying the special situation problem and the common school area where it is occurring (problem identification), the reasons underlying the problem are analyzed across the five special situation domains (problem analysis) along with the existing strengths, resources, and other factors that are periodically preventing the problem, or preventing the problem from being more serious. Typically, given the ecological and interactive nature of most common school areas, the underlying reasons for a specific challenge or concern often involve two or more domains. Once the sources of the problem are validated, an intervention plan is devised, implemented, and evaluated (intervention and evaluation). Critically, while fewer than five domains may be responsible for the problem, all five domains generally are involved in the intervention.

Below are descriptions of the most important areas to investigate during problem analysis for each of the five special situation domains. In order to best understand this information, it might be important to read and then re-read this section after reading the problem analysis section in Chapter 7 and all of Chapter 8.

**Student Characteristics, Issues, and Factors.** The problem analysis process here evaluates the who, what, when, where, why, and how conditions that exist when the problem situation occurs and does not occur and that result from or follow its occurrence or nonoccurrence. This analysis is completed for four related groups of students:

- The students who are exhibiting the problem
- The students who are contributing to the problem but are not the primary offenders
- The students who are not part of the problem but are bystanders observing the problem
- The students who are trying to prevent or minimize the impact of the problem and who might be involved in the long-term intervention or resolution of the problem

For the students who are exhibiting or contributing to the problem, the functional assessment analyzes the gap between the interpersonal, social problem-solving, conflict prevention and resolution, and emotional coping skills that these students have but are not demonstrating and the skills that
