collaboration and treatment. While not a requirement or criterion for Tier 3 services, if a disability is present and is significantly contributing to or causing a student’s difficulties, the instructional or intervention services, supports, strategies, or programs could be delivered as part of a 504 plan or an Individual Education Plan (IEP).

Relative to students with Tier 3 social, emotional, or behavioral needs, part of a comprehensive instructional or intervention plan will involve one or more of the services outlined in Figure 9.2. Critically, it must be noted that some or many of these students will still be in their general education classes receiving Tier 1 and Tier 2, in addition to Tier 3, services. Once again, this is determined by the functional assessments, the students’ specific needs, and where the school or district categorizes its different services or supports across their three-tiered continuum. Most important is the fact that Tier 3 services generally focus on individual student strategies and services, and that classroom teachers and other school staff, while not primarily responsible for implementing these services, need to understand their implications and applications relative to instructional processes in their classrooms. Indeed, while some elements of Tier 3 services need to be confidential, teachers and other school staff still need to know (a) how the information learned during the problem analysis and student-focused intervention steps relate to a student’s classroom and school functioning and success and (b) how to prompt or use the social, emotional, or behavioral approaches being taught, for example, in therapy so that they transfer to classroom and other school settings. While a detailed discussion of the services in Figure 9.2 is beyond the scope of this book, a brief description does follow below.
