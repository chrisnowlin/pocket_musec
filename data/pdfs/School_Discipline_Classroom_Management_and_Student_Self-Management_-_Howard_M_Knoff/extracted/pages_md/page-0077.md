**Action 1.6: Parent and Community Outreach Program.** During the winter or spring, the school discipline/PBSS committee should implement (if this has not yet occurred) a PBSS outreach program to parents, community agencies, and other community leaders and constituencies. This outreach could involve training that extends the school’s PBSS, for example, to families, community-based social service and support agencies, day care or afterschool care and weekend programs, the faith community, or the business community. Alternatively, this outreach might involve a communitywide collaborative effort to extend the PBSS to as many community-based and family settings and circumstances as possible.

**Action 1.9: End-of-Year Formative Evaluations.** At the end of the school year, the school discipline/PBSS committee, in collaboration with the administration and SLT, conducts formative and summative evaluations on the different facets of the PBSS so that new strategic plans and implementation activities and processes can be identified and written into the new school improvement plan.

**Action 1.10: Summer Facilitators’ Institute.** During June at the end of Year 2, a summer institute is held for staff members who spent Implementation Year 2 as PBSS facilitators (this could include a second cohort of new facilitators who are beginning this advanced training). During
