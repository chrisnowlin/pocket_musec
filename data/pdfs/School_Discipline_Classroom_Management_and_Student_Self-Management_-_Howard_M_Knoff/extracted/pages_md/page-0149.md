behavioral learning programs that had four research-based training procedures: (a) explicit learning goals, (b) a focus on skill development, (c) a sequenced step-by-step training approach, and (d) active forms of learning (e.g., behavioral rehearsal, cooperative learning).

In the end, the results indicated that the learning programs that used all four recommended training procedures and that were taught by classroom teachers, respectively, were effective in all six outcome areas. The programs taught by teachers or other school staff and that used more than one of the four research-based training procedures were effective in four outcome areas (i.e., attitudes, conduct problems, emotional distress, and academic performance). The programs that did not use all four recommended training procedures and that were taught by nonschool personnel, respectively, were effective in only three outcome areas (i.e., attitudes, conduct problems, and academic performance for the former, and improved social and emotional skills, prosocial attitudes, and fewer conduct problems for the latter). Finally, students’ academic performance significantly improved only when the social, emotional, and behavioral learning program was taught by classroom teachers or other school personnel.

A separate meta-analysis of classroomwide programs focused on building and improving the social skills of almost 13,000 general education students (January, Casey, & Paulson, 2011) revealed that the 28 peer-reviewed studies, included in the analyses and conducted between 1981 and 2007, produced small and positive effect sizes. More specifically, the analysis revealed that the social skill programs studied (a) had the greatest effect at the preschool and kindergarten and then the middle school age levels; (b) did not vary according to the socioeconomic (i.e., free lunch) status of the students (although there was a trend toward greater intervention effects in classrooms or schools with higher percentages of free and reduced-price lunch students); (c) demonstrated greater effects when the program was longer in duration and when students had more opportunities to practice and maintain their social skills; and (d) favored programs that used role-playing and other experiential activities, rather than seat-work-based instruction and memorization. As the programs averaged only 25 hours of implementation (i.e., less than one hour per week), it was suggested that programs that infused their skill instruction and practice throughout the school year, embedding them into daily classroom activities and interactions, would show stronger and more lasting effects.
