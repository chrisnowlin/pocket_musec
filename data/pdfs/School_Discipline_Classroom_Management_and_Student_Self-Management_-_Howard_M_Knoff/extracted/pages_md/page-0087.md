described in Chapter 1. The role and responsibilities of this committee are discussed more specifically later in this chapter.

The professional development/teacher support and mentoring committee oversees, facilitates, and evaluates the school’s professional development (PD) and formal and informal collegial supervision and support activities. These activities should help all staff feel professionally and personally connected to the school and its organizational, planning, instruction, and continuous improvement processes and motivate them to interact instructionally and personally with students and each other at the highest levels of effectiveness.

The professional development/teacher support and mentoring committee also can help welcome and orient staff who are new to the building each year, coordinate the teacher mentoring program for teachers who are new to the profession, and guide others who have completed this induction process and are moving toward earning tenure. In addition, this committee might stay abreast of new pedagogical or technological advances in the field, periodically briefing the faculty on these new approaches and how they could improve the school and schooling process.
