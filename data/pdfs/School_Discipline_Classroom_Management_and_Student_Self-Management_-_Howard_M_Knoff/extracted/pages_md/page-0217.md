or discourage TTBHHPA attempts, and feel comfortable reporting bullying incidents in a safe and confidential manner; (b) prosocial and supportive classroom settings that teach and reinforce appropriate interpersonal interactions between students and between students and adults; (c) safe and secure common areas of the school (e.g., hallways, cafeteria, buses) where peer groups demonstrate and reinforce prosocial interactions and actively deter TTBHHPA; and (d) involved parents and community partners who collaborate such that everyone is aware of and engaged in reinforcing a prosocial and no tolerance for antisocial behavior school culture. From a student perspective, the focus is on promoting students’ self-management and social competency skills, knowing that these skills typically prevent TTBHHPA. Indeed, throughout this book, discussions have emphasized the importance of teaching students interpersonal, social problem-solving, conflict prevention and resolution, and emotional coping skills (Chapter 5); motivating and holding them accountable for using these prosocial skills (Chapter 4); maintaining consistency relative to behavioral expectations, instruction, and accountability; and applying or reinforcing appropriate student and staff behavior in the common areas of the school (Chapter 6).

While not yet emphasized, most of the components above also help students and staff to respond to mild levels of TTBHHPA such that these incidents are immediately addressed, discouraged, and quickly eliminated. More specifically, a closer look at the sample Stop & Think social skills in Chapter 5 reveals that students are routinely taught a number of TTBHHPA response skills (e.g., responding to teasing, to peer pressure, to being rejected or left out; understanding others’ feelings; walking away from a fight). These skills can help victims and bystanders to respond effectively to those who, for example, tease, taunt, or bully; and, when used, these responses might discourage or eliminate future inappropriate interactions.

A closer look at the sample Behavioral Matrices in Chapter 4 reveals that there are corrective responses, consequences, and administrative actions suggested for staff when they observe different intensity levels of TTBHHPA. Beyond this, when the Behavioral Matrix is taught to and used consistently with students, and when the Matrix consequences for TTBHHPA are explicitly outlined at the beginning of the school year, this training often becomes its own disincentive as students understand that they will be held accountable for TTBHHPA behavior.
