The point here is that a school’s organization and committee structure should be aligned to effectively and efficiently accomplish the student, staff, school, and parent and community outreach goals identified on its annual SIP. While a school’s committee structure is generally reviewed every three to five years, it may need to be reconfigured if significant changes have occurred within the school that make the existing structure untenable or ineffective.

**CHARACTERISTICS OF EFFECTIVE COMMITTEES**

Beyond the existence of a logical and effective committee structure, committees still need to use sound leadership and collaborative practices that result in effective and efficient decisions and actions. And yet, few educators have ever been formally trained in these practices and processes. Below is a brief summary of some of the characteristics or processes that help committees to run smoothly and effectively.

**Effective Committee Processes. All committees**

- have representatives from every grade-level or instructional team (except for the SPRINT team) as well as from all relevant school-level and other support staff;
- are organized so that most staff members have staggered three-year terms of office;
- have a designated chair (or co-chairs) and a recorder who takes the minutes of all meetings;
- have a written mission, role, and function statement or document that is consistent with the school’s mission statement;
- have annual written goals and objectives that have been included in the annual SIP;
- meet at a fixed (whenever possible), predesignated time each month;
- have a set agenda that is consistent from month to month and a fluid agenda that may change, according to the committee’s goals or activities, from month to month;
