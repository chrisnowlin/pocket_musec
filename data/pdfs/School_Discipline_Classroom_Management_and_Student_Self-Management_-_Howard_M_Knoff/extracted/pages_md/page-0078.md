this institute, facilitators receive advanced training and responsibilities for the coming year in the wide range of PBSS components and activities.

# Implementation Year 3

During Implementation Year 3, the consolidation and institutionalization of different PBSS activities continues through the school discipline/PBSS committee and across the school’s staff. In addition, the PBSS facilitators continue to assume a more independent and leading role over the PBSS director (if one is present).

## Implementation Year 3 Activities

**Action 1.1: Training Selected Staff in Behavioral and Ecological Classroom Observation.** During the staff preparation days prior to the new school year, a select number of staff members are trained in behavioral and ecological classroom observation and how to functionally evaluate Instructional Environments and effective classroom instruction. Practice opportunities then are provided to this group during the first three months of the school year so that these staff members are available to provide these services during the last half of the school year.

**Action 1.2: Training Intervention and Other Support Staff in Consultation Processes.** During the staff preparation days prior to the new school year, the intervention specialists and other consultants working in the school are trained in consultation processes at the individual colleague, small group, and organizational levels. Practice opportunities then are provided to this group during the first three months of the school year so that these staff can integrate these processes into their day-to-day consultation interactions.

**Action 1.3: Continued Staff Training on Strategic Behavioral Interventions.** During the school year, the entire staff continues to participate in professional development activities focusing on the strategic, classroom-based behavioral interventions that can be applied and used with more challenging students (see *Chapter 9*).
