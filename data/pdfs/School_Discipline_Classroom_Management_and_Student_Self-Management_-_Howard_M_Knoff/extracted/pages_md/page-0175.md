- Grades 2 through 5 students taking the same test during the 1999 to 2000 school year also had a median percentile rank at the 43rd percentile—thus sustaining these academic improvements.
- In math, students taking the SAT-8 between 1993 and 1995 scored, on average, at the 29th percentile; the students taking the SAT-9 from 1995 to 1999 had a median percentile rank at the 51st percentile, and the students taking the same test during 1999 to 2000 had a median percentile rank at the 52nd percentile—the latter two cohorts both scoring above the national average and significantly higher than the 1993 to 1995 cohort.

## Special Education Outcomes

- Special education placements averaged 2.5 placements per 100 students for the first five years versus 1.6 placements per 100 students for the next two years.

# INTRODUCTION

Two special situations were introduced in Chapter 1 during the discussion outlining the primary components of the Positive Behavioral Support System (PBSS): setting-specific situations that occur in the common areas of the school (i.e., the cafeteria, hallways, bathrooms, buses, playgrounds, or gathering areas) and student-specific situations that involve teasing, taunting, bullying, harassment, hazing, and physical aggression. Relative to the first special situation, students’ social competency and self-management skills clearly contribute to the positive climate and safe interactions in the common areas of a school. This, in turn, helps students to positively and successfully enter their classrooms, settle in, and academically engage with their teachers and the learning process. Students’ social competency in the common areas also helps to minimize the negative peer interactions that form the foundation of teasing, taunting, bullying, harassment, hazing, and physical aggression—the second special situation (Knoff, 2009a).
