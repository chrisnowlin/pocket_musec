*Directions:* Below is a list, with brief descriptions, of a number of specialized classroom or school behavioral interventions. All SPRINT teams need to have consultants on (or available to) the team who are able to implement (and work with teachers to assist their implementation of) these interventions in the classroom with specific students. Please read the description of each intervention below and rate your ability to consult on and independently implement each intervention along the following scale:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Expert in Both Consultation & Implementation | Very Skilled in Both Consultation & Implementation | Skilled Only in Implementation | Questionable Even in Implementation | No Knowledge of Intervention |

| Rating | Intervention |
|--------|------------|
| | **Positive Reinforcement Schedules:** Understanding the types of positive reinforcement schedules (continuous versus intermittent; ratio versus variable) helps teachers to increase student responses for less and less reinforcement over time. |
| | **Extinction:** A procedure where inappropriate behavior that has been previously reinforced is no longer reinforced resulting in a decrease and then elimination of the behavior. |
