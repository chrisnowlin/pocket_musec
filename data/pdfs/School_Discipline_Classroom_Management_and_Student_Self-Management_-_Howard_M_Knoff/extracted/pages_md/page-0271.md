| Identified Problem | Problem Analysis: Most Likely Instructional Environment Reasons for the Identified Problem | Target: Instructional or Intervention Approach |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Problem #2. Speed of Acquisition Problem | There may be no problem here—that is, the student may be learning and mastering skills as quickly as he or she can | No intervention needed or possible |
| Problem #2. Speed of Acquisition Problem | Teacher or instruction: Teacher is not teaching the skills or behaviors effectively or modifying or differentiating them effectively for the student | Likely approach: Teacher consultation focusing on more effective instruction, or ways to modify or differentiate instruction for the student |
| Problem #2. Speed of Acquisition Problem | Curriculum: The curriculum does not provide sufficient pacing, is pacing the instruction too quickly, or is not well-matched to the needs or learning styles of the student | Likely approach: Adjusted curricular pacing, improved curriculum selection, differentiation, or modification |
| Problem #3. Transfer of Training or Generalization Problem | Student component: Student has not been taught how to transfer the initial skill instruction to applied situations or settings, or has missed this due to a history of absenteeism or excessive school and family moves | Likely approach: Including transfer of training instruction or repeating previous transfer of training instruction |
| Problem #3. Transfer of Training or Generalization Problem | Student is not attending or understanding during instruction, has a specific within-person challenge that is impeding learning, does not independently recognize situations or settings where skills should be transferred, or does not cognitively understand when to apply or transfer skills | Student-specific intervention to address the attentional or student-specific circumstances or instructional modification or accommodation<br><br>If the student does not have the cognitive understanding relative to the skills, there may be no student-specific intervention or teacher accommodation needed |
| Problem #3. Transfer of Training or Generalization Problem | Teacher or instruction: Teacher is not teaching the transfer of training skills or behaviors effectively or modifying or differentiating them effectively for the student | Likely approach: Teacher consultation focusing on more effective instruction, or ways to modify or differentiate instruction for the student |
