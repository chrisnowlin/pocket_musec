harassment, gang fights, a student or faculty member’s death, a hostage event) and complete the analyses and preparations that establish the procedures, training, and resources necessary to stop and stabilize these crises as they are developing or occurring (Trump, 2011). Schools and districts also need to prepare the crisis response services, supports, and strategies needed to address the security and social, emotional, and behavioral needs of everyone directly or indirectly involved or impacted by the crisis once it is over (e.g., Brock et al., 2009; Dwyer & Osher, 2000; Dwyer, Osher, & Warger, 1998).

Every school or district should have a written crisis management plan or EOP that summarizes all of its crisis preparation, intervention, and response system needs and efforts. Eventually, all of the preparation, training, and response protocols, with their related policies, procedures, and activities, should be compiled into an emergency operations handbook for use at the district and school levels. Some of the most important characteristics or elements of the plan and the handbook are listed below.

## The Plan or Handbook

- Is developed by a district team that includes representatives of its school discipline/PBSS committees or by an individual school discipline/PBSS committee
- Is reviewed and updated on an annual basis
- Is consistent with district, local, and state laws, policies, and procedures
- Establishes a well-coordinated emergency response process developed with and involving law enforcement, district and local emergency management personnel, fire and medical, and other first- and crisis-response agencies and entities
- Prepares the school to respond to natural disasters; transportation and other on-site accidents; acts of violence—especially those involving casualties and fatalities; power outage, fire, chemical, or biohazard incidents; bomb threats, hostage takings, and other intrusions; and other emergency events or circumstances
- Establishes lockdown, lockout, central location assembly, building and site evacuation (including reverse evacuation—outside-in), and weather-related (e.g., drop and cover, tornado, earthquake) procedures
