| Identified Problem | Problem Analysis: Most Likely Instructional Environment Reasons for the Identified Problem | Target: Instructional or Intervention Approach |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Problem #5. Motivational or Performance Deficit Problem | Curriculum: There is no emotional control instruction in the curriculum or instructional guidebook, or the recommended instruction is not well-matched to the needs or learning styles of the student | Likely approach: Improved curriculum selection, differentiation, or modification; adding the transfer of training instruction to the curriculum |
| Problem #5. Motivational or Performance Deficit Problem | Student component: Student is not motivated to demonstrate already-learned skills or behaviors | Likely approach: Motivational intervention (using either incentives or consequences) selected from the Behavioral Matrix (from the incentives and reward or classroom-based consequences boxes, respectively—see Figure 4.2 on page 80) |
| Problem #5. Motivational or Performance Deficit Problem | Student is not motivated due to competing incentives and consequences—for example, between the teacher and the peer group | Motivational intervention that differentially weights the respective incentives and consequences or that changes the messages from and motivations of the peer group |
| Problem #5. Motivational or Performance Deficit Problem | Teacher or instruction: Teacher has not identified meaningful incentives or consequences for the student, has not communicated them to the student, is not using them effectively or consistently, or is not holding the student accountable for appropriate behavior after inappropriate behavior has been demonstrated | Likely approach: Teacher consultation focusing on how to plan and accomplish these activities or tasks |
