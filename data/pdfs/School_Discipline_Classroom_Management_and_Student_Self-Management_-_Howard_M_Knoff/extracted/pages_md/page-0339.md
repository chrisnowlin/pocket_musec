Relative to use, the individual completing this classroom walk-through typically goes into the classroom and observes for 5 to 15 minutes. Because some teachers and students behave differently when an administrator or adult observer first enters a classroom, the first five minutes of the observation are not used in the evaluation, thereby allowing time to diminish any behavioral reactivity. After the observation, which may focus on one or more of the three areas above, the observer completes the ratings on the CWT protocol and describes any other relevant observations.
