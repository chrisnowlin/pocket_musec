| Identified Problem | Problem Analysis: Most Likely Instructional Environment Reasons for the Identified Problem | Target: Instructional or Intervention Approach |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| | Teacher or instruction: Teacher is not teaching the skills or behaviors for the special situation area or application effectively or modifying/differentiating them effectively for the student | Likely approach: Teacher consultation focusing on more effective instruction, or ways to modify or differentiate instruction for the student |
| | Curriculum: There is no skills instruction in the curriculum or instructional guidebook for the special situation area or application, or it is not well-matched to the needs or learning styles of the student | Likely approach: Improved curriculum selection, differentiation, or modification; adding the skills instruction to the curriculum |

The practice of writing a formal intervention plan prior to implementation occurs in most medical settings. Indeed, when complex or multifaceted interventions are needed in a hospital, a plan is written prior to treatment so that the medical, nursing, rehabilitation, dietary, social work, and other departments are all coordinated for the benefit of the patient and the amelioration of the medical problem. More important is the fact that we don’t want to undermine and lose the best and most powerful instructional or intervention approaches for a student because, for example, they were under-resourced, implemented inappropriately or inconsistently, or not implemented for a long or intense enough period of time.

Relative to the plan itself, effective intervention plans identify (a) the academic or behavioral goals or targets that will resolve or improve the student issues of concern; (b) the evidence-based instructional or intervention methods or approaches that will be used; (c) the people needed to directly or indirectly help implement or support the intervention process; (d) other needed financial, material, training, or technological resources; (e) the sequence of activities needed to fully implement the intervention from start to finish; (f) how implementation and treatment integrity and student (and other) outcomes will be formatively and summatively evaluated; (g) what short-term success will look like and how it will be formatively evaluated; and (h) what long-term success, related to the plan’s explicit goals or outcomes, will look like, and how it will be summatively evaluated. Once the plan has been written and approved, and once the
