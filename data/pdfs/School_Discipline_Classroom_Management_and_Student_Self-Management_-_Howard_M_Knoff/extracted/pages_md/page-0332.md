- The Evidence of Teacher’s Effective Classroom Management area (9 items) looks at whether teachers specifically identify their behavioral expectations for students in the classroom, and then monitor, evaluate, and reinforce students for appropriate or prosocial behavior while responding to and correcting inappropriate or antisocial behavior. Students’ academic engagement also is tracked here, as is the degree of respect demonstrated by teachers toward students.
- The Students’ Positive Behavioral Interactions and Respect area (9 items) looks at the degree to which students are positive, prepared, engaged, and on-task throughout a class period along with how well they interpersonally relate to peers and adults and treat them with respect.
- The Classroom Safety and Security area (5 items) looks at the organization and arrangement of a school’s classrooms, and whether emergency procedures are posted and can be physically and logistically followed.
