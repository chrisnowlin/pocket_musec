## Phase 1: At the Grade-Level Teams

This phase begins when all staff members receive the Behavioral Matrix forms and are asked to complete them independently and return them to their grade-level school discipline/PBSS committee representative by a specific date. These include separate forms for classroom expectations, incentives, Intensity I, II, and III inappropriate behaviors, and Intensity II and III consequences (see Figure 4.3 for some examples). Elective teachers (e.g., music, art, physical education, etc.) separate themselves across the different grade levels in the school, completing the matrix process as part of that team. Special education teachers and others are distributed more strategically across the grade levels.
