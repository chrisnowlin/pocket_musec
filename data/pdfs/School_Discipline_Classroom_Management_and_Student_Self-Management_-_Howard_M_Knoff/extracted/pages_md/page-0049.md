**Special Situations.** Two types of special situations are incorporated into the PBSS to prevent or respond to situations and circumstances that most often occur at the peer group and school levels: setting-specific situations that occur in the common areas of the school (i.e., the hallways, bathrooms, buses, playground, cafeteria, or gathering areas) and student-specific situations that include teasing, taunting, bullying, harassment, hazing, and physical aggression incidents (often involving antagonists, victims, and active or passive peer bystanders). In order to develop strategic interventions for these situations, the school discipline committee (see Chapter 3) is taught to functionally analyze the ecology and dynamics of these special situations using the following domains: (a) student characteristics, issues, and factors; (b) teacher/staff characteristics, issues, and factors; (c) environmental characteristics, issues, and factors such as the physical plant and logistics within the specific setting; (d) incentives and consequences; and (e) resources and resource utilization (see Chapter 6). For student-specific special situations, analyses of peer group characteristics, issues, and factors are added. This is needed because many teasing through physical aggression incidents occur in the common areas of a school, and they are often influenced, explicitly or implicitly, by peer bystanders (Bosworth, Espelage, & Simon, 1999; Pellegrini, Bartini, & Brooks, 1999; Rigby, 2000; see Chapter 7). Once again, the results of these ecological, data-based assessments are linked to specific interventions to maximize problem solutions and resolutions.

**Crisis Intervention and Response.** This area involves an initial needs assessment of a school staff’s ability to implement procedures to stop and stabilize situations during a crisis and then to address the security and social, emotional, and behavioral needs of students, staff, parents, and others after and in response to the crisis (Dwyer & Osher, 2000; Dwyer, Osher, & Warger, 1998). In the former area, schools and staff need to be prepared to address or de-escalate a wide variety of potential crisis situations as they are occurring (e.g., extreme weather conditions, racial harassment, gang fights, a faculty member’s death, a hostage event). In the latter area, crisis response supports and strategies are needed to address procedural, wellness, and mental health needs in the aftermath of the crisis (i.e., one hour, six hours, 24 hours, three days, one week, and one month after the event). These supports and services include the interventions
