whether other at-risk or struggling students, who have not yet been identified for the RTI² process, might benefit from one or more of the planned interventions. This is an important step in the RTI² process because some interventions, especially those that focus on teaching, practicing, and reinforcing specific academic or behavioral skills, can help other, at-risk students, thereby preventing their need for more intensive future interventions. This strategy also gives classroom teachers the opportunity to impact more students at one time, to implement more classwide rather than individualized approaches, and to see how specific interventions affect different types of students with separate but related needs.

# Step 7: Formative and Summative Evaluations of the Outcomes

The formative and summative evaluations for particular interventions are identified during Steps 5 and 6 of the RTI² process, and they have their roots in the assessment and hypothesis-testing activities in Step 4. Nonetheless, formative and summative evaluations are so important to determining the success of an intervention program that they require a step of their own.

While focused on determining the impact and success of those interventions directly targeting the initial student concerns, formative and summative evaluations also look more broadly at the entire intervention process. Indeed, formative and summative evaluations should address virtually every aspect of the intervention plan:

- The selection and training of individuals who will directly or indirectly help implement or support the intervention process
- The acquisition and use of financial, material, technological, or other needed resources
- The specificity and quality of the implementation sequence and timelines identified for the interventions
- The integrity of the intervention implementation and evaluation process
- The effectiveness of the interventions and their impact on desired or targeted student (and other) goals and outcomes
- The time, cost, and resource efficiency of the interventions
