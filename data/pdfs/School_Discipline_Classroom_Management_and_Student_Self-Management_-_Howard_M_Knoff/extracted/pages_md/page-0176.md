While special situations still tend to focus on student behavior, as noted in Chapter 1, they are special situations because there are other ecological factors that significantly contribute to positive and safe common school areas: the absence of teasing, taunting, bullying, harassment, hazing, and physical aggression and the presence of prosocial interactions and social competence. These domains are used to complete Special Situation Analyses—analyses that help to create the conditions that result in safe common school areas and peer interactions and that are used to systematically determine why a special situation problem is occurring so that strategic interventions can be identified, prepared, and implemented. These domains involve the following areas: (a) how students behave and interact together, and the degree of negative versus positive peer pressure (student characteristics, issues, and factors); (b) how staff interact with students (and each other), and the quality and quantity of staff supervision (teacher and staff characteristics, issues, and factors); (c) the physical plant of the school or a specific school area, the logistics of how students and staff physically interact and move from setting to setting, and how the school schedule impacts the logistics, number, and mix of students in specific school areas (environmental characteristics, issues, and factors); (d) the incentives and consequences in different common school areas relative to appropriate versus inappropriate student behavior, respectively; and (e) the availability and effective use of school resources to facilitate positive interactions, student management, and group self-management (resources and resource utilization).

This chapter focuses on setting-specific special situations at the prevention, problem solving, and crisis management levels (see Chapter 7 for the student-specific special situations). Relative to prevention, ways to organize schools, staff, and students such that common areas of the school are safe, secure, and prosocial are presented. Relative to problem solving, we review ways to conduct Special Situation Analyses that evaluate unsuccessful or unsafe common areas so that strategic or intensive interventions are identified and implemented. Relative to crisis management, the necessary components of an effective crisis management process are outlined. Within this chapter, ways to conduct safety audits, complete common school area screenings, and conceptualize an Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) also are addressed.
