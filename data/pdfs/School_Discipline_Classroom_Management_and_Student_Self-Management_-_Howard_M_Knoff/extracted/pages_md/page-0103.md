## Year-at-a-Glance Agenda for the Monthly SPRINT Team Meetings

Even though the building-level SPRINT team meets on a weekly basis to address new student cases and to review current student cases, the team also should devote part of one or more weekly meetings each month to the activities below. These activities help to maintain effective underlying SPRINT team processes, and they assist the team in making sure that annual goals, objectives, and outcomes are being evaluated on an ongoing and conscious basis.

During April: As needed, assign new SPRINT team members to the team for the next school year and choose a new team chair and secretary or recorder

During April–June: Hold at least six SPRINT team meetings with both outgoing team members and any incoming team members in attendance

During April–June: Conduct the various end-of-the-year articulation activities that help the team to plan for the transition to the new school year; one of the activities needs to focus on completing a summative evaluation of SPRINT goals, objectives, and outcomes written into the SPRINT section of the SIP Articulation activities needed:

- Complete and analyze the consultation referral audit
- Conduct a SPRINT forms analysis and update or prepare any needed forms
- Facilitate the Get-Go review process of the year’s early intervention referral, IEP, 504, and other students
- Participate in the academic achievement audit
- Facilitate the writing of the Student Briefing Reports

August staff preplanning time (the staff preparation days prior to the new school year): The SPRINT team should have its first team meeting
