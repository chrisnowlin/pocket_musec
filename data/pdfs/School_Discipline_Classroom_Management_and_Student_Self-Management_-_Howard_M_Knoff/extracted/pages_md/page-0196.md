- The staff members have not consistently taught, practiced (under conditions of emotionality), transferred, and held students accountable for (through consistently delivered incentives and consequences) the skill of excusing yourself when students are in a crowded hallway and need to get to their next destination quickly.
- The students exhibiting these behaviors know that certain teachers, who are supervising the hallways on specific days, will not stop and hold them accountable because (a) they need to start their own classes on time, (b) they do not want to waste or lose the time writing up students who are pushing in the hallway, (c) they know that nothing will happen to these students if they send them to the principal’s office, or (d) they know that they will need to supervise the students after school if the principal gives them after-school detention after the write-up.
- The administration has not allotted sufficient time for students to pass in the hallway, and those students with the furthest physical distance between their respective classrooms during certain periods feel that they need to push through other students in order to make it to the next class without a detention for being late.
- Specific students know that the hallway near the school’s gym area is unsupervised on those early afternoons when the coaches and sports teams are traveling to away games (and the hallway supervision has not been modified) such that they can get away with the inappropriate behavior most of the time.

Once again, in completing these data-based analyses, the outcomes may result in a conclusion that motivational factors are irrelevant to the inappropriate hallway behavior, or that these factors are secondary to other, more-primary conditions and domains. At the same time, it is important to note that, even when they are not primary or secondary causal factors, motivational factors still are important during the intervention process, for example, to motivate staff to implement the intervention with integrity, or to motivate the different groups of students to become involved in the intervention and its short- and long-term success.
