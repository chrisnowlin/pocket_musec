3. The *effective school, schooling, and professional development component* focuses on the evidence-based professional development, clinical supervision, and evaluation practices—at the system, school, staff, classroom, and student levels—that ensure effective and differentiated instruction and effective and positive behavior management exists in every classroom for every student. This involves creating a culture and planning and implementing the processes whereby everyone recognizes that professional development occurs, formally and informally, every day for every staff person. With a goal of increasing staff knowledge, enhancing instructional and intervention skills, and reinforcing confidence and independence, the essential processes are research and self-study, professional development and in-service instruction, clinical supervision and collegial consultation, and case study practice and application using peer mentoring and professional learning communities. Functionally, instructional and intervention knowledge is systematically linked to individuals through whole-staff skill, confidence, proficiency, and independence through (a) “master classes” with experts who demonstrate specific, targeted skills; (b) guided staff practice that includes planned applications, supervision, and informed feedback; and (c) the transfer of this training into more challenging settings and situations with additional supervision and evaluation. As with the other effective school and schooling components, professional development activities extend beyond those establishing effective classroom practices to those addressing the coordination and implementation of the tiered RTI² services, supports, strategies, and programs needed by students at more strategic or intensive levels.

4. The *academic instruction and intervention (or Positive Academic Supports and Services [PASS]) component* focuses on creating an effective Instructional Environment in every classroom within a school. The Instructional Environment consists of the interdependent interactions among teacher-instructional, student, and curricular processes in all classrooms. Expanding briefly, the Instructional Environment involves the integration of (a) the different academic curricula being taught in a classroom as well as their connection to state standards and benchmarks and district scope and sequence objectives (i.e., “What needs to be learned?”); (b) the teachers who are teaching these curricula and how they organize and
