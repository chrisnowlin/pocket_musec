| Identified Problem | Problem Analysis: Most Likely Instructional Environment Reasons for the Identified Problem | Target: Instructional or Intervention Approach |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Problem #6. Inconsistency Problem | Student component: Student has entered the classroom and its skill or behavioral instruction having already experienced inconsistency that is causing, for example, learning, transfer of training, motivational, or other gaps | Likely approach: History of inconsistency needs to be functionally assessed, and instructional or intervention approaches—at the instruction, transfer of training, or motivational levels—need to be consistently implemented for a time that exceeds the original levels of inconsistency |
| | Teacher or instruction: The teacher may be demonstrating inconsistency relative to skill instruction, prompting, transfer of training, the delivery of incentives or consequences, holding the student accountable across time, settings, circumstances, or situations | Likely approach: Inconsistency needs to be functionally assessed and teacher consultation provided focusing on the specific areas of inconsistency |
| | Curriculum: The instructional curriculum may not have any or sufficient approaches to facilitate or maintain instructional consistency in it, or its scope and sequence or curricular materials may be causing inconsistent instruction | Likely approach: Improved curriculum selection or modification; adding needed elements of instructional consistency to the curriculum |
| Problem #7. Special Situations Problem | Student component: The special situation area (e.g., one or more common school areas; teasing, taunting, bullying, harassment, hazing, physical aggression; or a student-specific home, community, or other situation or issue) needs to be identified and analyzed; and the presence of a student-specific learning, transfer of training, motivational, or other gap is identified | Likely approach: Instructional or intervention approaches—at the instruction, transfer of training, or motivational levels—need to be applied and implemented in the identified special situation area |
