# Introduction

*Classroom Music Games & Activities* is a collection created to help you teach music basics whether you have a music degree or no formal music training. Students will listen closely, identify musical notation and terms, recognize instruments, and more!

Keep your students engaged with the material. Bring out their creative side when they create their own dance At the Hop, come up with a School Spirit song, and design an Album of the Year based on a musical style of their choice. Reinforce lessons from other subjects with the activities that provide cross-curricular elements, such as language arts and critical thinking. As students begin to grasp the basics, you can move on to activities that are more difficult or adapt the activities to include new material. Students will continue to be challenged throughout the year!

## WHOLE-CLASS ACTIVITIES

Get your students’ attention and keep them on the same page by using activities for the whole class. These activities are easy to organize and require few, if any, additional materials. Some activities include game cards that can be reproduced on card stock and even laminated to reduce wear and tear; it will also save you the time of having to copy them again for future games. Many of them can be played for multiple rounds to further increase their educational value.

## SMALL GROUP ACTIVITIES

Group and partner activities can be used to build cooperation and teamwork within your classroom. Putting students together that may not know each other very well and encouraging them to get to know their classmates can strengthen interpersonal communication skills, classroom cooperation, and perhaps even spark a new friendship. Use these activities multiple times and for multiple rounds to further increase their educational value.

## INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITIES

Use the reproducible worksheets to let students work and learn on their own. Many of the worksheets include all of the information the students need, such as terms, definitions, symbols, and biographies. Others will ask students to use the knowledge they already have and can be used to assess how well individuals understand the material.

The activities in this book can get your students up and moving or provide them with fun ways to work at their desks. Either way, their creativity and music knowledge will grow. Mix and match whole-class, group, and individual activities to create entertaining lesson plans, and watch as your students have a blast and reinforce music basics!

# The Name Game

In this exercise, students will create interesting rhythmic patterns by using their own names. Say your name out loud for the class, clapping each syllable. For example:

Say:          Miss – us Al – ex – an – der  
Clap (x):     x    x x  x    x    x

Have your students say and clap your name back to you.

Have each student say and clap his or her name. Have the class echo each student by saying and clapping that student’s name in exactly the same way. After each student has “performed” his or her name, discuss the following:

1. Who had the longest name with the most claps?
2. Who had the shortest name with the least number of claps?

Use the following ideas to continue the game after all of the students have said and clapped their own names:

1. Pick your favorite sports figure, and say and clap his or her name.
2. Pick your favorite TV or movie star, and say and clap his or her name.
3. Pick a mystery person. Give a clue about this person, then only clap his or her name (don’t say the name out loud). See if the class can guess the person’s name.

For example:  
Clue:         A kindly president with a beard who often wore a tall, black hat  
Clap:         x x  x  x  x  
Answer:       Abraham Lincoln

# Classmate M-U-S-I-C

Reproduce one copy of the grid on the next page. Fill the center of each square with a musical skill (see below for suggestions). Be sure to leave the bottom line in each square blank. Reproduce enough completed grids for each student, and pass them out to the class. The object of the game is for the students to collect one signature of a classmate that can complete that skill in each square.

Allow the students to have plenty of time to mingle and find classmates to sign their grids. Have students gather enough signatures to fill the entire grid or just enough to make a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line. If possible, students should not have the same classmate sign their grids more than once. Show the students an example of the grid so they can see what they are trying to achieve. The first student to get enough names is the winner! Make yourself available to answer any of the students’ questions (“Is this answer correct?,” “Do I have enough signatures?”).

## BACK TO SCHOOL

At the beginning of the school year, fill the center of each square with a musical skill that students may have when starting the class (examples are given below). You can make a board unique to your class by asking students what musical talents they have and using those answers to create the board.

| Plays an instrument<br>Katie | Can whistle<br>Matthew | Sings in a choir<br>Erica | Can beatbox<br>Nicholas | Listens to classical music<br>Brian |
|------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Has taken a dance class<br> | Wants to be in a band<br>Jamie | Can do the Twist<br> | Can hum the theme song to a game show<br> | Takes piano lessons<br>Megan |

## SHOW WHAT YOU KNOW

Throughout the school year, test students’ knowledge by playing Classmate M-U-S-I-C again. Fill the center of each square with an academic skill from a recent lesson or subject in class (examples are listed in the box below).

| Can name two string instruments<br>Bradley | Can draw a quarter note<br> | Knows two music styles<br> | Can draw a treble clef<br>Kylie | Can explain what a conductor does<br>Elliot |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Can name the notes on the staff<br> | Knows what ♩ means<br>Jennifer | Can demonstrate pianissimo<br> | Knows three brass instruments<br> | Knows four instrument families<br>Sarah |

# My Favorite Musician

Have students show their appreciation for their favorite musicians or bands by creating a fact basket in their honor!

Each student will need:
- A piece of 11" x 17" paper
- A 1" x 17" strip of paper
- Markers, crayons, or colored pencils
- Scissors
- A glue stick
- Magazines from which to cut images and words
- A blank sheet of paper

Show students how to create the basket and then let them create their own! Be available in case students need assistance creating their baskets.

First, cut a piece of 11" x 17" paper in half, long ways, to create two strips that are each 5 1/2" x 17". Then, fold each piece in half widthwise. Lay one piece on top of the other so they line up exactly, and round off the corners of the open end with scissors.

Open the two pieces and lay them one on top of the other, so they form an X. Fold up the lower half of the bottom strip, place a little glue on the strip you just folded, and then fold up the lower half on the top piece. Turn over the basket and glue those sides together. Be careful not to glue the basket closed.

Have students write their names on one side of the 1" x 17" strip. Then, attach it to their baskets to create a handle. (Be sure they attach it name-side down.) Now their baskets are ready to decorate!

Students should think about their favorite musician or band. Have them cut the blank piece of paper into small pieces and write a fact about the musician or band on each strip. Then, have students color the basket with crayons or markers, or glue on words or pictures they cut out of magazines. When they are done decorating the baskets, they can place the facts into it.

When the baskets are finished, display them in your classroom. Ask the students to guess their classmates’ favorite musicians and bands from the facts in the baskets.

8 Whole-Class Activities 90/1098LE

# At the Hop

Recreate a sock hop by playing a few songs from the early rock era (such as *The Twist* and *Jailhouse Rock*). Find examples of classic dance moves, such as the Mashed Potato and the Sprinkler, on the Internet, teach them to the class, and have a dance contest.

The students can then form small groups and create a dance about something in their daily lives to another song from the 1950s and 60s or to a song from today. For example, the School Bus could start with a walk forward (the movement of the bus) followed by the extension of the right arm (the bus’s stop sign being released).

# Draw the Music

Play a recording of a selected piece of music that does not have any lyrics (or has lyrics in a different language). Classical, jazz, bluegrass, new age, and opera are all great music styles to choose from, and many free clips can be found on the Internet. Feel free to choose any piece of music, but do not tell your students the name of the chosen piece. Play the recording for your students. As the music plays, challenge the students to sit quietly and listen to it carefully.

Provide each student with a piece of paper and drawing materials. As they listen through the music a second time, have the students draw the picture that the music creates in their minds. What do they think of when they hear the music? Does the music remind them of a certain time or place? Have each student present his or her drawing and explain it to the class. At the end of the activity, tell the students the name of the selected music.

90/1098LE Whole-Class Activities 9

# Action!

Play any piece of music while the students dance around the room. Ask students to move slowly when the music is quiet and quickly when it is loud. Start the music at a low volume, and have the students begin dancing slowly around the room. As the students dance and the song plays, adjust the volume and watch as the students change speed.

Once they have mastered the changes in volume, ask them to show how the music makes them feel as they dance around. For example, if the music is fast and upbeat, they should move quickly. If it is slow and soft, they should move slowly. Upbeat music may make them jump up high, while soft music may make them move closer to the ground. Let them be creative and show off their moves!

# Follow the Leader. . . Sometimes

Begin this alternative version of Simon Says by gathering students where they can easily see you. Make sure the students have enough space to move. Say the name of a musical instrument, and act out how the instrument would be played. Have the students “play” the instrument with you.

Continue naming instruments and acting them out. Then, name an instrument, but act out a completely different instrument. The students that “play” the instrument incorrectly with you are out. See how many students you can confuse with your acting ability!

10 Whole-Class Activities 90/1098LE

# Character Connections

Collect a variety of small percussion instruments (one for each student), and select a story to read aloud to the class. If you do not have percussion instruments, you can use body percussion or found sounds (tapping a pen on a table, shaking a can with pennies in it, etc.).

Divide the class into groups, assign each a character in the story, and assign a percussion instrument or sound for each character. For example:

**Story:**  
Cinderella  

**Characters:**  
Cinderella, Stepmother, Stepsisters, Fairy Godmother, Prince  

**Instruments:**  
- Cinderella – finger cymbals/clap hands  
- Stepmother – egg shaker/snap fingers  
- Stepsisters – rhythm sticks/stomp feet  
- Fairy Godmother – woodblock/tap fingers  
- Prince – triangle/whistle  

> **Note:** If possible, assign a sound that matches the character’s personality or actions in the story.

Read the story aloud to the class and have each group play their instruments when their assigned character is mentioned. Be sure to allow time in your reading for the instruments to be played.

# That’s Debatable

Pretend that the class is creating a TV show for the classroom, and they need to decide on theme music. Select a recording of your choice, and play it for the class.

Divide the class into two teams. Assign one team to argue in favor of using the recording (the “pro” side) and the other team to argue against using the recording (the “con” side). Play the recording again. Then, give the teams time to discuss their arguments with their teammates, reminding them that they will be expected to use their music vocabulary.

After the teams have had time to work on their arguments, set up the classroom with one team on one side of the room and the other team on the opposite side. Let the teams debate the issue in an orderly way, making sure students raise their hands and only one person speaks at a time. The students should use as many music terms in their arguments as possible. The most convincing team is the winner!

Help students learn to argue their points and use music vocabulary by keeping the debate going throughout the year. Select different recordings to use as a classroom theme, or change the scenario. Would this be a good theme for the class? For the school? For a cartoon? For a comedy? For an action movie?

90/1098LE  Whole-Class Activities  11

# Story Soundtrack

Movies and television shows have soundtracks with a variety of music and sounds. The music varies depending on what is occurring in the story at the time.

Choose a short story that includes changes in pacing or mood with both good and evil characters. Read it by yourself and determine sounds or music clips that would go well with different parts of the story. Mark some of them before the part in the story and others after the part in the story.

Explain to students that you have created a soundtrack for the story you are about to read. For parts that you have found an appropriate clip or sound for, play it as you read. After a clip is played, ask the students:

- Do you think the sound belongs to what just happened or what is about to happen?

For sound clips that belong to what just happened, ask the following questions:

- How does the sound make you feel about what happened?
- What are some other sounds that you would use here instead?
- Can you think of any songs that could be used?

For clips that belong to what is about to happen, ask the following questions:

- What do you think will happen next?
- Who do you think will be involved?
- How does the soundtrack affect your emotions? Does it make you scared or excited for what could happen?

> **Note:** Answers to these questions will vary.  
Encourage students to discuss the various ideas and come to a conclusion before continuing.

12  Whole-Class Activities  90/1098LE

# Follow the Conductor

Begin the activity by defining and discussing the role of the conductor. A conductor is the leader of an orchestra or band. He or she helps all the musicians not only stay together and play on the same beat, but the conductor also leads the musicians to play with the same musical expressions.

Ask your students if they’ve ever seen a conductor conduct before. You may want to find a clip of a conductor, such as Gustavo Dudamel, in action and show it to the class. What did they notice?

The conductor uses his or her hands, arms, whole body, and even facial expressions to convey to the orchestra how a piece should be played. Sometimes the conductor uses a baton. He or she cues the orchestra when to come in, how fast or slow to play, how softly or loudly to play, when to slow down a little, when to speed up, or when to cut off (stop playing). Their gestures can also convey to the orchestra how to create a certain musical mood with their playing—perhaps dreamy, perhaps exciting, perhaps playful and a little silly.

Using the song “Row, Row, Row Your Boat,” guide the students through this introduction to conducting:

1. First, have the entire class sing the song together. As they sing the song, conduct them at a familiar and moderate speed.
2. Now tell the class to watch you very closely. They need to become the “orchestra” as you conduct them in a very slow version of the song. Tell them to picture themselves trying to row a small boat against a very strong current. Just as the boat would move slowly against the current, the song will move slowly as well. As they sing, conduct the piece very slowly and broadly.
3. Have them watch you again as you conduct the piece at a very fast, but still singable tempo. This time they can imagine themselves guiding a speed boat in a race and winning first place.
4. Now they must watch you even more closely because the boat will vary in speed throughout the song. Conduct the piece, speeding up and slowing down as you go.
5. Ask for a student volunteer to conduct the class. Whisper to him or her the “Top-Secret Musical Instructions.” Tell the student to conduct the piece so that their performance will be very quiet and steady and see if the class can follow their gestures. Ask for additional volunteers and have them conduct the song with long pauses between each phrase.

Students may also create and conduct their own musical version of the song or choose another familiar tune to test their conducting skills with the class.

90/1098LE Whole-Class Activities 13

# What’s the Order?

Divide the class into groups of four to eight students. Have each group create a rhythm using notes and rests that they have already learned. These could include, but are not limited to, the following:

The rhythms should use the same number of symbols as students in a group. Once a rhythm has been created, each symbol should be written on a separate piece of paper.

Select one group to begin the game. Have each student hold one of the group’s symbols and line up next to each other at the front of the room in the order of their rhythm.

Give the rest of the class a few seconds to study the order in which the group has lined up. Then, have the class clap the rhythm together.

Now, have the selected group go out into the hallway and rearrange the order in which they are standing. When the group is ready, bring them back into the classroom. Have the rest of the students try to put the group back in its original order using musical vocabulary words. Encourage the students to raise their hands, and select one student to give a direction:

“The quarter note should be before the whole note.”  
“The quarter rest should be last.”

> Note: If some of the symbols are used more than once, only the symbols need to be in the correct order, not the people holding the symbols.

After the correct rhythm has been restored, allow one member of the first group to choose the next group to line up.

To make this activity more challenging, when the group goes into the hallway, have them trade symbols rather than just rearrange themselves. This way, the students have to pay attention to the order of the notes and rests rather than the people.

1. Jar of salsa/picante sauce (salsa)
2. Large stone (rock)
3. Several blue items (blues)
4. Polka-dotted fabric (polka)

# Music Mind Benders

*Easy*

Getting your students excited about class can be a difficult task. How do you motivate them to buckle down and focus on the daily activities? Begin the class or rehearsal with a brain-stretching logic puzzle or wheel-turning brainteaser. Solve the problem as a whole class, allowing students to provide ideas and work out the problems together.

There are three pages with mind benders. The first page is the easy level, the second page is the medium level, and the third page is the hard level. Answers are provided at the back of the book, but let your students be creative; they may find other answers that work.

1. I occur once in an orchestra, twice in a jazz band, and never in a woodwind quintet. What am I?
2. Rearrange the letters in **WONDROUS MICE** to make one music word.
3. If it takes one flute player seven minutes to play a particular piece of music, how long will it take 10 flute players to play the same piece of music?
4. Elizabeth watched the man in front of her intently. The man was holding a long stick and was waving it around. Elizabeth herself was holding two sticks, both of which were bigger than the one being waved at her by the man. Yet Elizabeth followed the man’s every direction, not daring to disobey him. Who was this man?
5. Andy was competing in a guitar-playing contest against several other students from schools around the state. On his turn, he stepped up to the microphone and played a short, fast rock-and-roll piece. The judges gave him a score that put him in third place. On his next turn, Andy played a smooth jazz piece that wowed the judges. His new score allowed him to overtake the guitarist in second place. In what place was Andy now in?

# Music Mind Benders

## Medium

1. Typically, the rehearsal comes before the performance, and the performance will be followed by an encore. In what place does rehearsal come after performance and encore?

2. Four members of the band’s woodwind section are sitting in a circle to begin tuning. Using the clues below, figure out whether Christine, Ben, Dora, or Dylan plays the oboe.
   - In the circle, the two boys sit directly across from each other.
   - Dora’s instrument does not require a reed.
   - The person sitting to the left of Dylan plays an instrument that begins with the same letter as her first name.
   - The person sitting across from Ben plays the saxophone.

3. Jimmy works at a music store. In one shipment he receives three boxes of mouthpieces, labeled **TUBA MOUTHPIECES**, **TRUMPET MOUTHPIECES**, and **TUBA AND TRUMPET MOUTHPIECES**, respectively. He knows that all of the boxes are incorrectly labeled. Jimmy needs to fix the labels and can pick only one mouthpiece from one box. Which box should he pick from and how will he know how to correctly label the boxes?

4. The crazy new orchestra director has mixed up all of the instruments and put them in new sections. In the new orchestra:
   - Clarinets are found in the brass section
   - Violins are found in the percussion section
   - Tubas are found in the woodwind section
   - Flutes are found in the brass section
   - Snare drums are found in the string section

   In this new orchestra, where are the cellos found?

# Music Mind Benders

## Difficult

1. A young apprentice slowly approached the great songwriter, who was writing furiously on the paper in front of him. The apprentice said, “Excuse me, sir, but we need to be leaving for the performance now.” The songwriter, still scribbling away, said, “No, no, I need it much louder.” The apprentice, slightly confused, hesitated a moment before shouting, **“EXCUSE ME, SIR, BUT WE NEED TO BE LEAVING FOR THE PERFORMANCE NOW!”** The songwriter was so startled by his apprentice that he nearly fell out of his chair.

   If the songwriter asked the apprentice to be louder, why was he so surprised?

2. Use the following facts to determine a common musical term:
   - The word HATS has one of the same letters, and it is in the correct place in the word.
   - The word NAIL has one of the same letters, and it is also in the correct place.
   - The word HOPE has two of the same letters, both of which are in the correct place.
   - The word CASH has none of the same letters as the word.

   What is the term?

3. Eliza and her sister decided to drive to Winnipeg, Canada to hear a popular blues group perform in concert. They lived in Seattle, Washington, and thought it would be best to drive north into Canada and then head directly east to Winnipeg. Eliza knew that the speed limits around Seattle were 70 miles per hour, but she was very surprised to see that in Canada, the speed limits were posted at 90! A little hesitant to drive so quickly, Eliza set the cruise control at 75 miles per hour. They had plenty of time to get to the concert hall, so she was not worried.

   After about half an hour on the road in Canada, Eliza noticed the flashing lights of a police car pulling her over. The police officer approached her vehicle, and Eliza explained that she thought the speed limit in that area was 90. He said that she was correct, but he gave her the ticket anyway. Why?

More mind benders are available in *Music Mind Benders*, Heritage Music Press, 2009.

# We Go Together

Make enough copies of the instrument or notation cards on the following pages so that each student in your class will get one card. Mix up the cards and pass out one to each student. The object of the game is for the students to group themselves together according to the pictures on their cards. Announce the groups that they are to form (suggested groups are listed below). When everyone has found a place, ask the students in each group to name the instruments on their cards.

## Suggested Groupings:
- Strings/Percussion/Wind
- Brass/Woodwinds
- Played with a Bow/Plucked
- Reed/No Reed
- Slide/Valves
- Notes/Rests
- Line Notes/Space Notes

> **Note:** For some of these suggestions, not all of the cards will belong in the given groups. In these cases, take one of the following steps:
> - Collect the cards and pass out only the ones that will apply to the next grouping.
> - Create another group to be included.

You can also use this activity to incorporate the use of Venn diagrams into your lesson. Place several pairs of hula-hoops or taped circles on the floor in the pattern of a simple Venn diagram. Designate each hoop as a particular category, and have the students physically form the Venn diagrams by separating into the hoops according to the cards.

# M-U-S-I-C

Write each music term below on a separate piece of paper and place it into a hat or bowl. You may want to replace terms that younger students do not know or add terms that older students have learned. If possible, find sound clips to represent any instruments you have used. Have the clips ready when you begin the game.

- Accordion
- Bell
- Cello
- Chimes
- Clarinet
- Crescendo
- Decrescendo
- Eighth notes
- Flat
- Flute
- Gong
- Guitar
- Half note
- Metronome
- Piano
- Quarter note
- Saxophone
- Sharp
- Snare drum
- Staff
- Triangle
- Trombone
- Trumpet
- Tuba
- Violin
- Whistle
- Whole note
- Xylophone

Print out enough copies of the M-U-S-I-C board on page 7 for each student to have one. Have each student mark the center space as “Rest.” They should draw a rest symbol and write the word on the blank. This will be a free space.

Then, have the students fill in their M-U-S-I-C boards with the music terms you placed in the hat. Each box should have one word written on the blank (not all terms will be used). Students should also draw the term they have selected in the box (if possible).

Provide the students with a handful of small candies, paper clips, or other markers.

Pull a term out of the hat. Then, call out the term, play its sound clip, or show the students an image of it. Have the students mark off each term as it comes up. The first student to get five terms in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) is the winner!

# Partner and Group Selection for Small Group Activities

The following activities require partners or groups. Choosing partners and groups for these activities is very important. Putting students together that would not normally associate with each other is a great way for them to get to know the other members of their class. Be sure to use a selection method that will combine students in a non-biased manner.

This method is sure to integrate your student groups and will let them have a little fun at the same time. Have the class line up according to any of these parameters:

1. Alphabetical by last name
2. Alphabetical by first name
3. Birth date
4. Height
5. Alphabetical by the name of the street on which they live
6. Numerical order by street address
7. Numerical order by last four digits of their phone number
8. Numbers drawn from a hat

Feel free to choose your own criteria, but keep in mind that separating students by reasons such as gender or ethnicity could have a negative impact on the groups and should be avoided.

After the students are lined up according to the selected criteria, have each student count off in the number of desired groups. For example, if you would like the class to be divided into five groups, the first student in the row would say “One” aloud, followed by the second student with “Two,” etc. After the fifth student says “Five,” the counting starts over again with the next student saying “One.” Continue counting until all students have a number. Students with the same number will make up a group.

Other ideas for making groups can be found on the next page. They can also be used as class activities.

90/1098LE Small Group Activities 23

# Getting into Groups

## ANIMAL NOISES

As people arrive, give each student a slip with an animal’s name on it, or whisper it in his or her ear. Use as many different animals as you need teams. Tell everyone to make the animal sound at the same time. Students must try to find the others in their group just by following the sounds.

## BIRTHDAYS

Tell everyone to find all the other people who have the same birth month. (It can get loud at this point!) When it seems that most people have found their groups, call out “Where is the group with the January birthdays?” Continue with each month of the year until you have all of the months that are represented. Do this to make sure that all groups are together and not fragmented.

Instruct each group to make up a song (15 to 30 seconds long) that represents their shared birth month. Allow no more than five minutes for this. Have each group present the results of their teamwork.

## HUMDINGERS

Determine how many teams you need. Give each player a strip of paper that has a childhood song on it, or you can whisper the name of the song in each person’s ear. Some examples are “Happy Birthday,” “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” “Row, Row, Row Your Boat,” and “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.” Everyone hums or sings his or her song and forms a group with all people that have the same song. Use this to get groups together for a game, or make it into a game and the first team to have all of its members together wins.

# Breath Control

Breath control is necessary for singers and for musicians who play wind instruments. It lets them sing or play for short or long periods, to raise and lower their volume, and to time taking breaths between words or notes.

Clear plenty of space on the floor in the classroom. Divide the class into groups of at least four students, and distribute the groups in various places in the room. In each group’s area, mark the ground with two long strips of masking tape three to four feet apart (it may be beneficial to do this before class begins). Divide each group into two smaller groups, and have each small group kneel down behind one of the tape strips.

Student  
Student  
Student  
Tape Strip/Goal Line  
Tape Strip/Goal Line  
Ping-Pong Ball  
Student  
Student  
Student  

Place a ping-pong ball, small balloon, or other lightweight object within the tape strips. Signal the players to start blowing the items across the other team’s “goal line.” Players cannot use their hands or cross the goal line with their knees. When a goal is scored, place the object back within the tape strips. The side scoring the most goals in five minutes is the winner. This game may also be played with the entire class in two groups.

# School Spirit

Nations around the world have a national anthem, or song. It typically describes the history and traditions of the nation and its people. Many states also have an official song. Your school may even have its own song!

Talk about the purpose of a national anthem or school song. Have the students heard any before? Do they know the national anthem? Play a variety of national anthems and school songs. You may want to provide a page with lyrics for each group or student (“The Star-Spangled Banner” and “O, Canada” are provided on the next two pages).

What types of characteristics would students want other people to hear about when listening to a song for their own school? Talk about the history, events, or characteristics that could be included, such as when the school was established, the school mascot, classroom subjects, etc.

Let your students’ school spirit shine by having them create their own school song. Divide the class into teams, and provide each team with markers and large sheets of paper. If your school already has a song, share it with the class. You can then have the students write a new verse for the song, or have them write a song about your class.

Ask students to write the song so that it can be hung on the wall. If there is time, have them illustrate their song lyrics on the paper as well. After all teams have finished their songs, display them around the room. Give each team a chance to present and explain their song to the rest of the class.

**"The Star-Spangled Banner"**

*Francis Scott Key*

O say can you see by the dawn’s early light,  
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming,  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,  
O’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?  
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,  
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;  
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave,  
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

# Who's Who at the Zoo?

Begin a discussion about the ways music can often capture the images and sounds of familiar things, such as a stormy night, a spring day, or even animals in nature. Ask the students, “If you were a composer and you were going to compose a song about fish in the seas, how would that music sound? Would it be loud and fast, or flowing and perhaps soft? Could it be suddenly playful, like a fish jumping around and skipping with the waves?”

Divide the class into small groups. In a container, place the following animal names on separate folded sheets of paper:

ELEPHANT, MONKEY, GIRAFFE, LION, BIRD, SWAN, SEAL, BEAR

Have each group pick one animal and answer the following questions. If possible, have one student take notes for the group.

1. What noise, if any, does my animal make? A roar? A chirp? A unique sound?
2. Is the noise loud or soft?
3. Is the noise long or short, or a quick, repeated pattern?
4. Is the noise a high or low sound – or somewhere in between?
5. Is my animal big, medium-sized, or small?
6. Is my animal fast or slow-moving?
7. Where does my animal live? In big, broad spaces? In the trees? In the water?

Now ask the students to imagine they are composing a piece about their animal. Ask them to answer the following questions:

1. Would my piece be mostly loud or soft?
2. Would my piece be mostly fast, slow, or at a medium speed?
3. Would my piece be playful, dreamy, mysterious, or even scary?

Ask your students to title their song to match the musical picture they would like to paint. For example:  
*The Laughing Monkeys, Elephant Safari, The Bellow of the Bear*

**BONUS ACTIVITY**

Play a recording for the class of Camille Saint-Saëns’s *Carnival of the Animals*. Ask them to draw a picture of the animal they imagine as they listen to each musical selection.

This can also be paired with the *Carnival of the Animals* Seek and Find on pages 72–73.

# Found Sounds

This activity helps students practice their listening skills by using items commonly found in the classroom or around the home.

Divide the class into teams, and have each team sit together, facing in one direction, with their eyes closed. Stand behind the students, and make a sound with your first sound-maker (see below for suggestions). Hide the sound-maker, and have students open their eyes. Encourage the teams to talk about the sound they heard and determine how it was produced. Allow each team one guess; each correct guess is awarded a point. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins!

**Suggested Sound-Makers**  
- Shaking coins in a can  
- Snapping a rubber band  
- Flipping the pages of a book  
- Scraping fingernails on a chalkboard  
- Squeaking a marker on a shiny surface  
- Typing on a keyboard  

# Using Your Senses

Before the activity, fill a bag with fairly common musical items that have different textures.

**Suggested Items**  
- Instrument mouthpiece  
- Reed  
- Tuning fork  
- Mallets/drumsticks  
- Guitar pick  
- Whistle  
- Egg shaker  
- Recorder  

Divide the class into groups of two to three. Take the mystery bag to each team, and have all students in that team reach in and feel as many items as they can. After all groups have had a chance to explore the bag, take turns asking each team for one item that they thought was in the bag. After a few rounds of guessing, reveal the contents of the mystery bag.

# Listen Carefully

Teams of students need to listen carefully to various songs to identify musical instruments and win points in this activity.

Divide the class into small teams. Play a short song, or part of a song. Instruct the teams to listen carefully and try to pick out as many instruments as possible. After the song has ended, have students raise their hands and identify as many different instruments as they heard. Each correct guess receives one point for the team.

Students can also enjoy this activity with clips that demonstrate only one instrument at a time. Play a sound, and have team members work together to identify the instrument. Each correct answer receives a point, and the team with the most points at the end of the game is the winner!

After guesses have been made, play each song again and discuss them with the class. Encourage students to think about the songs by asking questions:
- Is it loud or soft?
- Is it fast or slow?
- Is it high or low?
- When might you hear it?
- How does it make you feel?

As an alternative to songs, have the students listen to various sound effects to identify sounds and win points. Inexpensive sound effects CDs can be found at electronics stores and discount stores. You may even have one left over from a school play!

90/1098LE Small Group Activities 31

# Splat!

Gather a variety of sound clips that represent a musical instrument. Find the instruments in the game cards from *We Go Together* on page 20 or *My Many Musical Hats* on page 45, or create your own cards. Tape each card to the board or to a blank wall in a random fashion. Make sure the cards are at least a few inches apart. Also, create a place on the board to keep score for each team.

Divide the class into teams of four to five, and provide each team with a fly swatter. Tape a line on the floor for each team to gather around, but make sure these lines are equally close to the cards. Have each team select a person to hold the fly swatter first.

Play a sound clip from your collection. Each team decides which instrument the sound clip came from, and the team member holding the fly swatter runs to the cards and SPLATs the correct instrument with the fly swatter. The first team to SPLAT! the correct answer gets a point. Then, have the students with the fly swatter pass it to a teammate, and begin a new round. The team with the most points when all of the clips have been played is the winner!

For younger students, write the numbers 1–9 on index cards. Have the students maintain a steady beat by marching in place. Clap a rhythm with no more than nine beats. Each team decides how many beats were in the given rhythm, and the team member holding the fly swatter runs to the cards and SPLATs the correct number.

For older students, write the names of composers on index cards. Give the students a fact about a composer. Each team decides which composer the fact belongs to, and the team member holding the fly swatter runs to the cards and SPLATs the correct person. For ideas of composers or facts to use, look at the following activities: *La Mer*, *Carnival of the Animals*, *Composer Connect the Dots*, *A Very Verdi Day*, *Can You Handel It?*, *Musician Portrait Gallery*, and *Crack the Code*.

# Creative Symbols

Divide the class into groups, and provide each group with crayons, markers, or colored pencils. Post a large sheet of paper for each group at various places in the room. (You can also use the chalkboard, or give each group a sheet of paper to put on the floor.)

Using a large black marker, draw a music symbol on each group’s paper (some symbol suggestions are listed below). Draw the same symbol on every group’s paper. Talk about the symbol with the students—what does it mean? When is it used?

Give each group five minutes to draw a picture that uses the symbol you have provided.

You may want to do a quick example drawing to help the students get started. The group can draw any picture they choose, but they must work together on the same paper. At the end of the five minutes, have each group present their picture to the rest of the class.

## Suggested Symbols:

- Notes (eighth, quarter, half)
- Rests (quarter, half, whole)
- Treble Clef
- Bass Clef
- Flat
- Sharp
- Natural

# How to SUDOKU!

Sudoku puzzles can be a lot of fun. The rules are simple, but the puzzles are challenging. Keep the symbols straight, and you will be successful.

The easiest kind of Sudoku puzzle is the 4x4 grid.

Here are a few things to know about doing a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle:

- Each row must have four different symbols in the boxes (in this case, the symbols will be ♪, ♩, ♫, and ♫). Each row can only have one of each symbol in it.

AND

- Each column must have the symbols ♪, ♩, ♫, and ♫ in the boxes. Each column can only have one of each symbol in it.

AND

- Each small grid must have the symbols ♪, ♩, ♫, and ♫ in the boxes. Each small grid can only have one of each symbol in it. (You can see the small grids because they have a dark outline.)

Put all of these rules together to fill out your Sudoku grid! Some puzzles might be bigger than 4x4. You can still use the same rules for these puzzles.

Sometimes you might get stumped on a puzzle. To help get back on track, look for a row, column, or grid that has many symbols already filled in. Look at the symbols, and see what is still missing:

The top row of this grid already has the symbols ♩, ♪, and ♫. What’s missing?

That’s right – the symbol ♪! Fill it in, and then do it again!

# Hit the Note

Your teacher will assign partners. Find your partner, and sit facing him or her. Hide your paper behind a folder or other object so your partner cannot see it.

Now place five notes on the first music staff (one in each measure). They can be space notes or line notes. An example is below.

Take turns "searching" for notes. The person searching for a note will ask a question such as "Do you have an E in the first measure?" If that note is in the measure, the person says, "You hit the note!" If that note is not in the measure, the person says, "You missed the note!" If you hit a note, mark it down on the second staff. Make sure to mark where the note does not exist as well so you don't guess the same one twice!

The first player to find all five of his or her partner's notes is the winner!

90/1098LE Small Group Activities Reproducible 37

# Pin the Note on the Staff

This activity will give your students practice with both the placement of notes on the musical staff and spelling.

Divide the class into multiple teams, and provide each team with tape and a copy of the next page. Have the students cut out the whole notes and place a piece of tape on the back of each one. While the students move to their assigned groups and get the notes ready, create a musical staff on the board for each team. Make sure they are a good distance from each other so the teams have enough room.

> Note: If you plan to use this activity multiple times, make a few copies of the next page on cardstock, cut out the notes, and laminate them so you can use them more than once.

Begin by selecting a word for each team. This can be the same word or a unique word for each team (make sure they have the same number of letters). Each team should discuss the word and decide how to spell it. Then, they will spell it on their musical staff. Letters that correspond to a note on the staff (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) will be "written" by placing a whole note in the appropriate location. Any other letters will be written out on the staff.

**Example:** To spell STAFF, write out the S and the T, and then place three whole notes next to them in the appropriate locations on the staff to finish spelling the word (A, F, and F).

The winner is the team that spells their word correctly and uses the whole notes when appropriate. If it is a tie, the team that finishes the fastest wins.

You can make the activity more challenging by turning it into a musical version of "Pin the Tail on the Donkey." Write out the letters that cannot be represented by notes on the staff, leaving enough space for the whole notes that will represent the other letters. Then, have each team blindfold one of their players and hand him or her a whole note with a piece of tape on the back. The team spins the player around twice and faces him or her toward the board. From this point on, the team may not touch the player. Team members must work together to give the player directions for placing the note correctly between the given letters and on the staff. If there is more than one letter missing, after the first note is placed, the next team member is blindfolded and given directions. The team that places their notes with the most accuracy is the winner.

# What Am I?

Create several lists of clues about the identity of a mystery musical object, similar to the example given below. Make sure to order the lists from general to specific. You can also use the objects and clues that are provided on the next page.

To play, begin by asking the students to number a blank sheet of paper from one to five. Read the first clue aloud to the students. Give each team 30 seconds to take a guess at the mystery object based on this first clue only and write it on the first line of their papers. The clues are given in order from general to specific, so it is unlikely a team will know the answer after the first clue (although they can guess anything that fits the clue).

After all teams have written an answer, read the first clue and the second clue aloud. Have the teams write down another guess on the second line based on the information from both clues. This can be the same answer they wrote on the first line or a completely different answer—that is up to the team.

Continue in this way until all clues from the set have been read aloud. Then ask the class, “What am I?” After the answer has been announced, determine the winning team by reviewing the students’ papers. The team that wrote the correct answer after the fewest clues is the winner!

## EXAMPLE:

1. I am a musical instrument.  
2. I am part of the orchestra.  
3. I am played using a mouthpiece.  
4. I am a brass instrument.  
5. I use a slide to change notes.

# My Many Musical Hats—The Game

To begin, have each student create a paper hat. Provide help when needed. Directions for making a simple hat are found on the next page.

Each student will also need a card with a musical term or instrument on it. Sample cards are provided on pages 44–45. You can make copies of the sample cards, or you can have each student make a card on a small piece of paper. If the students create cards, ask them to put their names on the back, and then collect the cards.

Select a few students to help demonstrate the activity before beginning with the rest of the class. To play, place a card in the brim of each student’s hat so that it is easily seen by the rest of the class. Do not let the students see the card in their own hats, and make sure students do not get the cards they created.

Divide the class into small groups of three to four students. Tell the students that the category of the card set is “Musical Terms and Instruments.” You can also separate the cards to create two sets (one musical terms set and one musical instruments set).

The object of the activity is for each student to identify the card in his or her hat by asking questions. Each student must ask a classmate a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ question about the card. This can be a simple question such as:

- Am I an instrument?  
- Am I a woodwind?  
- Am I a musical note?  

For example:  
Category—Musical Terms and Instruments  
John (eighth note pair): Am I a musical instrument?  
Peter (clarinet): No. Am I a woodwind?  
John (eighth note pair): Yes.

Students then move on to another classmate.

Once the students believe they know the identities of their cards, they may ask a student to confirm (“Am I a musical staff?”). This game can easily be repeated by mixing up the cards and redistributing them.

# My Many Musical Hats—The Hat

These hats are easy to make and can be used over and over again. Provide the students with markers, crayons, and colored pencils to decorate their hats before beginning the activities. This helps the students become more involved and allows them to show a bit of their creative side!

## FOLDING DIRECTIONS

1. Take a single sheet of newspaper (one page) or other suggested material (12" x 21" sheet of wrapping paper or butcher paper, or a paper grocery bag) in half.
2. Fold the top corners to the center of the paper, as shown.
3. Fold up the bottom edge of the paper so that it is even with the bottom of the triangles. Fold the bottom edge up again to form the brim of the hat.
4. Tuck in the corners on both sides of the hat.

If the hat is too small to stay comfortably on a student’s head, you can punch a hole in each side of the hat’s brim and tie a piece of string in each hole. These strings can then be tied under the student’s chin. Another option is to use a full sheet of newspaper (two pages), cut four to five inches off the bottom, and follow the directions above. This will make a bigger newspaper hat.

# Music Facts Finger Fun

Reproduce enough games for your classroom (games are provided on the next three pages), and allow your students to color their own Finger Fun games. When the students have finished coloring, have them cut the game out on the dotted line. Students will now have a square.

Demonstrate how to fold the games to the class by following the instructions below.

1. With the paper upside down, fold it along the diagonal and crease. Then open it back up. Fold along the opposite diagonal and crease. Open it back up. Fold the paper in half along a straight edge and crease. Open it back up. Turn the paper 90 degrees, fold it in half again, and crease. Open it back up. You should now have a flat piece of paper with the creases forming a star in the center of the page.

2. Take one corner and fold it in to the center of the star. Repeat with each corner. When you are done, you will have a six-inch square, with four open flaps on the top.

3. Turn the piece of paper over. Take one corner and fold it in to the center of star. Repeat with each corner.

4. Flip the paper over so that the top side has square flaps. Fold the paper in half along a straight edge and crease. Open it back up. Turn the paper 90 degrees, fold it in half again, and crease. There are now two square flaps on each side of the game.

5. With the crease at the bottom, insert your thumbs under each of the two flaps facing you. Insert your index fingers under the flaps directly opposite your thumbs. As you pinch your fingertips together and push them towards each other, the game will take shape.

To work the game, put your fingers back in the flaps. Pinch your thumb and index fingers together, then gently pull apart to open the center. Then bring the four fingers back together. Pinch together the two index fingers and the two thumbs. Gently pull apart to open the center.

Before beginning the game, make copies of the spinner below for students to use. You may want to enlarge it to 150% on a copier. To make the arrow (spinner), unfold a paper clip and place an end over the center of the spinner. Place a pencil on the center point and spin the paper clip.

# La Mer

by Claude Debussy (klohd deb-yoo-SEE) (1862–1918)

La mer means "the sea" in French. "Mer" is pronounced just like the English word for a female horse—mare.

Debussy spent two years composing *La Mer*. He finished writing it by the English Channel (a part of the Atlantic Ocean that separates England and France).

When *La Mer* was first performed in 1905, many people disliked it because it was very different from the music commonly played during that time.

Debussy used a famous painting of an ocean wave by Japanese artist Hokusai (Hoh-KOO-sigh) for the cover of the sheet music of *La Mer*.

The first movement, or section, of *La Mer* represents a calm morning on the sea.

From quiet waters to crashing waves, this piece by Claude Debussy paints a vivid picture of the majestic seas. In the main picture, circle or color the images that are paired with each fact, and discover more about these vast natural wonders. But be careful, a storm could hit at any time!

The Red Sea, located between Africa and Asia, is the saltiest sea in the world.

Debussy also wrote a piece called “Claire de Lune,” which means “moonlight” in French.

The largest animal that lives in the ocean is the blue whale.

A tsunami is a very large ocean wave often caused by an underwater earthquake. Tsunami is pronounced soo-NAH-me.

“Games of Waves” is the second movement of *La Mer*.

The third movement, “Dialogue of Wind and Sea,” uses the low sounds of the cello and string bass to signal an oncoming storm.

Debussy’s father was a sailor.

# Carnival of the Animals  
by Camille Saint-Saëns (ka-MEE-yuh san-SAHNS) (1835–1921)

Camille Saint-Saëns’s *Carnival of the Animals* is a suite for orchestra that is divided into fourteen sections, or movements. Twelve of the movements feature a different animal. Saint-Saëns was very particular about the instruments he chose to create the sounds of each animal, and the result is a musical celebration for creatures of all kinds! In the main picture, circle or color the images that are paired with each fact, and join the celebration!

To sound like an elephant, Saint-Saëns used the lowest sounding instrument in the orchestra—the string bass.

A xylophone is used to make the sound of a skeleton dancing.

The music from *Carnival of the Animals* was used in a 1976 Looney Toons cartoon featuring Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck.

The sound of young pianists playing scales is one of the movements in the piece.

Saint-Saëns wouldn’t let anyone play the music because he had written it as a musical joke for his friends.

You need your best nasally French voice to say Saint-Saëns’s name. It is pronounced “san” (rhymes with “can”) – “sahns.”

Camille Saint-Saëns and Franz Liszt (pronounced “list”), another composer, were very good friends.

Carnival of the Animals begins with the “Royal March of the Lion.”

“Fossils” contains part of the nursery rhyme “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.”

Stringed instruments and the piano are used to sound like chickens in “The Cuckoo.”

Camille Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, France.

# A Very Verdi Day

One of the greatest opera composers of all time is Giuseppe Verdi (Juh-SEP-pee VEAR-dee). Verdi was born in 1813 in Italy. Today, we celebrate his birthday on both the 9th and the 10th of October because no one is sure which of those dates is his actual birthday. (Wouldn’t it be cool to have two birthdays?)

Verdi, like other opera composers, wrote dramatic works driven by music. When these works are performed, all or most of the dialogue is sung. Often, operas are performed in the original language, even if it is foreign to the audience. This is because the music is considered the most important element in an opera. The singers and orchestra should portray the story and mood through the music.

Operas have been written about everything from love to important events in history to imaginary lands far away. Imagine the story you would tell in an opera. What is it about? Who are some of the characters? Can you think of a title?

# Can You Handel It?

## GEORGE FRIDERIC HANDEL (1685-1759)

One of the most famous Baroque composers, George Frideric Handel (George FREE-der-ich HAHN-dul) was one of the first composers who was able to make a living solely as a composer.

Born in Germany in 1685, Handel was trained as an organist and worked as a choir master there before moving to London, England, when he was 25. Handel loved England and stayed there for the rest of his life. (He’s even buried at Westminster Abbey, an honor reserved for only the most famous Brits.)

Although he wrote a lot of instrumental music and vocal solos, Handel’s first musical love was opera. He wrote more than 40 of them, but unfortunately the kind of operas that he liked to write—more serious operas in an Italian style called *opera seria*—were becoming less and less popular with the English people. Problem was, Handel was living a very extravagant life and composing was his only job. He needed a hit, and quick.

Handel found his “hit” in the form of oratorios. Oratorios (awr-uh-TAWR-ee-ohs) are extended choral works about a religious subject that have an orchestral accompaniment. They are like operas in that they tell a story with song and there are characters, but unlike opera, the performers don’t wear costumes and they don’t act out the story. The most famous of Handel’s oratorios is *Messiah*, which is often performed around Christmas and includes one of the most famous pieces of classical music—“Hallelujah Chorus.”

## PIOTR ILYICH TCHAIKOVSKY (1840–1893)

Toward the ♪ middle ♪ of the 19th century, countries began to celebrate their own heritage in the music written. In previous eras, ♪ music was thought to be very international; Italian operas was ♪ celebrated in Germany, and Austrian ♪ concertos ♪ were well-received in England. Around 1850, a nationalist movement took root in central Europe that highlighted both cultural and political differences among nations.

Piotr (Peter) Tchaikovsky said, “The ♪ Russian elements in my music are there because my childhood was imbued with the indescribable beauty of Russian ♪ folk ♪ music.” He was born in 1840, the son of a Russian engineer and a ♪ French ♪ mother. The ♪ family moved to St. Petersburg • when he was ten, ♪ and Peter was enrolled in a school that trained civil servants. By the age of 21, Tchaikovsky was ♪ justifiably ♪ unhappy with his bureaucratic ♪ life, so he enrolled ♪ in the new Moscow Conservatory and studied under Nikolay Rubinstein. ♪ The success of his first symphony encouraged him to • continue to compose.

Early in his career, Tchaikovsky was fortunate enough to attract the interest of a wealthy patroness and her support enabled him to devote ♪ himself ♪ to music. He wrote nine operas, four concertos, six symphonies, three ballets, string quartets, and many other songs and pieces for piano ♪ during this ♪ term. Later, when • this patronage was ♪ withdrawn, he was criticized for his refusal to embrace narrow Russian nationalist aims. Instead, he incorporated themes of Russian folklore and temperament into Western European forms and idioms. With his rich orchestrations, passionate lyricism, and extravagant emotionalism, Tchaikovsky became one of the world’s most popular classical composers.

♪ Peter ♪ Tchaikovsky was often moody and melancholy, and prone to ♪ fits of • depression. The • death of his ♪ beloved mother ♪ when he was 14 is said to have • been a trauma from which he never recovered. In 1877, he entered into a disastrous marriage with a student and soon thereafter fled to live in his brother’s house. Tchaikovsky never saw his wife again. Even when his personal life was in turmoil, he continued to compose. His first ballet, *Swan Lake*, was not an immediate success, but two ensuing ballet scores, *Sleeping Beauty* and *The Nutcracker*, were widely praised. All three works are still the cornerstones of classical ballet repertoire.

The first performance of the overture took place in Moscow, and Tchaikovsky had wanted to have all the church bells in the city peal out in the grand finale. The city fathers refused, and he had to be content with the tower bells in the cathedral in which the concert took place. The grand work was an immediate popular success. Tchaikovsky was obviously wrong in his assessment of this work when he commented that it was “loud and noisy and probably artistically worthless.”

By 1891, Peter Tchaikovsky became increasingly fearful and depressed and eventually died in St. Petersburg from cholera in 1893.

Note: Some puzzles could have additional (and often very creative) answers.

1. The letter A.
2. ONE MUSIC WORD
3. 7 minutes—just have all of the flute players play at the same time!
4. The man with the stick was the conductor; Elizabeth was a drummer in the orchestra.
5. Andy was now in second place.

1. In the dictionary
2. Ben plays the oboe. We see that Ben and Dylan sit across from each other, and Christine is to the left of Dylan. Christine plays the clarinet (both start with a C), Dora plays the flute (no reed), Dylan plays the saxophone (across from Ben), and Ben is left with the oboe.
3. Jimmy should pick one mouthpiece from the TUBA AND TRUMPET MOUTHPIECE box. Because he knows the box is labeled incorrectly, the mouthpiece he pulls out will be the correct box label. For example, if he pulled a tuba mouthpiece out of the box, he would label the box TUBA MOUTHPIECES. Now he would find the box originally labeled TUBA MOUTHPIECES and label it TRUMPET MOUTHPIECES. The last box would be changed to TUBA AND TRUMPET MOUTHPIECES.
4. The instruments and their sections have been switched in pairs. Woodwinds and brasswinds are flipped, and strings and percussion are flipped. Therefore, cellos would be found in the percussion section.

1. The songwriter was writing a song, and when he said “I need it much louder,” he was referring to the song he was working on. The songwriter was startled because he wasn’t actually speaking to the apprentice. Perhaps using a dynamic would have avoided all of the confusion!
2. The word is NOTE. Since none of the letters in the word CASH are used, the T is the only letter that can be used from the word HATS. Because T is the third letter, and H is in CASH, the only two letters left to be used in HOPE are the O and the E. The only other letter left is the first letter, which will be the N in NAIL.
3. Canada uses the metric system, so the speed limit was 90 kilometers per hour and not 90 miles per hour. 90 kilometers per hour is a little more than 55 mph, so at 75 mph Eliza was definitely speeding.
