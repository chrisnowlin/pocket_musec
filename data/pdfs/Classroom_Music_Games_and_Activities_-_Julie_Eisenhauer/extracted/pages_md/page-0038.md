# Hit the Note

Your teacher will assign partners. Find your partner, and sit facing him or her. Hide your paper behind a folder or other object so your partner cannot see it.

Now place five notes on the first music staff (one in each measure). They can be space notes or line notes. An example is below.

Take turns "searching" for notes. The person searching for a note will ask a question such as "Do you have an E in the first measure?" If that note is in the measure, the person says, "You hit the note!" If that note is not in the measure, the person says, "You missed the note!" If you hit a note, mark it down on the second staff. Make sure to mark where the note does not exist as well so you don't guess the same one twice!

The first player to find all five of his or her partner's notes is the winner!
