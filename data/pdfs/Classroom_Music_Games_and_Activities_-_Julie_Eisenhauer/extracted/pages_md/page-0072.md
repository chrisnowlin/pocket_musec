From quiet waters to crashing waves, this piece by Claude Debussy paints a vivid picture of the majestic seas. In the main picture, circle or color the images that are paired with each fact, and discover more about these vast natural wonders. But be careful, a storm could hit at any time!

The Red Sea, located between Africa and Asia, is the saltiest sea in the world.

Debussy also wrote a piece called “Claire de Lune,” which means “moonlight” in French.

The largest animal that lives in the ocean is the blue whale.

A tsunami is a very large ocean wave often caused by an underwater earthquake. Tsunami is pronounced soo-NAH-me.

“Games of Waves” is the second movement of *La Mer*.

The third movement, “Dialogue of Wind and Sea,” uses the low sounds of the cello and string bass to signal an oncoming storm.

Debussy’s father was a sailor.
