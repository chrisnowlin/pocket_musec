# Rake the Leaves

There are four kinds of notes in this puzzle:

Quarter Note = 1 beat  
Half Note = 2 beats  
Dotted Half Note = 3 beats  
Whole Note = 4 beats  

All the leaves are falling, and it’s time to rake them up. If a note is one beat, color it orange. If it is two beats, color it yellow. If it is three beats, color it red. If it is four beats, color it brown.

Then, draw a line to connect all the quarter-note leaves to the trashcan, all the half-note leaves to the basket, all the dotted half-note leaves to the wheelbarrow, and all the whole-note leaves to the lawn bag.
