Dynamic markings indicate the "louds" and "softs" in music. From softest to loudest, they are:

**pp**  
*pianissimo*  
(pee-uh-NIS-uh-moh)  
very soft

**p**  
*piano*  
(pee-AN-oh)  
soft

**mp**  
*mezzo piano*  
(MET-soh pee-AN-o)  
medium soft

**mf**  
*mezzo forte*  
(MET-soh FAWR-tey)  
medium loud

**f**  
*forte*  
(FAWR-tey)

**ff**  
*fortissimo*  
(fawr-TIS-uh-moh)  
very loud

Trace each dynamic marking below:
