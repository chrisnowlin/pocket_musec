# La Mer

by Claude Debussy (klohd deb-yoo-SEE) (1862–1918)

La mer means "the sea" in French. "Mer" is pronounced just like the English word for a female horse—mare.

Debussy spent two years composing *La Mer*. He finished writing it by the English Channel (a part of the Atlantic Ocean that separates England and France).

When *La Mer* was first performed in 1905, many people disliked it because it was very different from the music commonly played during that time.

Debussy used a famous painting of an ocean wave by Japanese artist Hokusai (Hoh-KOO-sigh) for the cover of the sheet music of *La Mer*.

The first movement, or section, of *La Mer* represents a calm morning on the sea.
