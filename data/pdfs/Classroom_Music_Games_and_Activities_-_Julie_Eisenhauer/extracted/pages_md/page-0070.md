# Composer Connect the Dots

Connect the dots from 1 (in the bottom right corner) to 228 to reveal a portrait of one of the great masters of classical music. Who is it? He’s German. He wrote nine symphonies. He began to lose his hearing when he was still young and was completely deaf later in life, but he continued to write wonderful music. Have you connected these dots yet?
