**"O Canada"**

*Robert Stanley Weir*

O Canada!  
Our home and native land!  
True patriot love  
in all thy sons command.  
With glowing hearts  
We see thee rise,  
The True North strong and free!  
From far and wide  
O Canada,  
we stand on guard for thee.  
God keep our land  
Glorious and free!  
O Canada  
we stand on guard for thee.  
O Canada  
we stand on guard for thee.
