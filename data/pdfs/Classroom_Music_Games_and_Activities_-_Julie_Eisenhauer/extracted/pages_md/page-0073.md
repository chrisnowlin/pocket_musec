# Carnival of the Animals  
by Camille Saint-Saëns (ka-MEE-yuh san-SAHNS) (1835–1921)

Camille Saint-Saëns’s *Carnival of the Animals* is a suite for orchestra that is divided into fourteen sections, or movements. Twelve of the movements feature a different animal. Saint-Saëns was very particular about the instruments he chose to create the sounds of each animal, and the result is a musical celebration for creatures of all kinds! In the main picture, circle or color the images that are paired with each fact, and join the celebration!

To sound like an elephant, Saint-Saëns used the lowest sounding instrument in the orchestra—the string bass.

A xylophone is used to make the sound of a skeleton dancing.

The music from *Carnival of the Animals* was used in a 1976 Looney Toons cartoon featuring Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck.

The sound of young pianists playing scales is one of the movements in the piece.

Saint-Saëns wouldn’t let anyone play the music because he had written it as a musical joke for his friends.
