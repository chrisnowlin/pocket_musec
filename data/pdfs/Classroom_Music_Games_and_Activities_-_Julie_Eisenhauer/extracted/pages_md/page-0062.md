# The Hidden Path

Let the music alphabet guide you through the maze below! You start on A and then move to a neighboring note in the music alphabet (G or B). As you look for the next note that steps up or down, remember that you can only move up, down, left or right (not diagonally). Travel soundly!

**Bonus:** Name each note in the grid.
