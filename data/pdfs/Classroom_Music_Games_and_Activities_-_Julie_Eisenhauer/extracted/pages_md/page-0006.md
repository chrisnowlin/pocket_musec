# The Name Game

In this exercise, students will create interesting rhythmic patterns by using their own names. Say your name out loud for the class, clapping each syllable. For example:

Say:          Miss – us Al – ex – an – der  
Clap (x):     x    x x  x    x    x

Have your students say and clap your name back to you.

Have each student say and clap his or her name. Have the class echo each student by saying and clapping that student’s name in exactly the same way. After each student has “performed” his or her name, discuss the following:

1. Who had the longest name with the most claps?
2. Who had the shortest name with the least number of claps?

Use the following ideas to continue the game after all of the students have said and clapped their own names:

1. Pick your favorite sports figure, and say and clap his or her name.
2. Pick your favorite TV or movie star, and say and clap his or her name.
3. Pick a mystery person. Give a clue about this person, then only clap his or her name (don’t say the name out loud). See if the class can guess the person’s name.

For example:  
Clue:         A kindly president with a beard who often wore a tall, black hat  
Clap:         x x  x  x  x  
Answer:       Abraham Lincoln
