# How to SUDOKU!

Sudoku puzzles can be a lot of fun. The rules are simple, but the puzzles are challenging. Keep the symbols straight, and you will be successful.

The easiest kind of Sudoku puzzle is the 4x4 grid.

Here are a few things to know about doing a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle:

- Each row must have four different symbols in the boxes (in this case, the symbols will be ♪, ♩, ♫, and ♫). Each row can only have one of each symbol in it.

AND

- Each column must have the symbols ♪, ♩, ♫, and ♫ in the boxes. Each column can only have one of each symbol in it.

AND

- Each small grid must have the symbols ♪, ♩, ♫, and ♫ in the boxes. Each small grid can only have one of each symbol in it. (You can see the small grids because they have a dark outline.)

Put all of these rules together to fill out your Sudoku grid! Some puzzles might be bigger than 4x4. You can still use the same rules for these puzzles.

Sometimes you might get stumped on a puzzle. To help get back on track, look for a row, column, or grid that has many symbols already filled in. Look at the symbols, and see what is still missing:

The top row of this grid already has the symbols ♩, ♪, and ♫. What’s missing?

That’s right – the symbol ♪! Fill it in, and then do it again!
