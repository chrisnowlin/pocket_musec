# A Very Verdi Day

One of the greatest opera composers of all time is Giuseppe Verdi (Juh-SEP-pee VEAR-dee). Verdi was born in 1813 in Italy. Today, we celebrate his birthday on both the 9th and the 10th of October because no one is sure which of those dates is his actual birthday. (Wouldn’t it be cool to have two birthdays?)

Verdi, like other opera composers, wrote dramatic works driven by music. When these works are performed, all or most of the dialogue is sung. Often, operas are performed in the original language, even if it is foreign to the audience. This is because the music is considered the most important element in an opera. The singers and orchestra should portray the story and mood through the music.

Operas have been written about everything from love to important events in history to imaginary lands far away. Imagine the story you would tell in an opera. What is it about? Who are some of the characters? Can you think of a title?
