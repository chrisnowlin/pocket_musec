# Listen Carefully

Teams of students need to listen carefully to various songs to identify musical instruments and win points in this activity.

Divide the class into small teams. Play a short song, or part of a song. Instruct the teams to listen carefully and try to pick out as many instruments as possible. After the song has ended, have students raise their hands and identify as many different instruments as they heard. Each correct guess receives one point for the team.

Students can also enjoy this activity with clips that demonstrate only one instrument at a time. Play a sound, and have team members work together to identify the instrument. Each correct answer receives a point, and the team with the most points at the end of the game is the winner!

After guesses have been made, play each song again and discuss them with the class. Encourage students to think about the songs by asking questions:
- Is it loud or soft?
- Is it fast or slow?
- Is it high or low?
- When might you hear it?
- How does it make you feel?

As an alternative to songs, have the students listen to various sound effects to identify sounds and win points. Inexpensive sound effects CDs can be found at electronics stores and discount stores. You may even have one left over from a school play!
