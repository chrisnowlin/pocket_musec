## Sally Saxophone Wants a Snare Drum  

Sally has been playing the saxophone for two years, but now she wants to play the snare drum. Help her get to the end of the maze—where a snare drum awaits her—by making a path that alternates wind instruments with percussion instruments. (Remember, wind instruments include both woodwinds and brass instruments.) You can move up and down, or side to side, but not diagonally. If you hit a string instrument, you’re going the wrong direction.
