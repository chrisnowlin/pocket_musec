# Action!

Play any piece of music while the students dance around the room. Ask students to move slowly when the music is quiet and quickly when it is loud. Start the music at a low volume, and have the students begin dancing slowly around the room. As the students dance and the song plays, adjust the volume and watch as the students change speed.

Once they have mastered the changes in volume, ask them to show how the music makes them feel as they dance around. For example, if the music is fast and upbeat, they should move quickly. If it is slow and soft, they should move slowly. Upbeat music may make them jump up high, while soft music may make them move closer to the ground. Let them be creative and show off their moves!

# Follow the Leader. . . Sometimes

Begin this alternative version of Simon Says by gathering students where they can easily see you. Make sure the students have enough space to move. Say the name of a musical instrument, and act out how the instrument would be played. Have the students “play” the instrument with you.

Continue naming instruments and acting them out. Then, name an instrument, but act out a completely different instrument. The students that “play” the instrument incorrectly with you are out. See how many students you can confuse with your acting ability!
