# Character Connections

Collect a variety of small percussion instruments (one for each student), and select a story to read aloud to the class. If you do not have percussion instruments, you can use body percussion or found sounds (tapping a pen on a table, shaking a can with pennies in it, etc.).

Divide the class into groups, assign each a character in the story, and assign a percussion instrument or sound for each character. For example:

**Story:**  
Cinderella  

**Characters:**  
Cinderella, Stepmother, Stepsisters, Fairy Godmother, Prince  

**Instruments:**  
- Cinderella – finger cymbals/clap hands  
- Stepmother – egg shaker/snap fingers  
- Stepsisters – rhythm sticks/stomp feet  
- Fairy Godmother – woodblock/tap fingers  
- Prince – triangle/whistle  

> **Note:** If possible, assign a sound that matches the character’s personality or actions in the story.

Read the story aloud to the class and have each group play their instruments when their assigned character is mentioned. Be sure to allow time in your reading for the instruments to be played.

# That’s Debatable

Pretend that the class is creating a TV show for the classroom, and they need to decide on theme music. Select a recording of your choice, and play it for the class.

Divide the class into two teams. Assign one team to argue in favor of using the recording (the “pro” side) and the other team to argue against using the recording (the “con” side). Play the recording again. Then, give the teams time to discuss their arguments with their teammates, reminding them that they will be expected to use their music vocabulary.

After the teams have had time to work on their arguments, set up the classroom with one team on one side of the room and the other team on the opposite side. Let the teams debate the issue in an orderly way, making sure students raise their hands and only one person speaks at a time. The students should use as many music terms in their arguments as possible. The most convincing team is the winner!

Help students learn to argue their points and use music vocabulary by keeping the debate going throughout the year. Select different recordings to use as a classroom theme, or change the scenario. Would this be a good theme for the class? For the school? For a cartoon? For a comedy? For an action movie?
