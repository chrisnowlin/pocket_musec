# Musician Portrait Gallery

If you could meet any musician—past or present—who would you want to meet and why? What are three questions you would ask?




In order to meet the musician, you need to bring a portrait of him or her. Draw the artist in the frame below. In the space next to the frame, write a brief biography of the musician (use information you have learned in class or research from other sources). Discuss your opinions as a class.
