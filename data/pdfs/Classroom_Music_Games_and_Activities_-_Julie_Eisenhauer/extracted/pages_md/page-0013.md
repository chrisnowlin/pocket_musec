# Story Soundtrack

Movies and television shows have soundtracks with a variety of music and sounds. The music varies depending on what is occurring in the story at the time.

Choose a short story that includes changes in pacing or mood with both good and evil characters. Read it by yourself and determine sounds or music clips that would go well with different parts of the story. Mark some of them before the part in the story and others after the part in the story.

Explain to students that you have created a soundtrack for the story you are about to read. For parts that you have found an appropriate clip or sound for, play it as you read. After a clip is played, ask the students:

- Do you think the sound belongs to what just happened or what is about to happen?

For sound clips that belong to what just happened, ask the following questions:

- How does the sound make you feel about what happened?
- What are some other sounds that you would use here instead?
- Can you think of any songs that could be used?

For clips that belong to what is about to happen, ask the following questions:

- What do you think will happen next?
- Who do you think will be involved?
- How does the soundtrack affect your emotions? Does it make you scared or excited for what could happen?

> **Note:** Answers to these questions will vary.  
Encourage students to discuss the various ideas and come to a conclusion before continuing.
