# Breath Control

Breath control is necessary for singers and for musicians who play wind instruments. It lets them sing or play for short or long periods, to raise and lower their volume, and to time taking breaths between words or notes.

Clear plenty of space on the floor in the classroom. Divide the class into groups of at least four students, and distribute the groups in various places in the room. In each group’s area, mark the ground with two long strips of masking tape three to four feet apart (it may be beneficial to do this before class begins). Divide each group into two smaller groups, and have each small group kneel down behind one of the tape strips.

Place a ping-pong ball, small balloon, or other lightweight object within the tape strips. Signal the players to start blowing the items across the other team’s “goal line.” Players cannot use their hands or cross the goal line with their knees. When a goal is scored, place the object back within the tape strips. The side scoring the most goals in five minutes is the winner. This game may also be played with the entire class in two groups.
