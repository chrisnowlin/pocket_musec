# Creative Symbols

Divide the class into groups, and provide each group with crayons, markers, or colored pencils. Post a large sheet of paper for each group at various places in the room. (You can also use the chalkboard, or give each group a sheet of paper to put on the floor.)

Using a large black marker, draw a music symbol on each group’s paper (some symbol suggestions are listed below). Draw the same symbol on every group’s paper. Talk about the symbol with the students—what does it mean? When is it used?

Give each group five minutes to draw a picture that uses the symbol you have provided.

You may want to do a quick example drawing to help the students get started. The group can draw any picture they choose, but they must work together on the same paper. At the end of the five minutes, have each group present their picture to the rest of the class.
