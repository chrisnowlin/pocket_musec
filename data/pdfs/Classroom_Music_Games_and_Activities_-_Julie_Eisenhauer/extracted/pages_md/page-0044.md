# My Many Musical Hats—The Hat

These hats are easy to make and can be used over and over again. Provide the students with markers, crayons, and colored pencils to decorate their hats before beginning the activities. This helps the students become more involved and allows them to show a bit of their creative side!

## FOLDING DIRECTIONS

1. Take a single sheet of newspaper (one page) or other suggested material (12" x 21" sheet of wrapping paper or butcher paper, or a paper grocery bag) in half.
2. Fold the top corners to the center of the paper, as shown.
3. Fold up the bottom edge of the paper so that it is even with the bottom of the triangles. Fold the bottom edge up again to form the brim of the hat.
4. Tuck in the corners on both sides of the hat.

If the hat is too small to stay comfortably on a student’s head, you can punch a hole in each side of the hat’s brim and tie a piece of string in each hole. These strings can then be tied under the student’s chin. Another option is to use a full sheet of newspaper (two pages), cut four to five inches off the bottom, and follow the directions above. This will make a bigger newspaper hat.
