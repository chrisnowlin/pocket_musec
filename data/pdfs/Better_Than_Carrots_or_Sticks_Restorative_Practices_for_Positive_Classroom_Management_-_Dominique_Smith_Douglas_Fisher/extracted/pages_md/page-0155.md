Creating the Mindset for Restorative Practices | 149

Brandi was one of those students who exhibited “hope, engagement, and general well-being.” Despite growing up in poverty and not scoring very well on her initial assessments for reading or math, she developed a fantastic sense of herself and her future. “I have hope for a better life because people care about it,” she told us. “I mean, all those people can’t be wrong. I must be a pretty amazing person if they all like me so much. I know that I’m loved, and that gives me hope. I don’t want to disappoint the people who love me—or myself. I know that I’m ready to graduate high school and go to college after that. I have hope, and a plan to get where I’m going, because people cared about me.”

## Conclusion

We will conclude this book the way we began it—with an invitation to learn. Consider how different the fates of the students Gallup surveyed who were not “success-ready” would be if they had regularly encountered intentionally inviting adults throughout the school day. Students who feel hopeful and cared for are able to achieve at higher levels—and the best news is that it is within our power to help them do so.
