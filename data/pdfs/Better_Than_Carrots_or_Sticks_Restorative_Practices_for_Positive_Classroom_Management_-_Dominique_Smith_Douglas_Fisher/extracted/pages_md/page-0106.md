- It’s brief.
- Students aren’t threatened with punishment.
- The teacher asked each student for his version of what happened.
- The teacher shared her own feelings.
- The teacher reminded the students that they are accountable to others.
- The teacher asked the students to suggest ways to resolve the problem.
- The teacher modeled how to communicate with someone who disagrees with you.

When Nancy taught 4th grade, she set up a “peace table” in her classroom for resolving student conflicts. It really wasn’t much—just a desk with a feathered pen in a holder. Whenever students had a conflict, they were each to draft a “peace-table statement” before coming together to meet with Nancy. Every statement had to have three distinct elements:

1. An explanation of what the disagreement was about.
2. An “I” statement explaining the writer’s feelings (“When you _____, I felt _____. I would like ____.”).
3. An “I” statement explaining what the writer thinks the other person might say (“When you _____, I felt _____. I would like ____.”).
