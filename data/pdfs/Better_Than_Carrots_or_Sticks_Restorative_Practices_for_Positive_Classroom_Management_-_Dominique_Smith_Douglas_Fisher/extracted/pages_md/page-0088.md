# 4 Peace Building: Using Informal Restorative Practices Every Day

It’s hard to forget the ones we lose. Several years ago, before we knew about restorative practices, a 10th grade student we’ll call Phillip enrolled in our school. From the first day, he made his presence known: He was profane and hostile, and he used his physical stature to intimidate others. Although never physically violent with us, he clearly communicated his disdain for school and every adult in it. Uncooperative in class, he quickly developed a reputation among students as someone to avoid. Administrators responded in the usual ways, by turns cajoling him, bargaining with him, isolating him, and suspending him. Nothing worked. A parent meeting with Phillip’s father ended disastrously, suggesting that Phillip’s behavior reflected his upbringing. Within six months, Phillip had withdrawn from the school because the family moved to a new apartment. Frankly, we all breathed a sigh of relief.

But Doug stayed in contact with Phillip, who had a bumpy academic road: he was suspended regularly and transferred a few times, but he managed to stay in school and graduate. Phillip admitted to Doug that he had made his own life more difficult, especially by using alcohol and drugs, but that he’d managed to overcome these hurdles. After Phillip graduated, Doug asked him how he thought he’d succeeded in making it through school.
