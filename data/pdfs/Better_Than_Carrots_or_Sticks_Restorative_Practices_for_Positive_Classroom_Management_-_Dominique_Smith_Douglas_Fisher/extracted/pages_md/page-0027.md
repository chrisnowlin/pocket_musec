# 2 Relationships and Meaningful Instruction: The Foundations of Restorative Practices

---

Jeremy scrambles off the bus each day because he likes to be the first one to arrive at his 2nd grade classroom. It wasn’t always that way. His mother recalls not too long ago, when the start of every school day morning was a battle.

“I’d do everything to get him moving toward school,” she says. “I’d make his favorite breakfast, promise him a treat after school, and when that didn’t work I’d yell at him. I had no idea what he was facing.”

Jeremy is fortunate: his elementary school focuses on restorative practices. Through problem-solving discussions with his family, teacher, and several other caring adults, the school learned that he had difficulty with several other boys in his class and that the deteriorating relationships were taking a toll on him. Jeremy wasn’t being bullied, and he wasn’t always in the right himself, but he needed help repairing relationships with some of his classmates. Jeremy’s teacher realized that by employing more explicit social and emotional learning opportunities in her classroom, she could promote healthier relationships with all of her students. Of all the interventions she implemented, setting aside a few minutes to talk with Jeremy each morning may well have been the most important. It wasn’t the content of the conversations that mattered; it was the fact that his teacher made him feel valued.
