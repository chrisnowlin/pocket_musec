## 5 Peacemaking: Strategic Implementation of Formal Restorative Practices

We have all been wronged. Sometimes these wrongs are fairly minor in the big scheme of things; other times they are significant and painful. We do not want to discount the harm that students, staff, teachers, administrators, and parents can cause to others, as it can be very damaging to relationships and thus compromise students’ ability to learn and teachers’ ability to teach. When wrongs occur, we demand justice—but it’s how we define *justice* that matters.

As we’ve noted, traditional discipline efforts focus on determining guilt and punishing the offender. In this context, justice means that the offender receives an undesirable consequence that typically involves shame, isolation, and exclusion. Restorative practices take a more educative approach, mobilizing resources to ensure that students continue to learn.

Think about a time when you were personally wronged, intentionally or unintentionally. We were challenged with this prompt during our first professional development session focused on restorative practices. Teachers, staff members, and leaders were asked to write a journal entry about a specific experience, knowing that they would be asked to share their experience with a peer.
