## The Value of Understanding Escalation and De-escalation

Perhaps the most important advice that we can offer is to avoid escalating situations whenever possible. All too often, adults become too confrontational and assert their power too forcefully. Wolfgang (2001) suggests that teachers can respond to problematic behaviors along a continuum based on the severity or intensity of the issue:

1. **Looking**—making eye contact or using a simple gesture
2. **Naming**—talking quietly to the student, identifying the problematic behavior
3. **Questioning**—asking the student what he or she should be doing at the moment
4. **Commanding**—informing the student what needs to be done instead of the problematic behavior and may note consequences for not complying
5. **Directing**—the teacher physically preventing the problematic behavior from happening (such as separating students who are fighting)

Some situations require teachers to do very little, while others require them to exert a moderate level of control and power. In these cases, teachers call out the misbehavior, label it problematic, and name their desired replacement behavior. Think back to our earlier example of the three disruptive students in the first-year teacher’s class. Had the students’ misbehavior persisted after the teacher’s initial intervention, the teacher might have intervened a second time to address them in a more commanding manner:

> When you leave your group and interrupt the other groups, you are interfering with their learning. Worse yet, you are not making it possible for your own learning to happen. You need to stay within your own group and signal to me
