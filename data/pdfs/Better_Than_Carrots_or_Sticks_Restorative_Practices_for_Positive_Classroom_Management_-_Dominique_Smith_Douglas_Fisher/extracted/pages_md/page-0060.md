but will rarely invoke them after that—usually because they haven’t thought through potentially necessary procedures.

**Creating Procedures with Self-Regulation in Mind**

As we previously noted, our academic, behavioral, and disciplinary efforts should focus on developing self-regulated learners who have a growing capacity to manage their lives independently. But self-regulation is the product of trial and error—missteps are essential to its refinement. If classroom procedures do not support self-regulation,
