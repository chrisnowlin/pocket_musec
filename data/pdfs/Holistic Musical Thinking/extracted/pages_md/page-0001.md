# Holistic Musical Thinking

*Holistic Musical Thinking* presents a comprehensive view of how people engage with music from a hands-on and heart-felt perspective. This approach embraces the teaching and learning processes as a multi-dimensional amalgamation of knowing, doing, and feeling through musical experiences. The result is a five-dimensional model that synthesizes cognitive, affective, and psychomotor learning with curricular integration.

With pedagogical applications, *Holistic Musical Thinking* offers a multi-faceted perspective that benefits both music teachers and their students. This innovative approach uses established research for a new model of musical thinking and taxonomy of musical engagement. Complete with classroom vignettes and pedagogical strategies, this book reframes musical thinking as a new direction in music education. Written for music teachers, teacher-educators, and their students, this book provides practical applications of the multi-dimensional Model of Holistic Musical Thinking for K-12 music education, and beyond.
